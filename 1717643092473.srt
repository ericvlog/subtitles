1
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,538
Yuriko, here we go.

2
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:55,738
Yes.

3
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:59,922
I'll measure the height.

4
00:01:00,922 --> 00:01:03,922
5'6 and a half.

5
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:05,922
The top.

6
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:09,306
The height is 8.

7
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:11,306
Please.

8
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:13,306
Let's go, Mako.

9
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,306
Here we go.

10
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:57,578
The mayor's office is still here.

11
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:00,758
Excuse me.

12
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:02,758
I'm going in there too.

13
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:03,758
Oh, okay.

14
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,118
I can't even organize the passers-by.

15
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:09,118
You idiot.

16
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:11,618
Excuse me.

17
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:22,386
Hey!

18
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:26,546
Excuse me, can you move?

19
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,786
No!

20
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:28,786
Oh, you want to see?

21
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:31,186
You're so annoying.

22
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:33,026
I'm sorry, I'll go this way.

23
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:34,026
Are you okay?

24
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:40,802
Yes, around there.

25
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:42,502
Here we go.

26
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:43,162
Reifu.

27
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,102
Yes.

28
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:46,502
It's still in.

29
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:49,002
Shikano!

30
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,602
I'm sorry, you did it on purpose, didn't you?

31
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:55,082
No, I didn't.

32
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:58,822
The support is for everyone.

33
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:01,230
Now, please take a look.

34
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,930
I'm sorry, I'm filming right now,

35
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,770
can you move over there?

36
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,766
Well, good job.

37
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:40,766
Good job.

38
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:46,246
Eat the vegetables properly or you'll die.

39
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,130
So, what's going on?

40
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,910
I'm moving out.

41
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,910
Where?

42
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,070
It's a secret.

43
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,210
You can't just not know the address of the teacher.

44
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:29,278
I won't let you in the next room.

45
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,278
I know that.

46
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:35,458
Women are so stubborn.

47
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,958
Stop it.

48
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,658
It's fine.

49
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:41,318
You're splitting up.

50
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:43,318
Are you mad?

51
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:45,318
We split up.

52
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,318
I don't date girls like you.

53
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:52,550
Then what are we?

54
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,550
We're both superiors and subordinates.

55
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,878
We're both superiors and subordinates.

56
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:02,878
Ouch!

57
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:04,878
I'll post it on social media.

58
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:06,878
Can you do that even after you're done with your career?

59
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:09,878
You're that kind of person too.

60
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:11,878
You're that kind of person too.

61
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,878
You're that kind of person too.

62
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:20,102
I can't take a good picture of you talking like that.

63
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:23,102
Listen.

64
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:26,102
We have to stay away from the common sense.

65
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:28,102
You're a little...

66
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:30,102
Excuse me.

67
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,270
Hey.

68
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,430
Hey.

69
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:40,302
What are you doing?

70
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,534
Who's driving?

71
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:34,898
Thank you everyone!

72
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,898
It was Shinji!

73
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:42,706
That's right!

74
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:51,250
If you can, please fold your feelings and ask!

75
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,250
Thank you very much!

76
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:01,642
Thank you very much!

77
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:05,906
Thank you very much!

78
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,370
What is it?

79
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,370
I'm finally out.

80
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,290
You've got the job offer, right?

81
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,290
I'll forgive you if you do.

82
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,290
Please don't call me anymore.

83
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,290
There's no one.

84
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,290
But...

85
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,130
I can't.

86
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,690
Die.

87
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:27,942
It's a sea.

88
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:35,458
It's the sky.

89
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:49,982
Do you earn money by climbing a mountain pass?

90
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:52,862
It depends on the person.

91
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:56,822
I'm already a hard worker.

92
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,362
That's tough.

93
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:03,662
I can't help it. I'm the only one who can do it.

94
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:08,926
What kind of photos do you take?

95
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:14,886
I take pictures of landscapes and people.

96
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,186
Are they interesting?

97
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:24,226
Don't you think of them as delicious or nostalgic?

98
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:26,186
They look delicious?

99
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:27,986
I don't think so.

100
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:31,326
You want to take pictures of them.

101
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,002
I'll call the police.

102
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:18,002
What?

103
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:20,002
I'll call the police!

104
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:21,002
Are you a child?

105
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:22,002
Mom!

106
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:23,002
I know, I know.

107
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:25,002
Mom!

108
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:29,002
So?

109
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:32,002
Your wife found out about the cheating and kicked you out of the house.

110
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:36,002
Did you get cheated by another woman?

111
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:39,002
I was looking at you.

112
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:43,002
So I'm going to train you.

113
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,002
Before you become a citizen.

114
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:49,002
You need a lot of experience to become a cameraman.

115
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,002
It hurts.

116
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,002
Thank you very much.

117
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:56,002
Wait, wait, wait.

118
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:57,002
Shall we call the driver?

119
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:58,002
Is it okay around Kowahara-kun?

120
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,002
Of course.

121
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:01,002
It's really good.

122
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:03,002
I'm going to be alone for a while.

123
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:04,002
It's good.

124
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:05,002
I have a project for you.

125
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:06,002
What?

126
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:07,002
Yeah.

127
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:08,002
Let's shoot it next time.

128
00:12:08,002 --> 00:12:09,002
Is that true?

129
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:10,002
Yeah.

130
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,002
Here, have the same amount.

131
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:14,002
Okay.

132
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,002
It's a magic.

133
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,002
Magic.

134
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:20,002
I'll give you a Zitonic.

135
00:12:20,002 --> 00:12:21,002
Yes.

136
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,002
It's okay.

137
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,002
What is it?

138
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:36,042
Are you her boyfriend?

139
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,042
Have you gotten involved?

140
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,042
Have you done it?

141
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,042
It's a little...

142
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:45,082
I'm coming again.

143
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:15,846
I'm going to drink with you.

144
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:19,846
I know your picture is boring.

145
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:21,846
I'm going to puke.

146
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:22,846
What?

147
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:24,846
I'm sure you have sex.

148
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,846
I think so.

149
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:27,846
I'm going to puke.

150
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,846
You are a fool.

151
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:32,846
Do you want to be a comedian?

152
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,846
Do you want to be Kamitama?

153
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,846
I will never be like you.

154
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:37,846
Stop it.

155
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:40,846
Stop it?

156
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:42,846
You are not a child to be told.

157
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:43,846
I'm going to puke.

158
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:45,846
Stop it.

159
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:47,846
I'm going to puke.

160
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:48,846
Hey.

161
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:49,846
I'm going to puke.

162
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:56,846
Doctor.

163
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:57,846
Yes.

164
00:13:57,846 --> 00:13:58,846
Mr. Joe.

165
00:13:58,846 --> 00:13:59,846
Yes.

166
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:03,846
I'm going to call a rest stop.

167
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:04,846
Yes.

168
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:05,846
Yes.

169
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,838
I'm leaving.

170
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:10,838
No.

171
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:12,838
Let's go.

172
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:13,838
Are you okay?

173
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:14,838
I'm fine.

174
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:15,838
Wait.

175
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,350
Go, go, go!

176
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,350
Go, go, go!

177
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,850
Go, go, go!

178
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,850
Is that monkey a monkey?

179
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:43,426
He was a quadruped for a while.

180
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,998
Do you have a kid like that?

181
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:51,570
I saw him on some TV show.

182
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,570
I was the best in the race.

183
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,706
Then I started to look like a monkey.

184
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:03,706
I was happy because everyone liked it.

185
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:07,706
That's why my nickname was monkey.

186
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:14,338
Christ!

187
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:24,338
You're a little...

188
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:27,330
...tough.

189
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,330
Shut up!

190
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:31,498
I said that in monkey language.

191
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,498
What's that?

192
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:36,998
I'm a glasses.

193
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:38,998
Why?

194
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:41,998
Since I was little,

195
00:15:41,998 --> 00:15:43,998
I've had really bad eyesight.

196
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:45,998
I've been wearing glasses all the time.

197
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:47,998
Now I only wear contacts.

198
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,198
What happens if you take off your contacts?

199
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,198
I can't see anything. It's dangerous.

200
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:55,198
I'm like, where are my glasses?

201
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:57,198
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,198
I'm serious.

203
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,198
Let's show them our 4th grade.

204
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,198
Are you sure?

205
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:05,198
I'm sure.

206
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:16,766
Uki, uki, uki, uki, uki.

207
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:22,066
Uki, uki, uki, uki, uki.

208
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,586
I got something.

209
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:31,746
What is this?

210
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:35,578
It's a fire.

211
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,578
Really?

212
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:39,578
I wonder if it's okay.

213
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:41,578
It's amazing.

214
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:42,578
It's impossible.

215
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:43,578
It's a secret.

216
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:45,578
Are you okay?

217
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:49,578
Let's try it.

218
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:50,578
It's a fire.

219
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:52,578
There's a fire.

220
00:16:56,674 --> 00:16:57,674
This?

221
00:16:57,674 --> 00:16:58,674
It's good.

222
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:40,714
Cheers!

223
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:42,714
Cheers!

224
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:56,858
Want to see?

225
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,858
Yeah!

226
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,970
I like it.

227
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,970
It feels nostalgic.

228
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,234
Really?

229
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:21,234
The person who took the photo is very unique.

230
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,234
It's like you.

231
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:27,786
What kind of person?

232
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:35,074
Kind and lonely.

233
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:40,138
Why?

234
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:43,466
It reminds me of my childhood.

235
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:50,986
Thank you.

236
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,314
I've never heard that before.

237
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:57,314
Ororo?

238
00:18:58,314 --> 00:18:59,314
What?

239
00:19:00,314 --> 00:19:01,314
Are you crying?

240
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:03,314
Are you drunk?

241
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:09,322
Yeah, I'm drooling.

242
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,650
Yes.

243
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,998
Wait, wait, wait.

244
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:54,498
I'm surprised.

245
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:56,398
Are you okay?

246
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:59,898
I was here when you did the quadruple-throwing.

247
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:01,898
Wait, wait, wait.

248
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:02,698
I'm sorry.

249
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:03,498
Wait.

250
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:04,298
Let's go over there.

251
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:04,898
Over there?

252
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:05,898
Let's go over there.

253
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:06,398
Okay.

254
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,298
Wait.

255
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:12,498
I'm drunk.

256
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,198
Okay, okay, okay.

257
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:18,198
Thank you.

258
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,198
Here.

259
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:39,794
Oh, my God!

260
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:40,794
I'm sorry.

261
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,254
I'm sorry.

262
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,478
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:31,994 --> 00:21:33,994
Good luck!

264
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:37,922
I'll do my best!

265
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,282
Let's go!

266
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,570
Music!

267
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,570
Music?

268
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,570
Something, something.

269
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,570
First.

270
00:21:58,706 --> 00:21:59,706
Good.

271
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:01,874
Good.

272
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,290
It's okay, one more time!

273
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,290
It's okay, one more time!

274
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:15,162
That hurts.

275
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:17,162
How long does it take?

276
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:19,162
I don't know, I lost my mind.

277
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:20,162
I see.

278
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:22,162
Good job.

279
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:23,162
Good job.

280
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,114
This is the worst.

281
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:32,114
Two months of Matsuba.

282
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:34,114
How much did you earn?

283
00:22:35,114 --> 00:22:36,114
This much.

284
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:39,114
We don't have a job to think about.

285
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:43,114
But I'm practicing the art I can do in Matsuba.

286
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:47,114
I got injured and got in a wheelchair.

287
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:52,114
If I had to force myself to get in a wheelchair,

288
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:54,114
I'd be a first-class civil servant.

289
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:55,114
Seriously?

290
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:57,114
That's how it is, Japanese.

291
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,114
I'll remember that.

292
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:02,114
How are you doing lately?

293
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:06,114
I don't know.

294
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:10,114
I got fired from my part-time job.

295
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:13,114
Oh, and I'm a three-month pensioner.

296
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:16,114
You're still a jerk.

297
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:17,114
Yeah.

298
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:19,114
How about practice?

299
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:20,114
That's fine.

300
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:21,114
Good.

301
00:23:21,114 --> 00:23:23,114
I'm not good at this.

302
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:26,114
I want to be like Kotaro.

303
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,114
You have to keep going.

304
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:31,114
If you give up, that's the end of it.

305
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:32,114
Yes.

306
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:34,114
Shinji.

307
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:35,114
Yes?

308
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,114
Can I borrow some money?

309
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:38,114
Yes?

310
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:41,114
Did you hear what Kotaro just said?

311
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:43,114
I was just kidding.

312
00:23:45,114 --> 00:23:46,442
What the hell?

313
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:50,538
Welcome.

314
00:23:52,538 --> 00:23:54,538
Sorry for being late.

315
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:55,538
I'm Kanuro.

316
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:58,538
I'm Yuriko Shika. Nice to meet you.

317
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,538
You're more beautiful than I thought.

318
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:02,538
Cheers.

319
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:05,538
Nice to meet you.

320
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:07,538
Nice to meet you too.

321
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:08,538
I'm asking you out of the blue.

322
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:09,538
Can I borrow some money?

323
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,538
You're a senior.

324
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:14,538
Let me go.

325
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:15,538
What's that?

326
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:16,538
Gin Tonic.

327
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,538
Gin Tonic?

328
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:18,538
Yes.

329
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:20,538
I got a new one.

330
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:21,538
I got a new one.

331
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:22,538
I'm going to get it.

332
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:23,538
I'm going to get it.

333
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:26,538
Kotaro, you're late.

334
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:29,538
I'm not injured.

335
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:30,538
Hey.

336
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:31,538
Hey.

337
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:33,538
What's wrong with you?

338
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:35,538
It's none of your business.

339
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:37,538
You're lying.

340
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:39,538
It's none of your business.

341
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:41,538
I see.

342
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:43,538
I'm glad.

343
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:48,538
Nice.

344
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:49,538
Nice.

345
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:50,538
Nice.

346
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:58,538
By the way, the contest for photo magazines that I published the other day has been cancelled.

347
00:25:58,538 --> 00:25:59,538
I see.

348
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:00,538
Yeah.

349
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:02,538
Next time.

350
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:06,538
I see.

351
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:10,538
But you're still a coward.

352
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:14,538
You'll get stronger over and over again.

353
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:15,538
Right?

354
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,538
I know.

355
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:22,538
It's kind of cold today.

356
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,130
Hey!

357
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,130
Are you okay?

358
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,410
It'll get warmer soon.

359
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,610
I'm scared if Shinji's not here.

360
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,410
What do you mean?

361
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,410
It'll get colder if you're alone.

362
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:25,090
I wonder if I can come back here again.

363
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:29,290
You'll be fine, Yuriko.

364
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,290
You'll be fine.

365
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,826
I hope so.

366
00:31:57,234 --> 00:32:02,586
When you're done, check and refill the water.

367
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:03,586
Okay.

368
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:06,586
Don't eat too much of the washing.

369
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:08,586
Okay.

370
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:11,586
You've been waiting for so long for a part-time job.

371
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:15,586
You only put me in the right spots.

372
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:19,586
To feed him who has no income.

373
00:32:19,586 --> 00:32:23,586
Do I look like a person who likes to eat?

374
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:27,586
I wonder.

375
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:31,586
I'm a private store.

376
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,586
A private store?

377
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:36,594
I want to open a photo store.

378
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:39,594
Oh, I see.

379
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:42,594
Yuri-chan is a real-time cameraman.

380
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,594
I mean, he's still an assistant.

381
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:50,946
I envy people who have dreams.

382
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:54,946
I don't have anything I want to do.

383
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:56,946
I think I'm just a man.

384
00:32:56,946 --> 00:32:58,946
I'm just a man.

385
00:32:58,946 --> 00:33:00,946
Are you?

386
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,946
Men are idiots.

387
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:05,946
It's fun to bully.

388
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:08,946
Miho-san is amazing.

389
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:18,302
It's not good to drink in the morning.

390
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:21,802
Today is a holiday.

391
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:24,802
Yesterday was the day before.

392
00:33:26,302 --> 00:33:27,802
Is that so?

393
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:33,142
Hey, are you practicing properly?

394
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:35,142
I am.

395
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:37,142
While drinking?

396
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,142
It stinks.

397
00:33:49,722 --> 00:33:54,722
Hey, if you keep drinking like that, you'll become a tourist and become a beggar.

398
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:57,890
It's okay.

399
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:03,482
My father was like that, too.

400
00:34:04,982 --> 00:34:06,482
I'll give you a light.

401
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:17,826
What?

402
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:18,826
Nothing.

403
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:12,154
Please look forward to tomorrow!

404
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:14,154
See you again!

405
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,154
Thank you!

406
00:35:16,154 --> 00:35:18,154
Thank you!

407
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:20,154
Thank you!

408
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:25,138
What's wrong?

409
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:27,558
Gag!

410
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,330
Hey.

411
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,698
Are you serious?

412
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:49,238
I thought I'd get hurt this time.

413
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:51,738
I'll be a real man for a year,

414
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:54,738
and I'll have to fight big here.

415
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:55,938
No.

416
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:57,938
You're so cool.

417
00:35:58,138 --> 00:35:59,138
Right?

418
00:35:59,138 --> 00:36:00,138
I'm proud of you.

419
00:36:01,238 --> 00:36:02,238
But...

420
00:36:02,738 --> 00:36:05,138
I'm in trouble.

421
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:07,738
I don't have enough money.

422
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:10,646
You're here again.

423
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,446
No, I'm serious this time.

424
00:36:12,446 --> 00:36:13,446
What's wrong?

425
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:15,746
That's right.

426
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:19,746
I've collected 100 yen at the ryokan.

427
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:23,046
But I can't contact the person who will give me 50 yen.

428
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:25,446
If you have 50 yen, you can pay me.

429
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:28,446
He's still a minor.

430
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:30,846
I've been through a lot,

431
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:33,246
but he's cold.

432
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:35,246
I can't rely on anyone else.

433
00:36:36,646 --> 00:36:37,846
Only you.

434
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:40,446
There's no way.

435
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:41,646
I don't have that kind of money.

436
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:44,246
I'll ask for it.

437
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:49,514
No, no.

438
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:51,314
I can't.

439
00:36:51,914 --> 00:36:55,114
I'm almost like a friend to her.

440
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:56,714
Please.

441
00:36:58,014 --> 00:36:59,014
My dream.

442
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:01,114
Please.

443
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:02,814
Please.

444
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:03,914
I can't.

445
00:37:04,114 --> 00:37:05,514
I can't do it.

446
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:06,614
Please.

447
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:08,814
Please sit down.

448
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:42,518
I'm not doing anything.

449
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:50,518
Hey, it's weird that you want to do something for people when you're not doing anything.

450
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,518
Please.

451
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:55,518
I can't do it.

452
00:37:55,518 --> 00:38:04,054
If my friends are active, it will be a stimulus for me.

453
00:38:04,054 --> 00:38:12,246
To be honest, I've been feeling down lately.

454
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:20,246
But when I heard about Kotaro, I thought I had to do it properly.

455
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:53,258
I was surprised.

456
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:06,290
It's okay. I've never been lied to by that person.

457
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,290
Then it's okay.

458
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,618
Do you want to go for a drink?

459
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:14,618
No.

460
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:20,258
What's wrong with you?

461
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:22,258
Come on.

462
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:25,258
Hello.

463
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:28,778
Are you really angry?

464
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,706
Let's go!

465
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:40,162
What are you doing? I'm going!

466
00:39:40,162 --> 00:39:42,162
Hey!

467
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:44,714
Come here!

468
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,714
Hey!

469
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:48,714
I said stop!

470
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:52,714
Come here!

471
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:54,714
I said stop!

472
00:39:54,714 --> 00:39:56,714
I'm going!

473
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:03,082
Let's go!

474
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,698
One more time!

475
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,770
You're getting taller and taller!

476
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:19,738
I didn't see anything.

477
00:40:19,738 --> 00:40:21,738
It's boring!

478
00:40:21,738 --> 00:40:23,738
Study more!

479
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:29,738
Study! Study! Study! Study! Study! Study!

480
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:47,366
Hi!

481
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:56,098
Hey, Shin-chan.

482
00:40:56,098 --> 00:40:57,098
What's up?

483
00:40:57,098 --> 00:40:58,098
What's up?

484
00:40:58,098 --> 00:40:59,458
Good work.

485
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,458
Oh, Shin-chan.

486
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,458
Good work.

487
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,458
What was it like today?

488
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,458
Not good.

489
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,458
Shin-chan.

490
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:06,458
What?

491
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,458
What?

492
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:08,458
I don't know.

493
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,458
I asked Kotaro-san for some money.

494
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:10,458
What?

495
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:14,458
I heard that he stole money from everywhere and flew away.

496
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,458
He's a man of honor, right?

497
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:17,458
That's not true.

498
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:20,042
What do you mean, a man of honor?

499
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,042
He's got tickets, too.

500
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:22,042
What?

501
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:26,042
I asked Kotaro-san for some money, too.

502
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:29,042
And he never gets any money.

503
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:31,042
When did you contact Shin-chan recently?

504
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:32,042
I don't know.

505
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:35,466
I don't think I've talked to him lately.

506
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:36,466
I don't know.

507
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:37,466
I don't know.

508
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:38,466
I don't know.

509
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:39,466
I don't know.

510
00:41:39,466 --> 00:41:40,486
I don't know.

511
00:41:43,674 --> 00:41:47,514
I wonder if it's hard to connect because I'm overseas.

512
00:41:47,514 --> 00:41:50,534
When is it?

513
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,970
It's hard for both of us, but let's do our best.

514
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,730
Cheers!

515
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,730
Welcome.

516
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,730
What's wrong?

517
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,730
I came to see how you're doing.

518
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,730
I have to contribute to the sales.

519
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,870
I went to the store today.

520
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,810
There's nothing to do before contributing to the sales.

521
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,190
It's fine.

522
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,190
It's not good.

523
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,190
Kiyo-san, gin tonic.

524
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,190
Yeah!

525
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,490
It's fine.

526
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,394
I'm sure you're drinking at a store where a lot of people work.

527
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:39,394
Who paid for this month's rent?

528
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:43,394
If you have time to do useless things like Daidouge,

529
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,394
work hard and pay me back my money.

530
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:48,894
What?

531
00:42:50,394 --> 00:42:52,394
Give it back.

532
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:15,102
Chihagengka is the best!

533
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:16,302
Hehehe

534
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,002
Yes

535
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:23,530
Do you know that the electricity bill for the time zone at midnight is cheap?

536
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,730
Yes

537
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,330
Yes

538
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:29,830
In short, the idea is to store the cheap time zone electricity in a built-in battery

539
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:33,630
and use it during the day

540
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,630
Yes

541
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,230
Yes

542
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,630
Sunlight panel

543
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,402
Sunlight panel is...

544
00:43:43,402 --> 00:43:45,402
Please wait a moment

545
00:43:45,402 --> 00:43:47,202
Cute

546
00:43:47,202 --> 00:43:48,502
Oh, sorry, I want you to go

547
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:52,502
Catch it, catch it

548
00:43:52,502 --> 00:43:53,202
It's silver

549
00:43:53,202 --> 00:43:54,002
Yes

550
00:43:54,002 --> 00:43:56,002
Oh, sorry

551
00:43:56,002 --> 00:43:57,402
This is the price

552
00:43:57,402 --> 00:44:00,178
Yes

553
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:02,078
Oh, it's beautiful

554
00:44:02,078 --> 00:44:02,878
Really?

555
00:44:02,878 --> 00:44:03,978
Yes

556
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:05,178
Beautiful

557
00:44:05,178 --> 00:44:07,878
Then, can you remove the button little by little?

558
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:08,978
Yes

559
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:10,778
Yes, yes, yes

560
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:12,278
Little by little

561
00:44:12,278 --> 00:44:12,978
Oh, nice

562
00:44:12,978 --> 00:44:14,078
The collarbone is beautiful

563
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:15,078
Really?

564
00:44:15,078 --> 00:44:15,578
Yes

565
00:44:15,578 --> 00:44:16,078
Nice

566
00:44:16,078 --> 00:44:18,078
Oh, cute

567
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:20,078
Cute, cute, cute

568
00:44:26,938 --> 00:44:27,738
Hey.

569
00:44:27,738 --> 00:44:28,938
Yes?

570
00:44:28,938 --> 00:44:30,538
The last girl today...

571
00:44:30,538 --> 00:44:31,438
Yes?

572
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:33,038
Was she okay?

573
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,738
Yes, she was.

574
00:44:36,238 --> 00:44:39,906
She said she's going to have surgery next time.

575
00:44:41,406 --> 00:44:46,374
And she sent me an email saying she wanted to leave a clean body before the wound.

576
00:44:48,174 --> 00:44:51,650
It depends on the person, but...

577
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,950
Well...

578
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,850
It's more fun than having a model who doesn't get along with you.

579
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,750
Yes.

580
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,150
Well...

581
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,050
I changed my mind after seeing her in person.

582
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,550
I'm glad.

583
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,950
You want to have a shot too?

584
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,350
I don't have a body that I want to remember.

585
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,950
Don't say that again.

586
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,750
No, really.

587
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,750
You should have taken it when you were young.

588
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,750
No, it's okay.

589
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:24,850
It's okay.

590
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,550
I said it's okay.

591
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,250
I won't call you again.

592
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,350
Okay.

593
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:31,050
I got it.

594
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,550
Bye-bye.

595
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,850
Idiot.

596
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,190
Idiot!

597
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:45,730
Yo.

598
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:51,234
You're not used to the suit.

599
00:45:52,734 --> 00:45:54,602
I've always been free.

600
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:56,802
How's Yuri?

601
00:45:56,902 --> 00:45:58,302
She's busy lately.

602
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:00,402
She doesn't come to the store.

603
00:46:00,502 --> 00:46:02,802
I don't know, but I guess so.

604
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,802
She's late for work.

605
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:07,802
What about the Daido game?

606
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:10,902
I'm taking a break.

607
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:14,402
It's none of your business.

608
00:46:16,602 --> 00:46:19,602
You look like you're bored.

609
00:46:21,602 --> 00:46:24,602
Isn't there anything interesting?

610
00:46:26,102 --> 00:46:29,250
You want to have sex with me?

611
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,962
Is that interesting?

612
00:46:36,758 --> 00:46:39,258
I don't know.

613
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:45,282
Are you sure?

614
00:46:46,782 --> 00:46:49,834
I just wanted to do it.

615
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,450
Anyone is fine.

616
00:47:23,578 --> 00:47:26,578
If it's a human being, then it's a human being.

617
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:30,314
What are you doing?

618
00:47:31,314 --> 00:47:32,314
It's hot.

619
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:34,314
It's hot.

620
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:36,314
Ouch!

621
00:47:43,738 --> 00:47:49,758
cute

622
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:07,338
Tada!

623
00:48:19,098 --> 00:48:21,098
Miho-san, are you okay?

624
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,098
Yeah.

625
00:48:26,098 --> 00:48:29,322
It's painful.

626
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:45,162
I'm going.

627
00:50:53,722 --> 00:50:55,722
I'm so nervous.

628
00:51:04,882 --> 00:51:06,322
Are you nervous?

629
00:51:06,322 --> 00:51:08,322
Just a little bit.

630
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:12,742
At first, everyone is very nervous, but please relax.

631
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:14,742
Relax your shoulders.

632
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,742
I'm going to take a picture.

633
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:18,742
How long have you been doing this?

634
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,742
8 months.

635
00:51:20,742 --> 00:51:22,742
Are you a boy or a girl?

636
00:51:22,742 --> 00:51:24,742
I'm a boy.

637
00:51:24,742 --> 00:51:27,262
Really?

638
00:51:27,262 --> 00:51:29,262
You're younger than me.

639
00:51:29,262 --> 00:51:33,958
I'm a little nervous.

640
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,958
I'm nervous.

641
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,958
I'm nervous.

642
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:39,958
I'm nervous.

643
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,958
I'm nervous.

644
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,958
I'm nervous.

645
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:45,958
I'm nervous.

646
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,958
I'm nervous.

647
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,958
You're a little nervous.

648
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:51,958
I'm not nervous.

649
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,958
I'm nervous.

650
00:51:56,222 --> 00:51:58,222
I'm nervous.

651
00:51:58,222 --> 00:52:00,222
I'm nervous.

652
00:52:00,222 --> 00:52:02,222
I'm nervous.

653
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:04,222
I'm nervous.

654
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:06,222
Are you a boyfriend?

655
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:08,222
I just took a picture.

656
00:52:08,222 --> 00:52:10,222
Well,

657
00:52:10,222 --> 00:52:12,222
I have a boyfriend,

658
00:52:14,222 --> 00:52:18,246
but I don't know much about him.

659
00:52:20,246 --> 00:52:26,246
Next, please lean on the corner of the floor.

660
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:27,246
Are you okay?

661
00:52:27,246 --> 00:52:28,246
Are you okay?

662
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:34,630
Good job.

663
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,630
Thank you for your hard work.

664
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,630
I'll go ahead and wash the dishes today.

665
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:39,630
Yes.

666
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,630
How is it?

667
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,630
Perfect.

668
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,630
Perfect?

669
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,630
Perfect.

670
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,630
Are you doing well?

671
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,630
I'm doing well.

672
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,630
Okay, I'll do my best.

673
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:51,630
Please enjoy it.

674
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,630
Oh, that's right.

675
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,630
Please enjoy it.

676
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,630
Please enjoy it.

677
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,630
Thank you for your hard work.

678
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,630
Thank you for your hard work.

679
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,630
Have a nice day.

680
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:58,630
I'll go.

681
00:53:11,962 --> 00:53:13,862
I forgot something!

682
00:53:20,602 --> 00:53:23,314
Wait a minute!

683
00:53:23,314 --> 00:53:25,738
Not there! Not there!

684
00:53:25,738 --> 00:53:27,738
Toilet! Toilet!

685
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,738
Come on!

686
00:53:29,738 --> 00:53:32,006
This way! This way!

687
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:37,482
What's this?

688
00:53:59,322 --> 00:54:02,022
I told you not to contact me anymore.

689
00:54:03,222 --> 00:54:03,922
No.

690
00:54:05,562 --> 00:54:07,862
I heard you were with Aika.

691
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:10,962
I thought I'd say hello.

692
00:54:15,678 --> 00:54:17,978
Joe and I have nothing to do with each other.

693
00:54:18,078 --> 00:54:20,478
We're still students.

694
00:54:20,778 --> 00:54:21,578
And...

695
00:54:24,478 --> 00:54:26,578
She's my ex-girlfriend.

696
00:54:27,178 --> 00:54:28,178
I heard that.

697
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:30,678
You're not good at business.

698
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,130
Yuriko!

699
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:51,130
Oh, please go home.

700
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,610
I saw your photo in the office.

701
00:54:58,682 --> 00:55:00,682
You have a good sense.

702
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:07,170
But you said you were an assistant again.

703
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:12,266
You're a cameraman.

704
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:15,266
What's wrong with you?

705
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:19,266
Just take it.

706
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:23,370
That's what it means to be a professional.

707
00:55:26,298 --> 00:55:28,298
Don't say that.

708
00:55:34,682 --> 00:55:36,682
I'm retiring.

709
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:43,466
The model I was looking for...

710
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,466
...has been exposed on Twitter.

711
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:50,466
She's ruined my job.

712
00:55:53,506 --> 00:55:56,962
I'll be on the news tomorrow.

713
00:56:00,994 --> 00:56:01,994
Seriously.

714
00:56:06,874 --> 00:56:09,874
But that's how it is.

715
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:54,430
I know I wanted a chance to sleep with you.

716
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,430
But I couldn't help it.

717
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:01,430
I know everything about you.

718
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,430
No, you don't.

719
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:11,742
But I learned something.

720
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:17,454
You told me that you couldn't depend on anyone to make your dream come true.

721
00:57:17,454 --> 00:57:21,454
You told me that you had no choice but to do it yourself.

722
00:57:21,454 --> 00:57:24,654
What a boring woman.

723
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:30,742
I'm cold.

724
00:57:39,194 --> 00:57:41,194
Don't come to see me again.

725
00:57:42,434 --> 00:57:45,666
I've decided not to come back.

726
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:48,898
I see.

727
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:53,618
You'll do your best.

728
00:57:57,978 --> 00:58:00,978
I loved your hand.

729
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,594
It was thin, soft, and smooth.

730
00:58:06,594 --> 00:58:10,210
I loved it the most in the world.

731
00:58:13,882 --> 00:58:15,882
Wait, what?

732
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:18,590
Sorry.

733
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:21,890
Well,

734
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,742
I won't see you again.

735
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:44,170
Here you go.

736
00:58:46,178 --> 00:58:47,178
Is this your first time?

737
00:58:48,178 --> 00:58:50,178
Yes, I don't know anything.

738
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:54,178
You're so close.

739
00:58:55,178 --> 00:58:57,178
I'm embarrassed.

740
00:58:58,178 --> 00:59:00,178
I have a budget for the photo exhibition I recently did.

741
00:59:01,178 --> 00:59:02,178
I'll bring it.

742
00:59:02,178 --> 00:59:03,178
Please wait.

743
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:10,378
Please open it.

744
00:59:10,378 --> 00:59:12,378
Thank you.

745
00:59:20,442 --> 00:59:22,442
I hope it goes well.

746
00:59:23,578 --> 00:59:25,578
Thank you very much.

747
00:59:26,578 --> 00:59:28,578
I'm getting healthier.

748
00:59:29,578 --> 00:59:32,578
I think I can study a little.

749
00:59:33,578 --> 00:59:36,322
You're a beauty major, right?

750
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:38,746
I'm a beauty major.

751
00:59:38,746 --> 00:59:40,746
Why did you know?

752
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:42,746
Me too.

753
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,746
I'm so happy.

754
00:59:53,274 --> 00:59:54,654
You're going to get into the budget?

755
00:59:57,114 --> 00:59:58,614
I'll see about that.

756
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:02,654
But I have so much to do that I'm going to puke.

757
01:00:10,426 --> 01:00:12,426
How is this?

758
01:00:16,826 --> 01:00:18,826
Isn't it good?

759
01:00:18,826 --> 01:00:20,826
Yuriko is a genius!

760
01:00:28,282 --> 01:00:30,282
How about you, Shinji?

761
01:00:30,282 --> 01:00:32,282
What?

762
01:00:32,282 --> 01:00:35,282
You did the Daidogei for the first time in a while, right?

763
01:00:35,282 --> 01:00:37,282
How was it?

764
01:00:38,282 --> 01:00:42,282
It was nothing compared to the practice.

765
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:51,082
You don't have to pay me back.

766
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,082
I'll take care of it myself.

767
01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:56,082
I'll pay you back.

768
01:00:57,082 --> 01:00:59,082
I'll pay you back no matter what.

769
01:01:00,082 --> 01:01:02,338
Really?

770
01:01:09,338 --> 01:01:12,038
It's been a while. You must be busy.

771
01:01:13,638 --> 01:01:17,738
I asked you to come, but I'm sorry I can only work three times.

772
01:01:17,738 --> 01:01:19,138
No problem.

773
01:01:19,138 --> 01:01:21,178
I'm free anyway.

774
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:22,678
I'll drink sometimes.

775
01:01:24,486 --> 01:01:26,486
Then, would you like a beer?

776
01:01:26,486 --> 01:01:27,286
Sure.

777
01:01:29,346 --> 01:01:30,406
Kiri-chan.

778
01:01:30,406 --> 01:01:31,146
Yes?

779
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,906
I'm with Shinji.

780
01:01:33,986 --> 01:01:35,646
With what?

781
01:01:35,646 --> 01:01:36,946
Sex.

782
01:01:40,026 --> 01:01:43,906
You're so bad at this.

783
01:01:43,906 --> 01:01:45,906
You should train more.

784
01:01:53,562 --> 01:01:58,562
What? Are you mad?

785
01:01:58,562 --> 01:02:00,562
What?

786
01:02:00,562 --> 01:02:03,562
You're sleeping too.

787
01:02:03,562 --> 01:02:06,562
With another man.

788
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:10,562
You're not sleeping!

789
01:02:12,794 --> 01:02:14,794
See you later.

790
01:02:31,994 --> 01:02:33,994
One, two, three.

791
01:02:33,994 --> 01:02:36,130
I did it!

792
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:38,130
What the hell is this?

793
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,682
I didn't do it.

794
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,210
It's cold.

795
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,338
Were you awake? What about work?

796
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:34,730
I'm off.

797
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:37,430
Where were you?

798
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,018
At the hotel.

799
01:03:46,638 --> 01:03:48,238
You want me to pay for the power?

800
01:03:49,638 --> 01:03:50,638
What if I did?

801
01:03:52,758 --> 01:03:54,358
What if I did?

802
01:04:20,154 --> 01:04:24,402
I'm sorry.

803
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:43,258
I'm a fool, a lazy person, I drink a lot, I have no money, I'm not good.

804
01:04:45,386 --> 01:04:47,386
Yeah, that's right.

805
01:04:47,386 --> 01:04:54,386
I know! I know, but I can't help it.

806
01:05:09,626 --> 01:05:10,626
What is this?

807
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,226
I don't want to borrow it.

808
01:05:13,586 --> 01:05:14,586
It's fine.

809
01:05:15,966 --> 01:05:17,326
I'll return it.

810
01:05:18,646 --> 01:05:22,470
Let's break up.

811
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,250
Us two.

812
01:05:36,122 --> 01:05:38,122
What's wrong with this money?

813
01:05:39,122 --> 01:05:41,866
It's my work money.

814
01:05:41,866 --> 01:05:45,562
Are you serious?

815
01:05:48,274 --> 01:05:50,274
I'm having a hard time with you.

816
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:56,698
You're working hard for your dream, but I'm not working hard at all.

817
01:05:59,282 --> 01:06:02,282
You have talent, but I don't have any.

818
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:08,850
Stop playing the big game.

819
01:06:11,562 --> 01:06:13,562
I'm the same as Kotaro.

820
01:06:14,562 --> 01:06:17,562
I may have been looking for an opportunity to escape.

821
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:25,970
I'm just doing what I do now.

822
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:28,970
I wonder if it suits me.

823
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,970
I'm so happy to be full every day.

824
01:06:39,546 --> 01:06:41,546
Is that okay?

825
01:06:44,282 --> 01:06:46,282
No.

826
01:06:53,978 --> 01:06:56,478
Are you going to hang out with Miho next time?

827
01:06:57,978 --> 01:06:59,882
No way.

828
01:07:02,326 --> 01:07:05,126
That's the only way you can do it, right?

829
01:07:05,126 --> 01:07:08,126
What kind of a person are you? You're making me mad!

830
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:10,626
Let's break up.

831
01:07:11,426 --> 01:07:13,426
I don't mean to be in a relationship.

832
01:07:18,426 --> 01:07:23,426
Well then, I'll get rid of the dandruff.

833
01:07:41,466 --> 01:07:42,466
Yuriko!

834
01:07:42,466 --> 01:07:43,466
Yes!

835
01:07:44,466 --> 01:07:47,690
I have a question.

836
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:48,690
What should I do?

837
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,690
Well...

838
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:53,690
The place is fine here, but...

839
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:56,690
The flowers are on the right side.

840
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:57,690
Please.

841
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:02,690
Do you need help?

842
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:04,690
No, no, it's okay.

843
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,690
Don't worry.

844
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:06,690
It's okay.

845
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:07,690
There's a light around here.

846
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,690
You can't touch the photos.

847
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:11,690
I'll bring Ame-chan.

848
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:14,690
Thank you.

849
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,690
You're so nice.

850
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:17,690
Yes.

851
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:20,690
Thank you.

852
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:39,154
I managed to make it somehow.

853
01:08:39,154 --> 01:08:40,154
Yes.

854
01:08:40,154 --> 01:08:42,154
Thank you very much. You have helped me.

855
01:08:43,154 --> 01:08:44,154
Here too.

856
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,154
Yes.

857
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:46,154
Thank you very much.

858
01:08:46,154 --> 01:08:47,154
Thank you very much.

859
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:50,154
I did my best to help you.

860
01:08:50,154 --> 01:08:51,154
Thank you very much.

861
01:08:51,154 --> 01:08:52,154
Thank you very much.

862
01:08:57,154 --> 01:09:00,154
Finally, it has become in shape.

863
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:03,290
What?

864
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:08,602
Please give this to Shinji.

865
01:09:11,602 --> 01:09:12,602
Yes.

866
01:09:13,602 --> 01:09:14,602
See you.

867
01:09:18,794 --> 01:09:24,050
Yuriko Shika's photo exhibition.

868
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,090
It's boring.

869
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:40,322
Do you like it?

870
01:09:40,322 --> 01:09:45,322
I thought the title and the pictures were perfect.

871
01:09:45,322 --> 01:09:47,322
Thank you.

872
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,490
Baba-kun!

873
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,490
Can you do the overtime for me?

874
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:01,290
You said you'd be early today.

875
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,490
Really?

876
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,490
But if you go home, no one else will be here.

877
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:06,490
But...

878
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,790
I'll leave it to you for 30 minutes.

879
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:13,302
As you say.

880
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:15,302
Yes.

881
01:10:16,002 --> 01:10:17,002
I'm sorry.

882
01:10:18,838 --> 01:10:20,538
I'm not being stupid.

883
01:10:21,438 --> 01:10:22,138
Yes.

884
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:25,850
I'm sorry.

885
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:27,750
I'm sorry.

886
01:10:42,106 --> 01:10:46,570
Sorry, I have 30 minutes left.

887
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:48,870
The next person is late.

888
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,470
I don't have time. I can't go on.

889
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,870
I told you at the beginning.

890
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,570
There's a overtime here.

891
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:55,670
But today...

892
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:57,170
Oh, right.

893
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,670
Then you can go home.

894
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,470
You don't have to come back.

895
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:04,134
I'm fired.

896
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:09,134
It's natural that you're going home.

897
01:11:12,506 --> 01:11:15,506
You're such an idiot!

898
01:11:18,922 --> 01:11:22,922
I'm going to end this boring lecture!

899
01:11:22,922 --> 01:11:24,922
It's over!

900
01:11:24,922 --> 01:11:25,922
It's over!

901
01:11:25,922 --> 01:11:27,922
Don't you dare take a picture of me!

902
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:29,922
Don't you dare do that, you bastard!

903
01:11:29,922 --> 01:11:30,922
What are you doing?

904
01:11:30,922 --> 01:11:32,922
I'm going to take a picture of you!

905
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:34,922
Shut up!

906
01:11:34,922 --> 01:11:35,922
Shut up!

907
01:11:40,522 --> 01:11:42,522
Thank you very much.

908
01:11:43,522 --> 01:11:48,314
Thank you very much.

909
01:11:49,314 --> 01:11:50,374
Thank you very much.

910
01:12:08,442 --> 01:12:10,442
You're a boyfriend of a woman.

911
01:12:11,442 --> 01:12:13,442
You're not a man.

912
01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:14,442
You're a man.

913
01:12:14,442 --> 01:12:15,442
You're a man.

914
01:12:15,442 --> 01:12:16,442
You're a man.

915
01:12:16,442 --> 01:12:17,442
What?

916
01:12:19,442 --> 01:12:21,378
It's okay.

917
01:12:42,106 --> 01:12:45,106
Your boyfriend didn't come, did he?

918
01:12:47,106 --> 01:12:49,106
Well, that's fine.

919
01:13:14,778 --> 01:13:16,018
I'm sorry.

920
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:27,306
2 hours late

921
01:13:27,306 --> 01:13:28,606
5 minutes?

922
01:13:28,606 --> 01:13:31,306
I was waiting

923
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:36,146
I felt like Shinji would come

924
01:13:40,538 --> 01:13:42,538
Wait, wait!

925
01:13:44,538 --> 01:13:45,538
Wait!

926
01:13:46,538 --> 01:13:47,538
I broke up with Miho.

927
01:13:48,538 --> 01:13:51,538
I want to apologize to her.

928
01:13:54,538 --> 01:13:57,538
You're a little bit disturbed.

929
01:13:58,538 --> 01:14:00,538
Calm down.

930
01:14:01,538 --> 01:14:02,538
I understand.

931
01:14:06,538 --> 01:14:08,538
Thank you.

932
01:14:09,538 --> 01:14:11,538
This is the one I took.

933
01:14:12,538 --> 01:14:14,994
I put them together.

934
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,450
It's nice.

935
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,746
I miss the past.

936
01:14:23,746 --> 01:14:26,746
I feel like it's a long time ago.

937
01:14:34,586 --> 01:14:41,986
You know, I've decided something while I was running to the venue.

938
01:14:41,986 --> 01:14:44,750
What?

939
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:48,250
What if I meet Yuriko?

940
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,850
What if you meet her?

941
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:58,798
I want to try Daido-ge again.

942
01:14:58,798 --> 01:15:04,510
See, Kotaro-san. He left saying he was going to Ejinbara.

943
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:11,850
Then I'll follow Kotaro-san's lead and do some overseas training.

944
01:15:15,186 --> 01:15:16,786
That's good.

945
01:15:16,786 --> 01:15:18,586
That's really good.

946
01:15:18,586 --> 01:15:21,586
That's really good.

947
01:15:25,434 --> 01:15:26,434
What?

948
01:15:26,934 --> 01:15:28,934
I don't know, but I'm so happy.

949
01:15:31,062 --> 01:15:32,562
Ororon.

950
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:37,070
I don't know how many years it'll take,

951
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:39,370
but I...

952
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,878
I...

953
01:15:44,926 --> 01:15:48,726
I have to do my best for her.

954
01:15:49,826 --> 01:15:51,026
Ororon.

955
01:15:52,726 --> 01:15:56,518
Why are you crying?

956
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:57,918
I don't know.

957
01:15:58,418 --> 01:15:59,418
I don't know.

958
01:16:20,794 --> 01:16:28,294
I can't do this.

959
01:16:28,294 --> 01:16:32,026
It's not a bad idea.

960
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:33,526
It's not a good idea.

961
01:16:33,526 --> 01:16:36,026
You're not a bad idea.

962
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,210
Kotaro?

963
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,250
Hey!

964
01:17:14,146 --> 01:17:17,646
You idiot! You're gonna get a bone marrow again!

965
01:17:17,646 --> 01:17:19,146
What are you doing?

966
01:17:19,146 --> 01:17:20,646
We were worried about you!

967
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:45,294
I really wanted to go.

968
01:17:48,778 --> 01:17:56,218
But before I left, Tamaki took money and a ticket and went somewhere.

969
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:59,218
I'm a victim too.

970
01:18:04,242 --> 01:18:05,542
I can't help it.

971
01:18:06,542 --> 01:18:10,142
If I always seem to be doing well, I'm always in the way of someone.

972
01:18:19,922 --> 01:18:25,422
And she went with the real Kotaro.

973
01:18:25,422 --> 01:18:26,922
To Ejinbara.

974
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:30,090
What are you talking about?

975
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:34,090
By the way...

976
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,090
Who are you?

977
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:41,090
You're Kotaro's fake.

978
01:18:48,154 --> 01:18:56,394
The real Kotaro is not a lame man like this.

979
01:20:04,858 --> 01:20:07,858
Did you live around here before?

980
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:11,358
Yes, it's been five years.

981
01:20:11,858 --> 01:20:14,358
I'm a bad boyfriend from Daidougei.

982
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:17,858
This town hurts!

983
01:20:19,658 --> 01:20:21,858
What's he doing?

984
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:24,858
Is he still working overseas?

985
01:20:27,358 --> 01:20:29,398
Well...

986
01:20:29,398 --> 01:20:33,398
He's definitely drinking again today.

987
01:20:34,398 --> 01:20:36,398
He's definitely drinking again.

988
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,398
He's the worst.

989
01:20:39,398 --> 01:20:41,398
He's really the worst.

990
01:20:42,398 --> 01:20:47,158
I'll take a picture.

991
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:49,158
Please.

992
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:54,166
Tera-chan, you look so cool.

993
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:56,166
Thank you.

994
01:20:56,166 --> 01:20:58,166
You've been a really good man since before.

995
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:00,166
I did it.

996
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:02,166
Try to pull that.

997
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:04,166
Here I go.

998
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:06,166
I feel like Hawaii.

999
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:10,166
Tera-chan, can you run like a monkey?

1000
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:12,166
What's that?

1001
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,166
Just run.

1002
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:15,166
I can't.

1003
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:17,166
I'm not saying you can't.

1004
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:20,166
Just try to your limit.

1005
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:22,166
I'll try.

1006
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:26,166
You used to be such a crazy person.

1007
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:28,166
Here I go.

1008
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:29,166
Please.

1009
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:31,166
It's good.

1010
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:33,166
I'm a real man.

1011
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:35,166
You did a great job today.

1012
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,166
Really?

1013
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:37,166
You're the best.

1014
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:39,166
Please sit down.

1015
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:40,166
Okay.

1016
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:41,166
I'll start from the side.

1017
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,166
You're a real man.

1018
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:44,166
You're a good man.

1019
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:46,166
Be confident.

1020
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:49,166
You did a monkey.

1021
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:50,166
You did a monkey.

1022
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:51,166
You did a good job.

1023
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:52,166
You're a good rider.

1024
01:22:14,714 --> 01:22:17,414
There was a person who was shooting a big mountain pass over there.

1025
01:22:17,414 --> 01:22:19,234
It's a foreign country.

1026
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:20,134
Really?

1027
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:21,214
Are you going to see it?

1028
01:22:22,954 --> 01:22:24,274
The sun is setting.

1029
01:22:24,274 --> 01:22:25,174
Work, work!

1030
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:26,314
Yes.

1031
01:22:27,654 --> 01:22:30,446
I wanted to go see it.

1032
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:31,846
There was Hawaii.

1033
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,846
There is no way!

1034
01:22:33,846 --> 01:22:35,846
Let's go.

1035
01:22:39,846 --> 01:22:40,846
I will go!

1036
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:43,246
I will go!

1037
01:22:43,246 --> 01:22:43,846
I can go!

1038
01:22:43,846 --> 01:22:44,646
Good luck!

1039
01:22:44,646 --> 01:22:46,646
Good luck!

1040
01:22:46,646 --> 01:22:48,646
This is a mess.

1041
01:22:48,646 --> 01:22:50,646
It's really dangerous.

1042
01:22:50,646 --> 01:22:52,646
It's dangerous to talk.

1043
01:22:52,646 --> 01:22:54,646
Applause!

1044
01:22:54,646 --> 01:22:56,646
Applause!

1045
01:22:56,646 --> 01:22:58,646
Applause!

1046
01:22:58,646 --> 01:23:00,646
Applause!

1047
01:23:02,646 --> 01:23:04,646
It's hard to get off.

1048
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:08,646
Yes!

1049
01:23:08,646 --> 01:23:10,646
Yes!

1050
01:23:10,646 --> 01:23:13,262
Until the end!

1051
01:23:13,262 --> 01:23:15,262
It's really a mess.

1052
01:23:17,262 --> 01:23:19,262
I want you to be satisfied and go home.

1053
01:23:19,262 --> 01:23:23,262
I will turn more than usual.

1054
01:23:23,262 --> 01:23:25,262
I will go!

1055
01:23:25,262 --> 01:23:26,262
Yes!

1056
01:23:26,262 --> 01:23:27,262
3

1057
01:23:27,262 --> 01:23:28,262
2

1058
01:23:28,262 --> 01:23:29,262
1

1059
01:23:29,262 --> 01:23:30,262
Yes!

1060
01:23:30,262 --> 01:23:32,262
Yes!

1061
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:35,262
I did it!

1062
01:23:35,262 --> 01:23:37,302
What?

1063
01:23:37,302 --> 01:23:39,302
I want to go more.

1064
01:23:39,302 --> 01:23:40,302
It's dangerous.

1065
01:23:40,302 --> 01:23:42,302
I can't go that far.

1066
01:23:42,302 --> 01:23:43,302
I will go more.

1067
01:23:43,302 --> 01:23:44,302
That's it.

1068
01:23:44,302 --> 01:23:45,302
Yes.

1069
01:23:45,302 --> 01:23:46,302
I will go.

1070
01:23:46,302 --> 01:23:47,302
I will go.

1071
01:23:47,302 --> 01:23:48,302
Let's go.

1072
01:23:48,302 --> 01:23:49,302
Yes!

1073
01:23:49,302 --> 01:23:50,302
Yes!

1074
01:23:50,302 --> 01:23:51,302
Yes!

1075
01:23:51,302 --> 01:23:52,302
Let's clap!

1076
01:23:52,302 --> 01:23:53,302
Let's clap!

1077
01:23:53,302 --> 01:23:55,302
I will do it if you do it.

1078
01:23:55,302 --> 01:23:58,270
Applause!

1079
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:59,270
It's late.

1080
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:00,270
It's late.

1081
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:02,270
Applause!

1082
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:20,906
What?

1083
01:25:22,906 --> 01:25:25,394
What did you do?

1084
01:25:25,394 --> 01:25:28,106
I'm in pain.

1085
01:25:28,106 --> 01:25:30,106
Did you stop the snow?

1086
01:25:34,122 --> 01:25:36,122
Applause!

1087
01:25:36,122 --> 01:25:38,122
It's a future story.

1088
01:25:38,122 --> 01:25:40,122
I can't believe it.

1089
01:25:42,122 --> 01:25:44,122
It's amazing.

1090
01:25:46,122 --> 01:25:48,122
Let's go.

1091
01:25:48,122 --> 01:25:50,122
It's a picture of the sky.

1092
01:25:50,122 --> 01:25:52,122
It's a picture of the sky.

1093
01:25:52,122 --> 01:25:54,226
It's a picture of the sky.

1094
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:00,090
It's amazing.

1095
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,090
It's amazing.

1096
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:04,090
I'm sorry.

1097
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:08,754
Are you hungry?

1098
01:26:08,754 --> 01:26:10,754
I'm hungry.

1099
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:12,754
You are cute.

1100
01:26:23,162 --> 01:26:25,162
Yes, this is it!

1101
01:26:27,162 --> 01:26:29,650
What a nice customer!

1102
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:33,586
Shin-enji!

1103
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:51,626
You too!

1104
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:17,426
This is my story. Don't you watch?

1105
01:29:11,226 --> 01:29:13,226
Yuriko, let's go!

1106
01:29:13,226 --> 01:29:14,226
Okay!

1107
01:29:17,722 --> 01:29:19,722
I'll measure your height.

1108
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:23,202
I'm 5'6.5.

1109
01:29:23,202 --> 01:29:25,202
Your height is also...

1110
01:29:25,202 --> 01:29:28,490
8'0.

1111
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:29,490
Please.

1112
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:31,490
Let's go, Mako.

1113
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:33,490
Here we go.

1114
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:35,490
Nice.

1115
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:37,490
That's right.

1116
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:39,490
Let's look at this side.

1117
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:41,490
That's right.

1118
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:43,490
Ref!

1119
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:45,490
Good.
