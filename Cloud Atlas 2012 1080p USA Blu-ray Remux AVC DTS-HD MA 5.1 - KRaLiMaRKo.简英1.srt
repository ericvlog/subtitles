1
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,630
孤独之夜
Lonesome night.

2
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,110
婴孩恸哭  寒风刺骨
Rabbits bawlin', wind bitin' the bone.

3
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,410
风中夹杂着
Wind like this

4
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,460
千万种声音
full of voices.

5
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,410
那是祖先
Ancestry howlin' at you,

6
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,410
诉说远古的故事
yibberin' stories.

7
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,820
所有声音
All voices

8
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,610
汇聚为一
tied up into one.

9
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,810
但有一个声音
One voice different.

10
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,070
与众不同
One voice,

11
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,050
在黑暗中觊觎
whisperin' out there,

12
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,040
窃窃私语
spyin' from the dark.

13
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,780
那是青面獠牙的魔鬼
That fangy devil,

14
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,540
老乔治
Ol' Georgie himself.

15
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,030
靠过来  仔细听
Now you hear up close,

16
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,080
我要给你们讲讲我和他第一次
and I'll yarn you about the first time we met,

17
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,100
四目相对的时刻
eye to eye.

18
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,010
于是我见到了亨利·古斯医生
And thus it was when I made the acquaintance of Dr. Henry Goose,

19
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,470
期望他能将我从痛苦中解救出来
the man I hoped might cure me of my afflictions.

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,670
你丢了什么吗
Have you lost something?

21
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,750
问题一
Question one.

22
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,740
思科史密斯的报告里有什么秘密
What secret in Sixsmith report

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,870
竟招来杀身之祸
would be worth killing for?

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,340
问题二
Question two.

25
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,470
是不是可以认为
Is it reasonable to believe

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,340
他们为了掩盖秘密会再开杀戒
that they would kill again to protect that secret?

27
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,800
如果是的话  第三个问题
And if so, question three.

28
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,740
我他妈的在这干什么
What the fuck am I doing here?

29
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,190
作为一个经验丰富的编辑
While my extensive experience as an editor

30
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,720
我是不屑用闪回
has lead me to a disdain for flashbacks

31
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,020
或是倒叙这种花哨的技巧的
and flash forwards, and all such tricksy gimmicks,

32
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,130
然而  亲爱的读者
I believe that if you, dear reader,

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,000
我还是希望您耐心一点
can extend your patience for a just a moment,

34
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,340
从我这疯狂的故事中理出头绪来
you will find there is a method to this tale of madness.

35
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,480
《云图六重奏》  作者：罗伯特·弗洛比舍

36
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,440
亲爱的思科史密斯
My dearest Sixsmith,

37
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,220
今早我用维维安·艾瑞斯的手枪
I shot myself through the roof of my mouth this morning,

38
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,300
饮弹自尽
with Vyvyan Ayrs' Luger.

39
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,530
真正的自杀是一场深思熟虑的谋划
A true suicide is a paced, disciplined certainty.

40
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,720
人们断言  自杀系懦夫之为
People pontificate "Suicide is an coward's act".

41
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,650
事实却是大相径庭
Couldn't be further from the truth.

42
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,350
自杀需要极大的勇气
Suicide takes tremendous courage.

43
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,110
有任何情况请按这个按钮
Any problem, sir, you just hit this button.

44
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,740
谢谢
Thank you.

45
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,350
我代表本部门以及统一体的未来
On behalf of my Ministry, and the future of Unanimity,

46
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,920
感谢您接受最后一次审讯
I would like to thank you for this final interview.

47
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,890
叫停核反应堆

48
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,540
不要让核反应堆害死我们

49
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,250
-你好  -媒体通行证
- Hello. - Press pass.

50
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,630
媒体通行证

51
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,510
以为我是找麻烦的吗
Expecting trouble?

52
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,010
我只是德蒙特·霍金斯的出版商
I was Dermot Hoggins' publisher,

53
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,450
又不是他的心理咨询师  或是算命的
not his shrink or his astrologer,

54
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,780
所以我确确实实没想到
and the ruddy, bloody truth is,

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,320
他那天晚上会干出那种事
I had no idea what the man was gonna do that night.

56
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,530
这片沙滩曾经是食人族
This beach was once a cannibal's banqueting hall,

57
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,980
吃掉弱者的地方
where the strong gorged on the weak,

58
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,910
但是他们会吐出牙齿
but the teeth, sir, they spat out,

59
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,880
就像我们吐樱桃核一样
like you and I would expel a cherry stone.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,200
你知道一磅牙齿能卖多少钱吗
Do you know the price a quarter pound of these will earn?

61
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,920
这并非是质问或是审判
Remember this is not an interrogation or a trial.

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,210
我们只要你描述事实
Your version of the truth is all that matters.

63
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,330
事实只有一个
Truth is singular.

64
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,100
主观的描述  都不是事实
Its "versions" are mistruths.

65
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,580
不要告诉他们我是为情自尽的
Don't let them say I killed myself for love.

66
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,920
我的确对其他人动过心 但天地你我皆知
Had my infatuations, but we both know in our hearts

67
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,480
在我昙花一现的生命中  你是我唯一的挚爱
who is the sole love of my short, bright life.

68
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,750
好了  尤因先生
There you are, Mr. Ewing,

69
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,170
不信教的地方
as binding a covenant there can ever be between men

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
就是这么签订契约的
outside the province of Scripture.

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,930
谢谢你  霍洛牧师
Thank you, Reverend Horrox,

72
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,920
我想我岳父听了一定欣喜若狂
I know my father-in-law is profoundly excited about this deal.

73
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,740
汉斯科尔·摩尔是一位伟人
Haskell Moore is a great man.

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,610
未来靠的就是他这种人
Future generations depend on men like him,

75
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,200
敢于直话直说
men capable of speaking the truth.

76
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,470
确实如此
Quite.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,140
第一次看汉斯科尔·摩尔的作品时
When I first encountered

78
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,340
我赞叹不已
Haskell Moore's writing,

79
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,910
他的文字简明而有力度
its perspicuity stroke me

80
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,810
犹如神旨天降
as though delivered through divine revelation.

81
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,360
这位博学的医生和我
The learned doctor here and I,

82
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,860
经常在晚上 研究讨论他的文章
already spent many a night debating Mr. Moore's tractus.

83
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,970
我倒想听听他如何解释
I'm only willing to conceive that he makes a compelling case

84
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,150
为何我们能坐下来  大快朵颐
as to why we are sitting here, enjoying this divine lamb,

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,990
库巴卡却要站在一旁  听候差遣
while Kupaka stands there, contempt to serve.

86
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,850
可不是吗  库巴卡
Indeed, ain'it. Kupaka,

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,500
你在这里过的挺自在的  对吧
you enjoy your life here with us, do you not?

88
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,830
先生  那是当然
Yes, Reverend, sir.

89
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,360
库巴卡很开心
Kupaka very happy here.

90
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,890
看吧  这就是摩尔的文明梯度理论
See, you see, this is Moore's ladder of civilization.

91
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,160
之所以会这样是因为
The reason behind this natural order...

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,940
好了  吉尔斯  闭嘴吧
Please, Giles, do shut up.

93
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,490
听你说了几个星期了
I've been listening to this for weeks,

94
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,300
来听听他自己女婿的看法
I would love to know what his own son-in-law has to say about it.

95
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,490
好吧
Let's see.

96
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,240
我认为  这是出于神的旨意和男人的天性
It is an inquiry concerning God's will and the nature of men.

97
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,770
那他对女人的天性有何看法
And what does he have to say about the nature of women?

98
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,920
恐怕他回避了这一问题
I'm afraid that's a subject he prefers to pass by in silence.

99
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,180
男人都这德行
He wouldn't be the first.

100
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,860
好了  继续吧
Prey, Mr. Ewing, continue.

101
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,250
他关注的问题是
The question he does pose is

102
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,210
如果神是造物主
if God created the world,

103
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,870
那我们如何判断 哪些事物我们可以改变
how do we know what things we can change,

104
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,370
哪些又神圣不可侵犯呢
and what things must remain sacred and inviolable?

105
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,560
霍洛牧师相信  管理殖民地最好的方法
Reverend Horrox' real specific how to run plantation.

106
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,170
就是乔治亚州的方法
Georgian way best way he say.

107
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,010
天啊  这么炎热的天
God, this heat is unbearable.

108
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,200
他们怎么受得了
How do they take it?

109
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,780
霍洛牧师说
Reverend Horrox say

110
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,970
奴隶如骆驼  生养于沙漠
slaves like camel, bred for desert.

111
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,460
他们并非文明人 是感觉不到炎热的
He say they not feel heat like civilized folk.

112
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,540
我们找个地方乘凉吧
Now we should get you out of the sun.

113
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,660
那是什么声音
Now what is that noise?

114
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,980
-你醒了  -发生了什么事
- There you are. - What happened?

115
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,480
跟我猜的一样  寄生虫惹的祸
It is as I suspected. Gusano Coco Cervello,

116
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,710
波利尼西亚蛆虫
better known as the Polynesian worm.

117
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,050
我见过生这种病
Once saw a man's brain

118
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,750
死掉的人 大脑像花椰菜一样
after the worm had finished with him maggoty cauliflower.

119
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,590
不过别担心
But have no fear,

120
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,850
我和这小魔鬼已经是老相识了
this particular devil and I are well acquainted.

121
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,850
吞下去  好了好了  没事了
Here we go. Yes, yes, all gone.

122
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,470
真不敢想要是没遇见你
I don't know what I would have done

123
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,970
我会怎么样
had our paths not crossed.

124
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,320
最起码你是活不成了
Well, for starters, you would have died.

125
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,280
我得报答你的恩情
I shall find a way to repay you.

126
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,520
没必要  真的
Unnecessary, I assure you.

127
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,660
我可是医生  亚当
I am a doctor, Adam.

128
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,330
这叫做江山易改  本性难移
A tiger cannot change its stripes.

129
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,630
思科史密斯
Sixsmith,

130
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,440
我恳请你原谅我
I do hope you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me.

131
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,060
弗洛比舍先生
Mr. Frobisher.

132
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,510
罗伯特·弗洛比舍先生
Mr. Robert Frobisher!

133
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,200
我们经理想要和您谈一谈  先生
The management would like a word with you, please, sir.

134
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,340
弗洛比舍先生  请开门
Mr. Frobisher, open this door, please!

135
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,160
我知道你在里面  请开开门
I do know you're in there, Mr. Frobisher, please, comply.

136
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,110
我们已经写信给您父亲了
A letter is being drafted to your father, sir.

137
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,090
弗洛比舍先生
Mr. Frobisher!

138
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,430
我不愿这样离开你
Hated leaving you like that.

139
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,940
不想以这种方式告别
Wasn't the goodbye I had in mind.

140
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,730
你读这封信时
By the time you read this,

141
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,590
我已启程去往爱丁堡
I will be on my way to Edinburgh,

142
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,620
去追求名与利
on my way to fame and fortune.

143
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,940
我想你没听说过维维安·艾瑞斯
I know you haven't heard of him,

144
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,170
但相信我
but trust me,

145
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,080
他可是位音乐巨匠
Vyvyan Ayrs is one of the musical greats, Sixsmith.

146
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,850
只可惜因为常年病痛
The tragedy is that he hasn't produced any new work

147
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,580
很久没有新作了
in years due to illness.

148
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,300
我打算说服他 让我做他的抄谱员
My scheme is to persuade him to hire me as his amanuensis,

149
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,120
协助他再创辉煌
and aid him in the creation of a masterpiece,

150
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,740
登上音乐界的巅峰
before shooting up through the musical firmament,

151
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,830
最终帕特就不得不承认
eventually obliging Pater to admit that yes,

152
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,650
他剥夺了继承权的儿子  罗伯特·弗洛比舍
the son he disinherited is none other than Robert Frobisher,

153
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,480
成为了当代最杰出的作曲家
the greatest British composer of his time.

154
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,490
思科史密斯  你现在一定在摇头叹息
I know, Sixsmith, you groan and shake your head,

155
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,970
可是你一定也在微笑
but you smile too,

156
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,660
我爱的就是这点
which is why I love you.

157
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,510
附
P.S.

158
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,000
谢谢你的马甲
Thanks for the waistcoat.

159
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,720
我需要有你的物品陪在身边
I needed something of yours to keep me company.

160
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,290
圣乔治与龙
St. George and the Dragon.

161
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,070
它提醒我作曲就像战斗
Reminds me that composing is a crusade.

162
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,520
人龙之争
Sometimes you slay the dragon,

163
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,530
必定是你死我活
sometimes the dragon slays you.

164
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,810
好了
Alright, then.

165
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,130
弗洛比舍  是吧
Frobisher, is it?

166
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,230
听了马克拉斯的交代  你应该能干点活了
I trust Mackerras told you enough to be useful.

167
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,170
这几个月  我脑海中
I've had this little melody for viola

168
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,970
都回响着一段中提琴旋律
rattling about my head for months,

169
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,500
看你能不能把它记下来
let's see if you can get it down.

170
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,210
第3小节前加装饰音
Subtle grace note before the third.

171
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,700
轻柔而简洁  明白不
Soft and simple. Got it?

172
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,650
接下来才是好戏
Now, it gets interesting.

173
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,060
好
Good.

174
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,050
从头弹一遍
Play that back.

175
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,130
是  先生
Would love to, sir.

176
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,840
请问是什么调呢
What key are we in?

177
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,540
这还用问吗  当然是G小调
What key? G minor, of course.

178
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,040
拍号呢
And the time signature?

179
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,970
天呐  你刚听什么了
For Christ's sake, did you hear it or not?

180
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,480
请再给我一点时间
Just need a little more time.

181
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,280
你说要时间
You need?

182
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,170
到底谁才是打工的
My dear boy, who is working for whom here?

183
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:47,930
很抱歉  先生
I apologize, sir.

184
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,930
你是来抄谱还是来道歉的
Are you an amanuensis or an apologist?

185
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,780
集中精神
Now pay attention.

186
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,410
4分之3拍
Three-four,

187
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,200
在第4小节转到4分之4拍
changes to four-four on fourth bar

188
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,540
在第5小节转到4分之3拍
and back to three-four on bar five,

189
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,500
数数你还是会的吧
if you can count that high.

190
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,260
四分音符dor 停一个八音符
Crotchet G, pause for a quaver,

191
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,690
重复八分音符dor
repeat G quaver,

192
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,470
然后在重拍时降mi
then E-flat on the down beat.

193
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,570
然后反复
And so on.

194
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,680
弹来听听
Alright, let me hear you.

195
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,900
停  求你了  折磨死我了
Stop, please! You're hurting me!

196
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,030
你没听错吧
You must have misheard me,

197
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,250
我嘴里的旋律被你弹成了垃圾
I said I had a melody not a malady!

198
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,180
维维安
Vyvyan.

199
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,860
乔科斯塔  扶我回房
Jocasta, deliver me!

200
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,760
你们在做什么
What's going on in here?

201
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,300
在浪费时间
An exercise in futility.

202
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,900
是不是该介绍一下呢
Should I be introduced?

203
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,730
没必要
There's really no point,

204
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,040
这孩子就是个花瓶
the boy is useful as the clap.

205
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,880
幸好不像花柳那么难缠
Fortunately, he'll be much easier to get rid of.

206
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,590
帮个忙  叫亨利来送他出去
Would you be a dear and get Henry to show the boy out.

207
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,210
没问题  亲爱的
Yes, of course, darling.

208
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,500
那简直是天籁
That's beautiful.

209
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,720
是啊
Yes.

210
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,290
这就是我心里的旋律
That's it. That's my melody!

211
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,270
别这样嘛  路易莎  我们是天生一对
Com'on, Luisa, we're made to be together!

212
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,550
听我说  路易莎
Luisa, Luisa, com'on, com'on, I'm telling you,

213
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,270
宝贝  你不能离开我
I'm telling you baby, you can't leave me. It's a...

214
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,830
不知道是前世还是未来
Don't know if it's a past life thing or a future life thing,

215
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,980
我和你
but you know, you and me...

216
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,730
整整一个小时
Look. For the last hour,

217
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,500
我都忍着不把你扔下楼去
all I could think about was throwing you off the balcony.

218
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,820
你以为你是哪根葱啊
Well then who the hell you think you are?

219
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,750
给垃圾专栏写几句垃圾有什么牛的
You write a bullshit column for a fucking rag.

220
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,060
等一下
Elevator!

221
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,820
谢谢
Thank you.

222
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,940
有个从骑士时代来的人真好
Nice to know the age of chivalry isn't dead.

223
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,540
你还好吗
You okay?

224
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,420
估计骨头没断
No bones broken, I think.

225
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,060
不  您别动  我来
No, no, no, you sit yourself. Let me see.

226
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,920
好极了  停电
Great. Power outage.

227
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,170
真是雪上加霜
Perfect end to a perfect day.

228
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,400
还觉得我给你开门是好事吗
Still glad the age of chivalry isn't dead?

229
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,980
我宁愿困在这儿
I'd still rather be right here

230
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,410
也不要回去
than back up there.

231
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,610
看来齐平先生不是人见人爱
Guess Mr. Kipin isn't everyone's cup of tea.

232
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,860
他是记者的噩梦
Guys like that are just an occupational hazard.

233
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,030
你在采访他吗
You were interviewing him?

234
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,930
没错  我来自《望远镜》杂志
Yeah, for Spyglass magazine.

235
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,560
叫路易莎·雷
Luisa Rey.

236
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,850
我是卢夫斯·思科史密斯
Rufus Sixsmith.

237
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,520
雷
Rey.

238
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,250
莫非你和记者莱斯特·雷有亲戚
You wouldn't happen to be related to the journalist Lester Rey?

239
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,720
他是我父亲
Yeah. He was my father.

240
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,550
真的吗  他要是看到女承父业
Really? He must have been enormously proud of you,

241
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,860
一定会为你自豪的
following in his footsteps.

242
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,070
这是我侄女  梅根
That's her. My niece, Megan.

243
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,990
真可爱
She's lovely!

244
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,590
天生的物理学家
Born physicist,

245
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,390
数学能力比我强多了
with a better mind for mathematics than I ever had.

246
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,010
在剑桥凯斯学院
Did her PhD at Cambridge,

247
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,590
修了博士学位
a woman at Caius!

248
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,220
让我觉得世界还是美好的
Gives you hope for the world.

249
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,910
热死了
It's hot.

250
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,720
而且还困在这里
And we're still here.

251
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,110
那是个很独特的胎记
That's a very peculiar birthmark.

252
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,680
是啊  我的小彗星
Yeah. My little comet.

253
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,940
我妈说那是癌症
My mother was sure it was cancer,

254
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,120
想方设法让我把它去掉  但是
She wanted me to get it removed, but...

255
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,530
我还挺喜欢它的
don't know. I kinda like it.

256
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,790
我认识一个人
I knew someone who had a birthmark that was...

257
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,920
他也有一模一样的胎记
similar to that.

258
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,870
真的假的
Really?

259
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,590
那是谁
Who was it?

260
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,160
我非常爱的一个人
Someone I cared about very much.

261
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,260
问你一个问题  雷小姐
A hypothetical question for you, Miss Rey.

262
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,740
作为一名记者
As a journalist,

263
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,450
为了保护消息来源 你愿意付出什么代价
what price would you pay to protect the source?

264
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,910
一切代价
Any.

265
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,030
牢狱之灾呢
Prison?

266
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,390
万不得已的话  也愿意
If it came to that, yes.

267
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,150
你愿意冒生命危险吗
Would you be prepared to compromise your safety?

268
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,300
我父亲刚正不阿
My father braved booby-trapped marshes

269
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,550
即使受强权威胁  也从不退缩
and the wrath of generals for his journalistic integrity.

270
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,930
如果稍有危险  我就畏缩不前
What kind of daughter would I be

271
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,220
不是丢了他的脸
if I bailed when things got a little tough?

272
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,070
得救了
Saved.

273
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,150
出租车
Taxi!

274
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,100
真的不搭车吗
You sure you don't need a cab?

275
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,850
不了  我自己开车来的
No, I've got my car.

276
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,890
如果你需要我帮忙
Well, you know if there's ever something I can do for you,

277
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,690
就打给我吧
please give me a call.

278
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,470
谢谢  我会的
Thank you, I will.

279
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,160
再见
Bye.

280
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,770
那晚是柠檬奖的庆祝宴会
It was the night of the Lemon Prizes,

281
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,350
虽然一晚上都在强颜欢笑
and amidst all that forced jollity,

282
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,530
但有那么一刻  我是在自省
I recall a moment of introspection.

283
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,890
选择做出版商  真是我这辈子
Why? Why would anyone in their right mind

284
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,110
最没脑子的决定
choose to be a publisher?

285
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,770
也就在那一刻 德蒙特找到了我
This was the precise moment that Dermot found me.

286
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,250
-蒂莫西  -德蒙特
- Timothy. - Dermot.

287
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,270
糟糕透顶了
Bad news inexorably does.

288
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,640
真他妈浪费
Fockin' waste.

289
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,300
赫尔曼·梅尔维尔生前写过一本
Never forget Herman Melville,

290
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,860
关于一条大白鲸的书[也就是《白鲸》]
writes a ripping yarn about a big white whale

291
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,670
当时也被大家忽视了
which is summarily dismissed,

292
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,730
然而今天
and yet today,

293
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,880
世界上每个文学学生
it is lugged around in the backpacks

294
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,090
都随身带着这本书
of every serious student of literature in the world.

295
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,110
我他妈不在乎我死后的事
I don't give a fock what happens when I'm dead,

296
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,320
我要他们现在就买老子的书
I want people to buy me book now!

297
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,070
作为这本书的发行人
As your publisher,

298
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,980
这当然也是我乐意看到的
obviously nothing would make me happier.

299
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,450
可惜  不知道是什么原因
But sadly, for whatever reason,

300
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,350
读者还没能理解《老拳夹击》
"Knuckle Sandwich" has yet to connect to its audience.

301
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,250
想知道原因吗
You want a reason?

302
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,570
我这就让你知道
I'll give you a reason.

303
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,500
-他就是原因  -你说芬奇先生吗
- Right there! - Aah. You mean Mr. Finch?

304
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,490
狗娘养的菲力·芬奇
Felix fockin' Finch!

305
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,380
在他那本娘娘腔杂志上
That cunt that shat all over me book

306
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,390
把我的书贬得像一坨狗屎
in his poncy fockin' magazine!

307
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,990
-没那么糟糕  -你说没那么糟
- It wasn't that bad! - No?

308
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,310
霍金斯这本自吹自擂的自传
"Mr. Hoggins should apologize to the trees

309
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,890
完全是浪费纸张  他应该向树木道歉
failed for the making of his bloated autobio novel.

310
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,630
一个索然无味的结尾
Four hundred vain-glorious pages expire in an ending

311
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,950
居然占了整整400页纸
that is flat and inane beyond belief."

312
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,870
冷静点  德蒙特
Steady now, Dermot.

313
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,530
评论家看书都是一扫而过
What is a critic but one who reads quickly,

314
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,810
自以为是  却从来不动脑子
arrogantly, but never wisely.

315
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,450
我操
Fock it.

316
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,150
德蒙特
Dermot!

317
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,430
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen!

318
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,410
各位同行  今晚有一个追加的特别奖项
We have an additional award tonight, fellow book faeries.

319
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,680
最杰出评论家奖
An award for "Most eminent critic".

320
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,850
就是这个
Mr...

321
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,930
不对  应该是
oh, beg pardon,

322
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:18,170
菲力·芬奇爵士  大英帝国勋章获得者
SIR! Felix Finch. O, B and E!

323
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,360
那请问奖励呢
And what might my prize be, I wonder?

324
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,650
送你一本还没变成废纸的签名版《老拳夹击》
A signed copy of an unpulped "Knuckle Sandwich"?

325
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,810
你的书基本上都是废纸吧
Can't be many of those left.

326
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,630
好吧
Well.

327
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,760
现在让我们看看
Just what does that lead-less pencil

328
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,070
你怎么用所谓的想象力
you call an imagination have in mind

329
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,760
结束这尴尬的一幕
to end this scene.

330
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,180
这种结局你应该会喜欢
I think you're gonna love this one.

331
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,200
这个结尾有味道吧
Now, that's an ending that is flat n'inane beyond belief.

332
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,770
你问我的想法
My thoughts?

333
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,720
说实话  我的惊恐像芬奇一样
If I'm honest, I admit that the obvious emotions like shock

334
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,970
一闪而过
and horror flew as Finch had, here and gone.

335
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,230
龙舌兰  这么多
Tequila, couple of fingers.

336
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,510
目睹这悲剧的一幕后
While deep down,

337
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,050
尽管我的心沉到了谷底
I experienced a nascent sense

338
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,020
一种绝处逢生的感觉却油然而生
of a silver lining to this most tragic turn.

339
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,510
一夜之间
Overnight,

340
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,480
"灰头土脸"德蒙特成了万人敬仰的大英雄
Dermot "Dusty" Hoggins became a cult hero to the common man.

341
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,020
作家1:0评论家

342
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,020
评论家晚宴遇袭身亡

343
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,020
甩你几条街  霍金斯送芬奇自由飞翔

344
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,680
《老拳夹击》
"Knuckle Sandwich"

345
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,490
两个月内狂售9万本
shifted 90000 copies in less than two months.

346
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,920
《老拳夹击》

347
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,060
我仿佛变成了灰姑娘
I was for the briefest of moments, Cinderella,

348
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,470
美梦成真后
and all memory of past misfortune receded

349
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,070
过去的不幸逐渐消逝
in the rearview mirror of my dream come true.

350
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,510
-我的娘啊  -蒂莫西还是什么来着
- What the fuck... - Tim-o-tee Cavendish... oy presume.

351
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,910
屎料未及吧
Caught wi' your cacks down!

352
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,760
我的工作时间是11点到下午2点
My office hours are eleven to two,

353
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,360
希望你们遵守程序
and my secretary would be more than happy

354
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,320
跟我的秘书预约一下
to schedule an appointment if you so desire.

355
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,620
我们那么熟  哪儿还要预约
Friends like us don't need appointments.

356
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,250
我们就是这么随便
We like it all cozy like this.

357
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,990
我们去探望了一下德蒙特
Visited Dermot in the joint.

358
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,920
他有事要问你
Our brother's got a question for you.

359
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,830
我们那份钱呢
Where's our focking money?

360
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,740
伙计们  我跟你们说
Boys. Boys, look here.

361
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,940
德蒙特签了一份版权转让合同
Dermot signed what we call a copyright transfer contract,

362
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,990
上面写明...
which means that legally...

363
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,450
德蒙特才没有签那狗屁合同
Dermot didn't sign a fockin' contract for the event of a season!

364
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,470
那或许我们可以友好协商一下
Perhap-perhaps... er, we could moot a provisional sum

365
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,040
分一部分钱出来
as a basis for on-going negotiation.

366
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,030
好呀
Okey dokey.

367
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,520
一部分钱是多少钱
What sum we gonna moot?

368
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,240
最少5万
Fifty K will do for starters.

369
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,560
5万挺合理的
Fifty sounds reasonable.

370
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,060
明天下午前给我们
Tomorrow afternoon.

371
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,430
明天下午
Tomorrow afternoon?

372
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,020
要现金  少废话
Cash.  No bullocks.

373
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,220
-不要支票  -只收纸钞
- No checks. - Old fashioned money.

374
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,300
先生们
Gentlemen.

375
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,230
-法律规定  -法律
- The law says... - The law?!

376
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,240
法律为他妈的菲力·芬奇做什么了吗
What'd the law do for Felix fockin' Finch?

377
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,130
通常
Ordinarily,

378
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:32,360
我会先让犯人回忆早期的记忆
I begin by asking prisoners to recall their earliest memories

379
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,220
统一体

380
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,500
给未来的历史学家
to provide a context

381
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,000
提供研究材料
for the corporatic historians of the future.

382
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,790
人造人并没有这种记忆  先生
Fabricants have no such memories, Archivist.

383
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,470
我们在宋老爹餐厅的每一天
One twenty-four hour cycle in Papa Song's

384
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,690
都是一模一样的
is identical to every other.

385
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,640
你的通用语说的很好
May I say you speak Consumer surprisingly well.

386
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,770
可惜统一体的政府官员
It is unfortunate that the officials of the Unanimity

387
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,610
只能说一种语言
can only speak one language.

388
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,170
作为统一体的政府人员
As an officer of Unanimity,

389
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,130
我当然只能说这一种语言
I am of course restricted from using sub speak.

390
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,540
我看也是
Of course.

391
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,310
请详细描述宋老爹餐厅24小时的运作
Please describe a typical twenty-four hour Papa Song cycle.

392
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,860
早上4点  所有人会被刺激素唤醒
At hour four, each server is woken by auto-stimulin.

393
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,220
星美-451

394
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,280
然后前往清洗室
From revival, we proceed to the hygiener.

395
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,260
穿好衣服后  排队进入餐厅
After dressing, we file into the dinery.

396
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,240
5点钟
At hour five,

397
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,920
我们各自就位 开始服务客人
we man our stations to greet the new day's consumers.

398
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,950
欢迎光临宋老爹餐厅
Welcome to Papa Song's.

399
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,760
接下来的19个小时
For the next nineteen hours,

400
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,250
我们负责下单  送餐  续杯
we input orders, tray food, vend drinks,

401
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,420
加调料  擦桌子  倒垃圾
upstock condiments, wipe tables, and bin garbage,

402
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,550
一切都严格遵循第一准则
all done in strict adherence to First Catechism.

403
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,450
什么是第一准则
What is the First Catechism?

404
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,330
顾客就是上帝
"Honor Thy Consumer."

405
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,080
收拾完后
After the final cleaning,

406
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,240
我们摄入一袋汤食 然后返回睡眠舱
we imbibe one soap sack and return to our sleep box.

407
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,560
这就是每天的流程
That is the blueprint of every single day.

408
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,520
你曾经想过未来吗
Did you ever think about the future?

409
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,720
宋老爹的服务员 只有一种可能的未来
Papa Song servers have just one possible future.

410
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,810
你是说极乐
You mean "Exultation".

411
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,850
你能描述一下这一年一度的仪式吗
Could you describe this annual Rite of Passage?

412
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,350
每年第一天
On first day,

413
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,350
李总管 在每个人的颈圈上打星号
Seer Rhee would stamp a star on each of our collars.

414
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,740
十二颗星代表契约期满
Twelve stars meant an end to our contract.

415
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,770
当你看到有姐妹进入极乐了  有什么感觉
How did you feel when you watched one of your sisters ascend?

416
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,710
兴奋
Excitement.

417
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,720
我为她们高兴
I was happy for them,

418
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,010
但同时也很嫉妒
but envious as well.

419
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,910
你的姐妹们也有同感吗
Did your sister servers feel as you did?

420
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,070
不全是
Most of them.

421
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,320
我想听下声名狼藉的育娜-939的事情
I would like to ask about the infamous Yoona-939.

422
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,060
星美-451

423
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,670
育娜-939唤醒了你
If Yoona-939 woke you,

424
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,780
那谁唤醒了她
who woke her?

425
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,320
李总管
Seer Rhee.

426
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,750
总管为什么要唤醒服务员
Why would Seer wake a server?

427
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,440
档案员  或许你应该问他
Perhaps you should ask him, Archivist.

428
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,260
他怎么了
What's wrong with him?

429
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,330
他喝了汤食
He drinks soap.

430
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,430
这让他很快乐
It makes him happy.

431
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,520
然后他就像我们一样酣睡了
Then he sleep like us in our box.

432
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,470
你曾经想过...
Do you ever think about...

433
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,590
服务员到了那边
what it must be like,

434
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,340
是什么样子吗
up there with the consumers?

435
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,430
第三本手册禁止这种问题
Third Catechism forbids such questions.

436
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,820
是的  是禁止
Yes. It does.

437
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,770
来吧  给你看个秘密
Come. Let me show you a secret.

438
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,310

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,630
视频播放器
A Kino?

443
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,110
-这是不行的  -星美  不会有人知道的
- We are not allowed. - Sonmia, No one will ever know.

444
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,140
来吧

这违反了监禁法案

449
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,820
你可能会被剔除
You could have been excised.

450
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,910
你为何要冒这个险
How did you justify such a risk to yourself?

451
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,750
她是我的朋友
She was my friend.

452
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,510
请从你的视角
Please describe the events of September 18th

453
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,990
描述9月18日的事件

454
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,710
我被安排在一号台服务

455

-快去吧  -秀两手

457
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,870
退后

460
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:34,180
夏威夷群岛  末日后第106个冬季

461
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,770
这生活失去了微笑  充满了无趣
Nay, this life all rot n' lockin' no smile a' some yawnee.

462
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,210
在后来的日子里

亚当像往常一样
It was Adam's custom to cult out his ancestry

467
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,890
心怀敬畏祭祀祖先
with offerin's n' honorin's.

468
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,560
突然间
Suddenwise,

469
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,790
那个青面獠牙的恶魔

476
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,560

弱肉强食

乔纳斯  不要

487
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,290
真相就是如此

整个山谷都在传言
Whole valley whisperin' about

489

是我害死了亚当和他的儿子

但罗斯和凯金从不相信这些谣言
But Rose and Catkin never believed those rumors,

491
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,780

493
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,670
先知们每年两次来交换物品
Prescients come batterin' twice a year,

494
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,390
他们的飞船远赴重洋
their ships creep-crawlin' on the waves,

495
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,310
靠末世之前的科技前行

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,340
交易马上就要开始了

是啊  去找你妈妈吧

498
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,770
你怎么了
What are you doin'?

499
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,580
妈妈说自从司露莎的事后你就不对劲
Ma says ya ain't been right since Sloosha's.

500

504
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,890

Why words slink n' slide off a tongue, when we need them most?

508
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,420
如果我的舌头更大胆点
If my tongue'd been more bold,

509
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,210
是不是就可以阻止将要发生的灾难
could I have stopped all that diresome's about to happen?

510
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,490

516
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,190
那让她招待去吧

517

扎克里  我给你带了礼物

他们好奇心十足地看着

522
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,200
仿佛星美现身了一样
like Sonmi herself was sittin' in our kitchen.

523
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,050
先知们的飞船

为什么那么快
n' their whoahsome Ship poured thick n'fast.

没人问融合引擎是什么
No one queried what fusion engine was,

528
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,430
因为不想让人觉得自己愚蠢
cos they didn't want to look stupid in front o' the gatherin'.

529
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,630

但依然浇不灭大家的好奇心
but no answer ever quenched your curio.

532
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,880
她回答得越多  大家越不相信她
All o' that answerin' done was teach everyone to not trust her,

533
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,510
哪怕是一点点

双手流血勿松手

Thank you. Thank you, Abbess. Thank you.

557
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,030
星美-451
Sonmi 451.

558
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,120
等等  等等
Wait! Wait.

559
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,680
不用躲着我
There's... no reason to hide.

560
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,230
我知道你  星美-451
I know you are... Sonmi-451.

561
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,720
我叫张海柱
My name is... Hae-Ju Zheng.

562
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,050
李总管怎么了
What has happened to Seer Rhee?

563
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,210
汤食过量
Soap overdose.

564
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,460
很不幸
It is unfortunate

565
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,800
事业正盛时遭遇这种事
that it had to happen with everything gone so well.

566
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,480
因为现在执法者
Cos now it is probable that the Enforcers

567
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,050
和DNA嗅探器很可能会发现你
and the DNA sniffers will find out about you.

568
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,780
如果他们查到你...
And if they do...

569
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,940
如果他们意识到你和育娜-939的关系
if they realize your connection to Yoona-939,

570
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,420
你就会被剔除
you will be excised.

571
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,540
但你可以选择
But you have a choice.

572
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,440
留在这里  冒着被查到的风险
You can remain here and risk being discovered,

573
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,420
或者和我一起走
or you can come with me.

574
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,450
改变航道  伙计们
Bear away, boy.

575
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,690
遵命  船长
Aye, aye captain.

576
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,710
15号周五
Friday the 15th.

577
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,800
我们早潮时扬帆起航
We made sail with the morning tide.

578
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,400
波海威先生更改了我的船舱
Mr. Boerhaave had my cabin changed.

579
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,550
让我住在储藏室里
I have been quarantined

580
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,400
与其他乘客和船员隔离
to a store room away from the other passengers and crew.

581
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,380
亨利争论说波利尼西亚蠕虫不传染
Henry argued in vain that the Polynesian worm

582
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,820
但没有用
was not contagious.

583
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,260
这些都无关紧要
Not that it matters.

584
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,090
现在我只想赶紧回家
All I want to do now is return home

585
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,540
好好放松身心
and unburden myself from this responsibility.

586
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,350
《太平洋日记》

587
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,710
亲爱的思科史密斯
My dear Sixsmith,

588
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,560
我非常渴望你的帮助
I am in desperate need of your help.

589
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,320
收到我上一封信后
After my last letter,

590
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,460
你肯定在准备行囊了
I'm sure you're rushing to pack your bags,

591
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,990
但是不要来  真的
but you needn't, really.

592
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,320
当然
Unless of course,

593
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,670
除非你希望亲眼目睹罗伯特·弗洛比舍的重生
you wish to witness the rebirth of Robert Frobisher.

594
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,250
真神奇
Is it not miraculous

595
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,140
人的运势 可以转变得这么快
how one's fortune can turn so quickly,

596
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,900
这么彻底
so completely.

597
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,550
前一刻还狼狈的跳窗而逃
One moment, leaping from a hotel window,

598
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,270
下一刻就荣幸地被世界上
the next gainfully employed

599
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,030
最伟大的作曲家之一雇用
by one of the world's greatest living composers.

600
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,300
《太平洋日记》

601
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,400
唯一的困扰是机缘巧合  我迷上了一本日记
My only problem is that I accidentally got hooked on a journal

602
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,500
是一个濒死的律师在1849年
written in 1849 by a dying lawyer during the voyage

603
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,120
从太平洋岛屿到旧金山时写的
from the Pacific islands to San Francisco.

604
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,600
可是日记只有前半本
To my great annoyance, the pages cease mid-sentence.

605
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,930
后半本找不到
Half the book is missing.

606
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,910
但我非常着迷
It's completely getting me.

607
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,120
方便的话  下次去奥拓书店买书时
Could you be a mensch and when you're next foraging

608
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:26,200
帮忙问一下
at Otto's Book's, make an inquiry?

609
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,580
毕竟一本不完整的书
A half finished book is, after all,

610
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,670
就像一段不完整的情缘
a half finished love affair.

611
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,890
美国爱石油
America loves oil.

612
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,270
美国已经对石油上瘾了
America is addicted to oil.

613
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,270
有些人幻想用风能和沼气来替代
Some fantasize about wind turbines or peat gas.

614
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:55,180
天鹅颈  核能集团

615
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,670
但我在这里要告诉你们
But I'm here today to tell you that the cure

616
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,700
解决的方法在这里
for oil is right here.

617
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,440
就是核能
The cure is nuclear power.

618
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,270
就是天鹅颈
The cure is Swannekke.

619
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,310
天鹅颈水合反应堆

620
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,960
你好
Hello?

621
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,160
你好  雷小姐
Hello, Miss Rey.

622
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,780
很抱歉在这个时间打扰你
I'm frightfully sorry for calling you at this hour.

623
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,840
思科史密斯博士
Dr. Sixsmith?

624
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,580
我需要帮助
I need help.

625
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,480
我需要50000英镑
I need 50,000 pounds,

626
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,030
不是2000  是50000
not 2,000, 50,000!

627
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,620
我重新核对了一遍  卡文迪许先生
I'm going through it again, Mr. Cavendish,

628
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,510
但总数是对的
but the total's right.

629
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,310
就是2343英镑16便士
2,343 pounds and 16 pence.

630
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:32,300
怎么可能  我可是赚了一大把
How is this possible? The ruddy money was pouring in.

631
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,920
主要用于还债了  卡文迪许先生
Debts mostly, Mr. Cavendish.

632
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,420
主动还债也是有弊端的
Solvency has its drawbacks.

633
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,510
情况看起来很糟糕
The situation looked dire,

634
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,490
但我蒂莫西·卡文迪许在这的资本
but I knew that Timothy Cavendish's capital in this town

635
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,610
可不是几个数字能体现的
could not be defined by an accountant's balance sheet!

636
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,900
麦克拉斯基
McCluskie!

637
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,070
你家可爱的小孙子孙女怎么样了
Look, how are those delightful kiddies of yours?

638
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,820
亲爱的  我是"贪婪的卡文迪许"
Mon cher, tis "Cavendish the Ravenous,"

639
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,470
你最爱的蒂莫西
Your favorite Timothy.

640
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,640
亲爱的先生
Mon cher?

641
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,700
你没听错
You heard it correctly,

642
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,600
狄更斯写作的桌子 60000镑出售
Charles Dickens' own original authentic writing desk for £ 60,000.

643
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,720
我认为价格很公道
I think that's very fair.

644
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,350
但我们的记录显示书桌已经
But our records indicate that the desk is already accounted for

645
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,870
由狄更斯博物馆收藏
by the Dickens House Museum.

646
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,560
好吧  那亚瑟·柯南道尔爵士的书桌怎么样
Okay, what about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's desk?

647
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,990
黑暗中我突然看到了曙光
In the darkness, I suddenly saw the light.

648
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,050
血总归浓于水
Blood has always trumped water.

649
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:34,080
连霍金斯都找了家人帮忙
If the Hogginses brutes wanted to turn this into a family affair,

650
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,990
我们卡文迪许家族
they'd find the Cavendish Clan

651
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,720
可比他们更厉害
more than ready for the task at hand.

652
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,280
龟孙子的  又来了
Oh, Satan's gonads, not again.

653
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,840
听着 赶紧滚开  让我们清净点
Look, just bugger off and leave us in peace.

654
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,410
我只给你一次机会
I'm only gonna asking you nicely once.

655
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,400
很高兴看到你  丹尼
Good to see you, Denny.

656
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,150
你不把上次还清
I'm not lending you a ruddy farthing

657
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,910
我一毛都不借给你
until you pay back the last lot.

658
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,100
为什么  为什么我要一直帮你
Why-Why should I be forever giving you a hand out?

659
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,990
丹尼...
Denny...

660
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,760
我惹了些不该惹的人
I had a minor running with the wrong sort.

661
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,800
如果拿不出60000英镑
If I don't get my hands on £ 60,000,

662
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,500
我就会被揍惨的
I got to get an awful beating.

663
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,710
让他们录下来发给我  赶紧滚
Well, get them to video it for us, would you? Now fuck off.

664
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,390
丹尼  我不是在开玩笑
I'm not joking, Denholme.

665
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,850
关我什么事
Why is this my problem?

666
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,310
我们是兄弟啊
Because we're brothers!

667
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,970
你不受良心谴责吗
Don't you have a conscience?

668
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,220
吃几片药 再来杯好酒我就没事了
Couple of my special little pills and a G&T should just set me right.

669
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,540
丹尼
Denny.

670
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:20,930
帮帮我
Help.

671
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,750
求你了
Please.

672
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,020
丹  你在和谁说话
Den, who are you talking to?

673
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,910
你好  乔洁特
Hello, Georgette.

674
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,060
你好  蒂莫西
Hello, Timothy.

675
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,850
好了  好了  好了
Right. Right, right.

676
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:40,830
60000对吗
What did you-60 grand?

677
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:43,010
要花点时间  但是...
It's gonna take some time, but, uh...

678
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,710
我先找个好地方让你躲起来吧
in the interim, I've got the perfect place for you to hide.

679
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,850
我开始害怕
I begun to fear

680
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,920
再也不能与深爱的蒂尔达相拥
I might never hold my beloved Tilda in her arms again.

681
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,140
寄生虫在夜间蠕动
My parasite writhes at night,

682
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,950
让我痛苦的痉挛
igniting spasms of pain,

683
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,570
光怪陆离的图像和声音萦绕在周围
while visions and voices, obscene and monstrous, haunt me.

684
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,640
尤因先生...
Mister Ewing...

685
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,020
我的上帝
In the name of God!

686
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,580
尤因先生  不要害怕
Mister Ewing, no fear.

687
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,750
不伤害你  不要叫喊
No harm, not shout.

688
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,560
求你了  我叫奥图阿
Please. My name Autua.

689
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,080
你见过我...
You know I...

690
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,520
看到莫里奥里人鞭打我...
see Moriori whip I...

691
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,320
你见过我
You know I.

692
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,410
你想要什么
What do you want?

693
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,420
你的帮助  尤因先生
You help, Mr. Ewing.

694
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:30,060
如果你不帮我  我就死定了
If you no help, I in trouble dead.

695
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,170
你已经非常"死定了"
Well, you're already very much "In trouble dead".

696
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,960
女先知号是商船
The Prophetess is a mercantile vessel,

697
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,470
不是偷运奴隶的
not an underground railroad for escaping slaves.

698
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,760
我能做水手  我可以赚船票
I able seaman, I earn passage.

699
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,760
那么我建议你
Well, then I suggest you

700
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,050
去求船长的宽恕吧
surrender to the captain's mercies forthwith.

701
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,970
不不  他们不会听我的
Wow wow. They no hear I.

702
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,420
他们会说"游回家去吧  黑鬼"
They say "Swim away home, nigger",

703
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,510
然后把我扔到海里  而您...
and throw I in drink, but you...

704
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,780
您是律师  对吧  求您
you law man, right? Please.

705
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,280
船长听您的  尤因先生
Captain hear you, Mr. Ewing.

706
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,840
我  我帮不了你
I-I can't help you.

707
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,800
恐怕你要靠你自己了
I'm afraid your fate is entirely your own,

708
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,600
我不想插手
and I desire no part in it.

709
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,750
那么杀了我吧
Then kill I.

710
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,900
别傻了
Don't be absurd...

711
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,190
如果您不帮我
If you no help,

712
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,330
我同样得死 真的
you kill I just the same, is true.

713
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,470
您知道的
You know it.

714
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,780
我不要做鱼食  尤因先生
I'm be no fish food, Mr. Ewing.

715
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,860
死在这里更好
Die here better.

716
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:18,440
来吧
Do it.

717
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,110
快点下手
Do it quick.

718
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,950
队长  我发现了一个旧路标
I found an old transway marker, Captain.

719
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,960
那里应该就是红山
It's got to be the red mountain.

720
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,520
问题是  山谷里的人害怕它
The problem is, the valley people are afraid of it.

721
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,220
他们认为恶魔住在那里
They think the Devil lives up there.

722
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,790
没人愿意带我穿过科纳领地
I can't find anybody to guide me through the Kona territory.

723
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,340
梅洛内...
Meronym...

724
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:42,390
多待一天  你的身体就差一点
Every day you're out there, you increase your odd levels.

725
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,570
你的梦想会害死你的  为了什么呢
This dream of yours is going to kill you. And for what?

726
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:49,660
地外殖民地可能已经不存在了
The Off-World colonies may no longer exist.

727
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,670
队长  我要走了
I got to go, Captain.

728
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,740
谢谢你能来  我在1404
Thank you for coming, I'm in 1404.

729
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,100
我这就上去
I'll be right up.

730
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,330
天鹅颈水合反应堆

731
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,370
思科史密斯博士
Dr. Sixsmith?

732
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,110
思科史密斯博士
Dr. Sixsmith?

733
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,390
是我  路易莎
It's me, Luisa.

734
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,410
打电话  快点  叫警察来
Go call the police. Right now, call the police!

735
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,430
亲爱的思科史密斯
My dear Sixsmith,

736
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:24,310
只有你 能理解我现在的感受
you alone can understand how I'm feeling right now.

737
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,440
今天  艾瑞斯和我
Today, Ayrs and I

738
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,870
将我们的第一部作品给了塔德斯·凯塞林
presented our first collaboration to Tadeusz Kesselring,

739
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:32,720
艾瑞斯最喜欢的乐队指挥  来自柏林
Ayrs favorite conductor who arrived from Berlin.

740
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,780
作品叫"永恒的循环"
It's called "Eternal recurrence".

741
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,100
希望你能听听
Wish you could hear it.

742
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,730
这是一战以来
It's the most accomplished tone poem

743
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,370
最精妙的乐章
i know of written since the war,

744
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:41,730
而且  思科史密斯
and I tell you, Sixsmith,

745
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,610
其中好多旋律都是我的创作
that more than of the few of its best ideas are mine.

746
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,850
在我们那个年代 艾瑞斯
At our time of life, ayrs,

747
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:56,140
是没人敢如此大胆的创作的
a man has no right to such daring ideas.

748
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,670
看来我这把宝刀
I suppose I've won a rearguard

749
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,260
还不是那么老
action or two in my war against decrepitude.

750
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,100
晚餐是波尔多酒雉鸡  还有奶油乳酪
Diner of pheasant with Bordeaux rich as buttercream.

751
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,510
我很喜欢听不同的人聊天
How I love to listen to men of distinguished lives,

752
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,970
歌唱过去的丑恶与荣耀
sing of past follies and glories.

753
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,740
整个晚上唯一的插曲是
The only broken note in the entire evening

754
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,670
艾瑞斯的妻子  乔科斯塔
was Ayrs wife, Jocasta,

755
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,450
提前离席了
excusing herself early.

756
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,930
感觉有内情
Sensed the buried bone.

757
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,030
后来我问了艾瑞斯
Later I asked Ayrs about it.

758
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,010
他说是凯塞林将乔科斯塔介绍给他的
He said Kesselring had introduced Jocasta to him.

759
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,540
我又打探了一下  凯塞林是否和她相爱过
I pried, had Kesselring been in love with her?

760
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,260
这个问题很麻烦
The subject was a prickly one.

761
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,740
乔科斯塔是犹太人
Jocasta is a Jew.

762
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,190
显然他们之间是不可能的
Obviously her relationship was impossible.

763
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,860
为什么显然
Why obviously?

764
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:46,590
你不知道德国现在的局势吗
Can you really be so ignorant of what is happening in Germany?

765
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,560
思科史密斯  在这时
At this point in my life,

766
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,130
我才知道
all I know, Sixsmith,

767
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,540
有股力量改变着世界
is that this world spins from the same unseen forces

768
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,140
也扭曲了我们
that twist our hearts.

769
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,810
-扎克里  你好吗  -还可以
- How is it, Mr. Zachry? - Thin whiles.

770
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,550
-介意一起吗  -不介意
- Minding some company? - Nay.

771
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,080
但...
But...

772
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,640
羊和牧人介意  他们脾气可不好
Goats, and so do herders, they're known for housin' temper.

773
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,090
不好意思  你好像介意
Feelin' that own n' your reveal count out,

774
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,680
我突然出现在你家
for invadin' your house with no saysoe.

775
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,470
真的很抱歉
True sorrysome.

776
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,870
现在没关系了
Well it... Now it's done.

777
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,810
你介意陌生人过问你的辉煌史吗
So, you mindin' a stranger coverin' about your thrivin'?

778
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,400
成交  一问换一问
Swap you. Query for query.

779
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,290
好吧
Fair buy.

780
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:40,700
你不是来学缝衣服和挤牛奶的
Cog you and come dow. Learn stitchin' n' milkin' our heardin'.

781
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,580
你为什么来这里
Why you here?

782
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,740
我需要一个向导
I needin' a guide.

783
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,040
向导  去哪里
Guide? To where?

784
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:52,830
毛娜索尔
Mauna Sol.

785
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,660
桥之将断藏下头
"Bridge is broken, hide below"

786
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:06,860
怎么了
What's wrong?

787
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,050
我们一生都回旋在旧日的轨迹中
We cross and recross our old tracks like figure skaters.

788
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:43,990
就在我读这部新作品时
And just as I was reading a new submission,

789
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,120
《半衰期  一段路易莎·雷迷事》  作者  贾维尔·戈麦兹

790
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,830
一种似曾相识的感觉油然而生
a powerful déjà-vu ran through my bones.

791
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,390
我之前到过那里
I had been there before.

792
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:54,860
恍如隔世
Another lifetime ago.

793
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,240
乌苏拉
Ursula.

794
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,650
我一生的至爱
The love of my life.

795
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,520
没人比得上她
I could think of no other serious applicants.

796
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,890
她怎么样了
What had happened to her?

797
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,350
更重要的是
And more importantly,

798
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,000
那个也坐在这列车中
what had happened to the young man

799
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,560
为爱人赋词作诗的年轻人
who had ridden the same train composing sonnets,

800
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,590
又怎么样了
to his so bound a love.

801
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,660
女祭司  你的预言应验了
Your augurin' come true, Abbess.

802
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:22,730
桥断了  像你说的一样
Broke bridge, just like you say.

803
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,570
梅洛内在那里  在她身后
Meronym wa' there, yeb her aback,

804

《星美-451启示录》  由档案员朴记录

805
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,090
她想去毛娜索尔
trackin' up Mauna Sol,

806
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,520
为什么这个先知给我的生活带来了诅咒
why can this Prescient woman come cursin' n' twistin' on my life?

807
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,500
记住星美的话
Mind the words of Sonmi.

808
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,810
"我们的生命不仅仅属于自己
"Our lives are not our own.

809
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:42,440
从生到死  我们与他人息息相关
From womb to tomb, we are bound to others.

810
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,870
过去和现在
Past and present.

811
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,180
每一次罪孽...
And by each crime...

812
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,650
以及每一次善行...
and every kindness...

813
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,640
来世都将有报"
rebirth our future."

814
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:10,160
欢迎来到新首尔
Welcome to Neo Seoul.

815
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:23,880
来吧  出来吧
Come on, out you come.

816
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,920
这...或许是我这辈子最大的错误
This... maybe the biggest mistake of my life,

817
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,030
- 但是给你  - 尤因先生  谢谢
- but here.   - Thank you, Mr. Ewing.

818
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,070
谢谢
Thank you.

819
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:36,520
说实话  我担心你饿狠了
Now to tell the truth, I was worried you might try and eat me,

820
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,020
把我吃了
if you didn't get something in the stomach.

821
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,220
尤因先生  你很安全
Oh, you safe, Mr. Ewing.

822
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,340
我不爱吃白肉
I no like white meat.

823
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,480
好吧
Ah. Right.

824
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,660
在我想好怎么帮你前
Before I decide what I'm going to do with you,

825
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,320
能告诉我为什么他们要鞭打你吗
tell me why you were being whipped so savagely?

826
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:57,530
我叔叔曾是个水手
My uncle was a sailor.

827
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:01,520
我十岁的时候他把我带上了捕鲸船
He took me on a French whaler when I was ten years old.

828
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,430
见到了世界的精彩
Seen too much of the world.

829
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,190
我不是个好奴隶
I no good slave.

830
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,640
你当时为什么看我
Why did you look at me?

831
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,700
疼痛很强烈  不是吗
Pain strong, right?

832
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,170
但朋友的眼神更强大
Friends eye more strong.

833
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,110
你是个逃跑的奴隶  而我是个律师
Look, you are a runaway slave, and I am a lawyer.

834
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,300
你怎么知道我们能成为朋友
How did you imagine we could possibly be friends?

835
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,640
这就够了
All you need.

836
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,700
天啊
Ah, Jesus!

837
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,830
贾维尔·戈麦兹
Javier Gomez,

838
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,580
不是告诉过你 别跳上我的阳台吗
what did I tell you about jumping onto my balcony?

839
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,030
不想让我进来就不要开着门啊
Why d'you leave the door open if you don't want me to come in?

840
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,480
听着  小机灵鬼
Because, smarty pants,

841
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,890
比跳上阳台更糟糕的事
the only thing worse than having you jumping onto my balcony,

842
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,250
就是看你跳上了窗台
is the idea of you jumping onto my balcony,

843
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,530
却被锁在了外面
and being stuck out there.

844
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:56,510
好吧
Okay!

845
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,310
你在看什么
What are you reading?

846
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,320
一些旧信件
Old letters.

847
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:09,290
思科史密斯  剧情在这里走向了肉欲
Sixsmith, the plot has taken a sensual turn.

848
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,360
上周  我和乔科斯塔成为了情人
Last week, Jocasta and I became lovers.

849
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,800
不过不要惊慌
But don't alarm yourself,

850
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,590
我们只是肉体上的  履行职责一样
it is only a carnal act, performed in service,

851
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:20,250
就好像我是个抄写员一样
not unlike my role as amanuensis.

852
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,750
我承认  女人的心对我来说
And I confess women's hearts

853
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,130
依然很神秘  就像她们的欲望一样
like their desire remain a mystery to me.

854
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,800
事后   她哭着感谢我
Afterward, she cried and thanked me

855
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,980
给他们家重新注入了活力
for bringing life back into their home.

856
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,910
我清楚的感觉到维维安整晚都在我们之间
I can get clear that Vyvyan had been there the entire night,

857
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,840
就好像音符间的休止符一样
between us like the silence between notes,

858
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,100
是通往温馨乐章的钥匙
that holds the key to warm music.

859
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:49,090
又及  大好消息
P.S: Best news of all,

860
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,560
我开始创作自己的作品了
I've started my own work.

861
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:02,040
我...想找一张旧唱片
Uh, I... called about an old recording,

862
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:05,100
作者的名字叫罗伯特·弗洛比舍
written by a man named Robert Frobisher.

863
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,070
找对地方了
Oops. Passed it.

864
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,870
我知道我不应该把它拿出来
I know I shouldn't be pulling it,

865
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,970
就是想检查有没有划坏
I was checking it to make sure it wasn't scratched,

866
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,070
可是  说实话
but... honestly,

867
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,320
我一听就停不下来了
I just can't stop listening to it.

868
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,300
这就是云图六重奏吗
This is the Cloud Atlas Sextet?

869
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,940
罗伯特·弗洛比舍  《云图六重奏》

870
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,070
这就是交响乐
It's... the symphony.

871
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,310
真美
It's beautiful.

872
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,240
不过我觉得我以前听过
But I think I've heard this before.

873
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,290
不会吧
I can't imagine how.

874
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,160
我估计这唱片
I doubt there's no more than a...

875
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,740
全北美也就只有那么几张
handful copies in the whole of North America.

876
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,230
可是我知道它
But I know it.

877
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,510
我知道我听过
I know I know it.

878
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,940
在我意识到之前
Before I realized it,

879
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:53,110
我的双脚已经把我带回到了祭祀神庙
my feet had brought me back to the Temple of Sacrifice,

880
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,570
在那里  我奉上了我的童贞
where I offered up my virginity.

881
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,410
重回那四日天堂
Back to those four-days of Paradise,

882
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,190
乌苏拉的父母去了希腊
when Ursula's Mater and Pater slift off to Greece,

883
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:04,260
度周末
for a long weekend...

884
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,840
至少我们以为是这样
Or so we thought.

885
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,340
乌苏拉
Ursula!

886
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,160
衣...衣服
Naked.

887
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,460
先生  女士
Sir! Madam!

888
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,220
我向你们保证 我们只是单纯的...
I assure you this is completely innocent...

889
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,730
双脚踝关节扭伤  一根肋骨骨折
Two sprained ankles, one cracked rib.

890
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,920
病历上的受伤原因写的是
Official cause of accident, listed on hospital form...

891
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,080
也有姑娘、泡妞的意思

892
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,080
猫咪
pussy.

893
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,520
她会不会还住在这里呢
What were the chances that she still lived in this house?

894
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,220
然后  她就出现了
And yet, there she was.

895
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:45,780
乌苏拉
Ursula.

896
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,320
为什么我从来没有回过她的电话或信件
Why had I never returned her calls or letters?

897
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:55,520
羞愧  怯懦  卡文迪许家族的特色
Shame, spinelessness, hallmarks of the Cavendish clan.

898
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,250
我意识到我可以选择
I realized I had a choice.

899
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,330
我可以偷偷逃走  继续我的计划
I could slink off and continue as planned,

900
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,240
或者大胆地走进那扇大门
or I could go boldly to the door,

901
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,680
看看我们还有没有希望
and discover what hope, if any, would lay within.

902
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,470
女祭司  快点来  是贝里家的女儿
Abbess, come quick, it's the Bailey girl.

医者说她撑不到日落前
Healer said she be gone by sundown.

907

不公平  可是无力回天
Ain't right, ain't fair, but nothing to be done.

908
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,950
千万不要动
Be very still.

909
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:46,090
能杀掉你的东西就在这

刚好可以炸开颈动脉

911
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,480
感觉怎么样
How does it feel?

01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,230
很好
Good.

913
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,800
凯金快死了
Catkin's dying!

914
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,910
-什么  -她不小心踩到了蝎子鱼
- What? - She trod on a scorpion fish.

915
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,720
你能救她
You can save her.

916
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,110
你包里的智能仪器 可以救她

先知委员会的特别指令
Prescient Councils swear by a special order.

919
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:44,300
要我不能遇事就把自己当做星美女神
Say I can't go play Lady Sonmi for every fate twisty wrong,

920
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:46,110
乱用机器  招惹是非
and click fingers, make right.

921
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,660
我只是个愚蠢的牧羊人
I just a stupid goat herder

922
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,550
要是我早知道你没有作为 要害死凯金的话
but I cog you're killin' Catkin by not actin',

923
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,950
我就该让你上了那座桥
just... by lettin' you up on that bridge,

924
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,060
被科纳族吃掉
you Kona meat.

925
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:00,170
如果躺在那备受煎熬的是先知呢
If a Prescient be layin', with poison meltin' her heart n'lungs?

926
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,100
如果是你的孩子呢
If it be your kin?

927
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,240
先知的生命就比谷民的更值钱吗
Why the Precient's life worth more than a Valleysman?!

928
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,210
我带你去毛娜索尔

但我觉得
better, I believed,

935
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,900
还是按弟弟的安排走更好
to stay the course set by dear brother Den.

01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:12,450
别碰我的东西  你这疯母牛
Leave my things alone, you pilvering cow.

973
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,700
你是新来的
Cause you're new,

974
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:18,300
我就不让你吃肥皂粉了
I shall not make you eat soap powder, this time...

975
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:19,880
先警告一次
You're warned.

976
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:22,690
在我们这里 我不能容忍任何冒犯的语言
I cannot stand for offensive language in our arrays,

977
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,960
任何人都不可以
not from anyone.

978
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:27,720
我从不吓唬人  卡文迪许先生  从不
And I never make idle threats, Mr. Cavendish. Never.

979
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,800
好像我喜欢跟你说话似的  你这个小偷
I'll talk to you as I ruddy will like, you thief!

980
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:35,110
让我吃肥皂粉  我倒想看看你有什么本事
Make me eat soap powder? I'd like to see you try.

981
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,130
见鬼
Ooh! Ooh, bloody hell!

982
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,510
一开始就这么扫兴
A disappointing start.

983
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:45,560
难道这是变态虐待旅馆吗
Is this some sort of kinky S&M hotel?

984
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,860
我是诺克斯护士  别惹我
I am nurse Noakes, you do not wish to cross me.

985
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:01,160
很抱歉让你久等了  你是...
I am so sorry to keep you waiting. Uh, I know it's a Miss...

986
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:01,970
雷
Rey.

987
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,800
路易莎·雷  《望远镜》杂志的
Luisa Rey, Spyglass magazine.

988
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,020
对  对
Right, right.

989
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,920
路易莎  这是乔·纳皮尔
Luisa, this is Joe Napier,

990
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,310
他是我们的安全主管
he's our security chief.

991
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,290
我很惊讶你会来采访
I was surprised to get your query.

992
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:15,390
别误会 你们杂志是很活跃  就是
I mean, don't get me wrong, it-it is a feisty magazine, but...

993
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,360
有任何需要  请别客气
Anything you need, sir, just let me know.

994
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,990
好的  这里没问题了  多谢
We'll do. Guys, I'm good, thank you very much.

995
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:20,870
谢谢  回见了
Thank you, see you.

996
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:23,420
我们的主编想要加一点爆料
Our editor's trying to spice things up a little bit,

997
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,770
他说公众需要更多实质性的内容  所以
he says the public wants more substance, so...

998
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,240
也许只是一时的狂热
Probably just a fad.

999
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:32,030
跟我来  从鸡场开始吧
Come on, follow me, let's start you with the Chicken Ranch.

1000
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:34,300
大脑壳们待的地方
That is where we keep the Eggheads.

1001
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:47,760
早啊  卡文迪许先生  今早感觉不错吧
Hello, Mr. Cavendish, feeling super this morning?

1002
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:49,600
才怪  我昨晚入住的时候
No. I checked in last night,

1003
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:52,140
还以为震蛋屋是一家旅馆
believing that Aurora House was a hotel.

1004
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,950
我弟弟替我预定的
My brother made the booking you see,

1005
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:56,020
是他的恶作剧吧
his idea of a practical joke.

1006
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:57,060
不过
But listen,

1007
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,440
还有个更大的问题
you have a bigger problem closer to home.

1008
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,910
有个自称诺克斯的疯女人
There's some demented bitch calling herself Noakes,

1009
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:07,920
在这里胡闹  假扮成女仆
rampaging about the place, impersonating a chamber maid.

1010
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,290
更重要的是  她打了我
But the point is this: she struck me,

1011
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,580
还偷走了我的钥匙
and she stole my keys.

1012
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,330
听到了吗  我要我的钥匙  立刻  马上
Right? I'll need those keys back, straight away.

1013
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,790
震蛋屋现在是你的家了
Aurora House is your home now,

1014
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,970
卡文迪许先生  你的签名
Mr. Cavendish. Your signature

1015
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:27,360
-授权我们使用  -签名
- authorizes us to apply... - Signature?

1016
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:30,170
你昨晚签过的监护文件
The custody document you signed last night.

1017
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:32,640
你的住宿文件
Your residency papers.

1018
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:36,190
不不不  那是旅馆的入住登记
Oh no, no, no. That was the hotel register.

1019
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,760
无所谓了  只是形式罢了  不是吗
Ah, never mind, it's all academic, huh?

1020
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:42,220
这回我可有故事讲了
This is gonna make a hell of a diner party story.

1021
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:45,820
大部分客人在第一天早上 都想回去
Most of our guests get cold feet on their first mornings.

1022
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,750
请把钥匙还给我
My keys, please.

1023
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,140
-房客们是不能  -我不是该死的房客
- Residents are not... - I'm not a ruddy resident!

1024
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,250
你会发现在震蛋屋乱发脾气是无济于事的
You'll find temper tantrums won't help you at Aurora House!

1025
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:57,170
你违背了该死的
You're breaking the... ruddy...

1026
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,260
监禁法案  还是什么鬼东西
acting... conservation act, or some ruddy thing,

1027
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,560
我不会向暴力犯罪行为屈服
and I will not be subjugated to a criminal abuse.

1028
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:13,080
我不会向暴力犯罪行为屈服
I will not be subjugated to criminal abuse.

1029
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:20,100
窗外
Outside,

1030
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:23,610
硕大的雪花一片片落在屋顶上
fat snow flakes are falling on slate roofs.

1031
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,840
亚历山大•索尔仁尼琴  诺贝尔文学奖作家

1032
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,840
就像索尔仁尼琴在付蒙特劳动
Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont,

1033
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,560
在流放中我该努力工作
I shall beaver away in exile.

1034
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:34,820
和索尔仁尼琴不同的是  我并不孤单
Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.

1035
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,790
要去什么地方吗
Off somewhere?

1036
01:08:45,610 --> 01:08:48,890
当然了  去现实世界
You bet I am. To the land of the living.

1037
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:57,980
《绿色食品》 1973年的美国科幻电影

1038
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:53,260
绿色食品是人做的
Soylent Green is people.

1039
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:57,980
绿色食品是人做的
Soylent Green is made of people!

1040
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,890
喂  回来
Oy! Get back here, you!

1041
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:06,890
离我远点  不然我就在警察局的报告中
You keep away from me, or I'll be forced to name you,

1042
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,110
把你写成共犯
in the police report, as an accomplice.

1043
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:10,810
我没空跟你胡闹
I have better things to do than this.

1044
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:15,170
那别闹啊  你这个该死的狗杂
Then go, pit and do them, you bloody sucker son of...

1045
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:18,050
够了
Right!

1046
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:26,570
放开你的手  你这个该死的
God, you take hands off me, you ruddy bloody...

1047
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,460
只要给人民一些东西
You can maintain power over people,

1048
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,610
就可以一直统治他们
as long as you give them something.

1049
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:35,030
夺走某个人的一切
Rob a man of everything,

1050
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,980
会失去对那个人的控制
and that man will no longer be in your power.

1051
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:38,960
亚历山大·索尔仁尼琴

你怎么知道他的
How do you know about him?

1055
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:49,690
海柱告诉我的
Hae-Ju.

1056
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:52,090
亚历山大·索尔仁尼琴

1057
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,100
不过
But...

1058
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,930
-张长官  -叫我海柱就好了
- Sir Zheng. - Please, you must call me Hae-Ju.

1059
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:58,570
海柱
Hae-Ju...

1060
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,530
我这样是要没命的
Fabricants can be excised for this...

1061
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,430
对啊  生存就是需要勇气的
Well, survival often demands some courage.

1062
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:26,770
知识是面镜子
Knowledge is a mirror,

1063
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:28,910
这是我人生中第一次
and for the first time in my life,

1064
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,790
有机会看到自己的过去
I was allowed to see who I was,

1065
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,930
还有未来
and who I might become.

1066
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:43,000
去打扫船头
Go clean the head.

1067
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:45,740
早上好  船长
Good morning, captain.

1068
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:49,540
胆小鬼 要是你滚开的话 早上就更美好了
You can help it remain so, old quail cock, by buggering off.

1069
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:51,930
恐怕我做不到
I'm afraid I can't do it, sir.

1070
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:55,830
不然的话 我就没法告诉你我在房间里发现了
If I was, i would be unable to inform you of the stow-away

1071
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:58,100
-偷渡客了  -偷渡客
- that I have discovered in my... - Stow-away?

1072
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:00,570
我向你保证  这个莫里奥里人是走投无路了
I assure you that this Moriori had no choice.

1073
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:03,420
刚才他发誓 说自己是一流的水手
Now he has sworn to me that he is a first class,

1074
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,530
要是给他一个机会的话
able bodied seaman,

1075
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:06,590
他可以凭本事挣旅费
capable of earning passage if only given a chance.

1076
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:09,460
偷渡就是偷渡
A stow-away is a stow-away,

1077
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,840
就算他能下金蛋也是偷渡
even if he shits silver nuggets.

1078
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,500
他向你解释过什么吗
Did he ever explain anything to you?

1079
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,550
他告诉我他们的目的
He told me their goal

1080
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:22,940
是创造有自由意志的人造人
was the creation of a free willed Fabricant.

1081
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,290
育娜失败了
Yoona had failed.

1082
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:29,490
我是他们最后的希望
I was their last hope.

1083
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,630
不得不说要是所有的女记者都像你一样
I have to say if all lady journalists look like you,

1084
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:41,490
我可能就支持妇女解放运动了
I might start to take this, uh, women's lib thing more seriously.

1085
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:44,930
当然欢迎您的支持
Well, I'm sure they can use your sort.

1086
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,230
很好
Nice.

1087
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:49,470
好了  你稍等一下
Okay, uh, you wait here

1088
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,920
我去找个机灵点的家伙
and I will go find someone smarter who can, uh,

1089
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,900
让他帮你解答一些细节问题
walk you through the details of some of your questions.

1090
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:54,880
好的
Right.

1091
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,410
卢夫斯·思科史密斯博士

1092
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:14,530
好吧
Okay...

1093
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:16,940
老爸会怎么做
What would Dad do?

1094
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,220
谁他妈的这么晚打电话
Who the bloody hell is this?

1095
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,730
你知道现在几点了吗
Have you any idea what time it is?

1096
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,500
-丹尼  是我  蒂姆  -蒂姆
- Denny, it's me, Tim. - Timothee?

1097
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,580
你在哪儿
Where are you?

1098
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,940
你应该很清楚我在哪里
Ah, I think you ruddy know about where I am.

1099
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,710
房客是不允许打电话的
But residents are denied access to phones.

1100
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,200
有人偷带电话进去吗
Someone smuggled one in?

1101
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,010
什么  你怎么知道这些规定的
What, you know the rules?

1102
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,910
因为是我帮他们起草的
I helped write them, Timmy.

1103
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,260
十二年前开始  我就成为震蛋屋的主要股东
I have been a principal investor in Aurora House for twelve years,

1104
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,520
没想到居然这么赚钱
it's incredibly lucrative.

1105
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,540
你想不到
You can't believe

1106
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,710
人们愿意花多少钱把父母关起来
what people would pay to lock-out their parents.

1107
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,740
丹  你已经找够乐子了吧
Look, Den, you've had your fun,

1108
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:00,180
我觉得游戏 你玩够了吧
I think it's high time you put an end to this little game of yours.

1109
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:04,910
不不不  蒂姆  我的游戏才刚开始
No, no, no, Timmy. My fun has just begun.

1110
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:06,380
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1111
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,150
我是你哥哥  你为什么要这样对我
I am your brother, why are you doing this to me?

1112
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:11,760
我觉得问题应该是
I think the better question is-would be,

1113
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:14,120
你干过什么才遭此报应
what have you done to deserve this?

1114
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,280
你是什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

1115
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,090
得了吧  你真淘气  别侮辱我了
Oh come, naughty old brother, don't insult me.

1116
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:21,570
你以为我不知道你和乔洁特的事吗
You can't think that I didn't know about you and Georgette!

1117
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,370
乔洁特
Georgette?

1118
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,660
丹...
Look, Den...

1119
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:31,750
我没想伤害你
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1120
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,390
现在忏悔晚了  蒂姆
I'm afraid your penance has come due, Timbo,

1121
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,600
该赎罪了
it's time to account for your crimes.

1122
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,030
丹...
Den...

1123
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:41,750
我...我很抱歉
I'm... I'm so, so sorry.

1124
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:44,030
不不不  没必要道歉
No no no, there's no need to apologize.

1125
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:46,570
流放你就是最好的赎罪
Your exile is more than enough reparation.

1126
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:51,200
你要是看到了诺克斯护士拿着扫帚
Oh, I do have my fingers crossed for a scenario involving you,

1127
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,290
不要忘了我正在这边 真心为你祈祷
nurse Noakes and a broom handle.

1128
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:55,350
祝你好运  蒂姆  再见
Cherry up, Timmy. Bye bye now.

1129
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,440
他向你问好
He sends his love.

1130
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,530
我想问问你被捕那晚的情况
I would like to ask about the night of your arrest.

1131
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:17,830
我记得  我听着他的心跳
I remember... listening to his heart beat.

1132
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:22,380
你的心脏比我们的跳得缓慢的多
Your heart beats much slower than ours.

1133
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,070
那声音里有种温情
There is a gentleness to the sound.

1134
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:29,780
我感觉很舒服
I find it... comforting.

1135
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:33,710
维维安  几点了
Vyvyan, what time is it?

1136
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:35,630
不知道  管它呢
I don't know. Who cares...

1137
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,760
我刚才听到了一段旋律  用小提琴的
I've heard a melody, boy. For violin.

1138
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:39,720
快点
Quick...

1139
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,860
找支笔
Find-find a pen.

1140
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:45,000
我在梦中听到的
I heard it in a dream.

1141
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:47,740
那是个噩梦般的咖啡店
It was in a nightmarish café...

1142
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:52,480
模糊而明亮的灯光  地下室  没有出口
Blurry, bright lights, but underground and no way out.

1143
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,800
女服务员们
And the waitresses...

1144
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,200
都长着同一张脸
they all had the same face.

1145
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:00,480
那里播放着音乐
There was music played,

1146
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,950
和我一生中听到的音乐都不同
not like any music I've ever heard in my life.

1147
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,930
开头是
It began...

1148
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:11,760
开头是
It began...

1149
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,190
等一下
Wait...

1150
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:19,030
刚才还记得一清二楚
It was so clear a minute ago.

1151
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,520
帮帮我  罗伯特  它要溜走了
Help me, Robert, help me. It's slipping away!

1152
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,250
我想不起来了
I've lost it.

1153
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,250
你会想起来的
It'll come to you, sir.

1154
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,470
你放弃寻找的时候  它却找上了你
The minute you stop trying to find it, it will find you.

1155
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,520
你太天真了  罗伯特
You are naive, Robert.

1156
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,000
一点也不
I am anything but.

1157
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:43,590
我们之间的鸿沟很深
There is a gulf between these chairs.

1158
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,650
我们的追求是一样的
What you want is no different from what I want.

1159
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,630
哪有什么鸿沟
The gulf is an illusion.

1160
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,820
我该如何描述那晚  思科史密斯
How do I describe that night, Sixsmith...

1161
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,850
维维安和我的共鸣  超越了语言
What had happened between Vyvyvan and I transcended language.

1162
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,780
那从他的眼中涌出
It was music that poured from his eyes,

1163
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,600
从他的唇间低吟而出的乐曲
and breathed from his lips.

1164
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:09,510
比我听过的任何音乐都美妙
Music as beautiful as any I have ever heard.

1165
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,890
你  你在干什么
What-what are you doing in here?

1166
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,450
他们找到我们了
They found us.

1167
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:54,330
我不会放手  看着我
I'll be with you the whole way, now focus on me.

1168
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,290
跟我走
Stay with me.

1169
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,880
就在这里  我不会放手的
Right here. I won't let you go.

1170
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:25,840
-尤因先生  -没...没事的
- Mr. Ewing. - It-It's alright.

1171
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:28,530
我和船长谈过了  他会听你说的
I-I talked to the captain, he'll hear your case.

1172
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,350
你叫什么  小伙子
What's your name, boy?

1173
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,250
奥图阿  先生
Autua, sir.

1174
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:37,050
这位一点不懂航海的基督徒
This Christian gentleman who knows nothing about ships,

1175
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,850
说你是一流的水手
tells me that you're a first-class sailor.

1176
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:44,900
来放下主帆  小子
Very well, let's see you'd lower the main top, son.

1177
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,210
罗德里克先生  我的瓶子空了
Mr. Roderick, my bottle is empty.

1178
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:06,410
波海威  准备好我的家伙
Boerhaave, ready my piece.

1179
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:10,800
什么  你答应过我的  船长
What? Sir, you... gave me your word, Captain.

1180
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:13,380
求你了  不要这么做
P-Please, you can't do this.

1181
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:17,390
别在我的船上对我指手画脚
Nobody tells me what I can and cannot do on my own ship.

1182
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:20,070
而且还是为了一个偷渡的黑鬼
Specially when it concerns nigger stow-away.

1183
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:49,590
船长  看啊  他脚趾上有鱼钩
Captain look! He's got fish-hooks for toes.

1184
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:52,760
波海威  别脏了我的甲板
Boerhaave, you don't make a mess of my deck.

1185
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,240
不要
No.

1186
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:17,620
海柱
Hae-Ju...

1187
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:29,360
船长  求你了
Captain, please...

1188
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,430
要是你能听我说  我...
Look, if you can just hear me, I'm...

1189
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:55,850
这黑鬼水性不错
The darkie's salt as I am.

1190
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,840
波海威先生
Mr. Boerhaave!

1191
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:03,760
看样子我们又多了一位船员
It appears we have an addition to our crew.

1192
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:05,490
盯住他别偷懒
Make sure he earns his keep.

1193
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,000
胡克先生
Mr. Hooks.

1194
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,580
找到她了  在化学实验室里
I found her. She was in the chem labs,

1195
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:14,920
她在找卫生间
looking for the bathroom.

1196
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,870
是吗  好的  那么
Ah? Well, perfect, then, uh,

1197
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:20,910
干脆你来接手吧  萨克斯
why don't you take over from here, Sachs,

1198
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:23,500
向雷小姐介绍一下我们的小组织
you know, introduce our little tribe, and uh...

1199
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,020
带她参观一下大楼
and guide Ms. Rey through the... through the tower.

1200
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:29,820
有意思的是  我本来不该在这里
The funny thing is, I am not even supposed to be here.

1201
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:32,310
我本来应该在首尔
I was meant to be in Seoul,

1202
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:34,960
不过因为空管罢工 航班延误了
but the air traffic controller strike put everything up,

1203
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:37,800
我今晚才走
so now I'm on the... time jumper tonight.

1204
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,950
你是否觉得全世界都在跟你作对
Did you ever think that the universe was against you?

1205
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:42,280
一向如此
All the time.

1206
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:44,810
介意吗
You mind?

1207
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:46,520
不介意
I'm cool.

1208
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,050
你看起来有点紧张  伊萨克
You seem nervous, Isaac.

1209
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,210
-我让你感到紧张吗  -没有
- Do I make you nervous? - No.

1210
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,160
实际上恰好相反
Actually, just the opposite.

1211
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,110
你会告诉我为什么掩护我吗
Will you gonna tell me why you covered for me?

1212
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:40,310
自由  我们的文明发出的无病呻吟
Freedom. The fatuous jingle of our civilization.

1213
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:42,740
只有那些被剥夺自由的人
But only those deprived of it

1214
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:45,810
才能对它略知一二
have the barest inkling of what it really is.

1215
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:07,500
该怎么处置你有些争议
There's much disagreement on what should be done with you.

1216
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:11,590
统治阶层想要以异类的罪名处你安乐死
The Corprocrats want you euthanased as a deviant,

1217
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:14,360
制造局要求对你进行一段时间的研究
the Manufacturer is demanding a period of study,

1218
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,180
心理学家则迫切要求
the Pyschogenomicists are

1219
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:19,290
对你的大脑进行解剖
screaming for an immediate cerebral vivisection.

1220
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:25,370
然而  你的案例是政治问题
However, the problem you create is a political one.

1221
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,580
也就是说归我管
Which means you are my problem.

1222
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:37,500
有意思  想象一下
I find it intriguing to imagine that beneath this...

1223
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,690
精心设计的外表下面
perfectly engineered features,

1224
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,940
藏着怎样的思想  能使整个统一体恐慌
are thoughts that terrify the whole of Unanimity.

1225
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:52,030
我不怕这些思想  因为我敢于直面事实
I'm not afraid of such thoughts, because I do not fear the truth.

1226
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:57,260
这个世界是有秩序的  人造人
There's a natural order to this world, fabricant.

1227
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,800
这秩序是必须要遵守的
And the truth is this order must be protected.

1228
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:18,600
通知档案保管员  准备剔除
Inform the Archivist, prepare for excisement.

1229
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,120
-遵命  长官  -长官
- Yes sir. - Sir...

1230
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:26,650
能告诉我张海柱怎么样了吗
Can you tell me what happened to Hae-Ju Zheng?

1231
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,340
据说死了
Killed, I was told.

1232
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:55,220
这些宴会啊  活动啊  亚当
All this feast and excitements, really Adam, it's...

1233
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,920
太累人了  你需要休息
all too much, you'll need to rest.

1234
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:13,140
我曾经...
I had...

1235
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,800
有一个女朋友
a girlfriend once,

1236
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:19,630
卡洛斯·卡司纳达  秘鲁裔美国作家

1237
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:19,630
她一直想让我看卡洛斯·卡司纳达的书
she kept trying to get me to read Carlos Castenada.

1238
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:22,620
-你读过吗  -读过
- You ever read any of that stuff? - Oh yeah.

1239
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:27,820
但我俩是没可能的
But the relationship was doomed.

1240
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:30,030
她只要一提
Every time she brought up a new...

1241
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:32,110
她那套因果报应的理论
karma, that sort of stuff,

1242
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,730
我就禁不住想笑
I-I couldn't stop myself from laughing.

1243
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:40,450
但是 我却没法解释
And yet i can't explain

1244
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:44,560
我知道打开那扇门之后的报应
that I knew when I opened that door...

1245
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:00,310
他们销毁了报告的大部分副本
They destroyed most of the copies of the report.

1246
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,360
大部分
Most?

1247
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:10,080
两难了  对吗
There's no good choice here, is there?

1248
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:15,180
如果帮你  我会失去工作 甚至更糟
If I help you, I close my job or worse,

1249
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,760
如果不帮  会有很多人...
If I don't, a lot of people...

1250
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:25,270
难以想象的可怕
And it will be worse than worse.

1251
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:29,280
你必须去做
You have to do

1252
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:32,810
你不能不做的事
whatever you can't not do.

1253
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,760
有什么东西追杀你吗  扎克里
Someone preying on you, Zachry?

1254
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:45,730
你真的不怕在山顶遇到老乔治吗
You really ain't fear about meeting Old Georgie on the summit?

1255
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,660
比起魔鬼我更担心天气
I'm more scare some about the weather than in the Devil.

1256
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:53,950
你说他不存在
You cog he's real?

1257
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,800
如果不是老乔治  是谁造成了大衰落
Who tripped the Fall, if not Old Georgie?

1258
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,010
要听真相吗
True-true?

1259
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:06,810
我们的先人
The Old Uns.

1260
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,630
这话毫无根据
That's just a rope of smoke.

1261
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,380
先人们拥有智慧
Old Uns got the Smart.

1262
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:15,320
他们能妙手回春  掌控生命
They mastered sick and seeds,

1263
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,520
他们能创造奇迹  翱翔天际
they make miracles and fly across the sky.

1264
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,630
没错  这是事实  但事实不止如此
True. All true. But they got something else.

1265
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:23,990
他们贪得无厌
A hunger in their hearts,

1266
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:26,510
这种贪欲比科技更可怕
a hunger that's stronger than all their Smart.

1267
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,080
贪欲  贪什么
Hunger? For what?

1268
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,260
贪得更多
A hunger for more.

1269
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:38,580
爱和恐惧这种信仰
Belief like fear or love

1270
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,220
是必须要了解的
is forced to be understood

1271
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:43,460
因为这信仰同相对论
as we understand the theory of relativity,

1272
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:45,440
或是测不准原则一样重要
and principles of uncertainty.

1273
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,250
这信仰决定了我们生活的轨迹
Phenomena that determine the course of our lives.

1274
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:55,850
昨天  我的生活是那样
Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction.

1275
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:02,690
今天  却完全变了样
Today, it is headed in another.

1276
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,670
昨天的我决不相信  今天的我会这么做
Yesterday, I believe I would never have done what I did today.

1277
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:05,620
半衰期  路易莎·雷的秘密  贾维尔·戈麦兹著

1278
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,500
有些力量能重置时间和空间
These forces that often remake time and space,

1279
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:17,130
能改变我们脑海中的未来
they can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be,

1280
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:19,170
它早在我们出生前就已存在
begin long before we are born,

1281
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:21,970
也会一直存在下去
and continue after we perish.

1282
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:32,450
我们的命运和抉择就如同量子轨迹
Our lives and our choices like quantum trajectories

1283
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:35,310
只有理解此刻  才能得知下一刻
are understood moment to moment

1284
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:40,340
每一次交叉  每一次相遇
at each point of intersection, each encounter,

1285
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,870
都预示着新的方向
suggest a new potential direction.

1286
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,060
命题
Proposition:

1287
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:53,300
我爱上了路易莎·雷
I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey.

1288
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:59,560
这可能吗  我才刚认识她  但是
Is this possible? I just met her, and yet

1289
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:06,100
却感觉她给我带来了重大的变化
I feel like something important has happened to me.

1290
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:17,980
就是它
That's it.

1291
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:21,110
这是我梦中的旋律
The music from my dream.

1292
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:07,080
这是我来你房间那晚  我梦里的曲子
This is from my dream, that night I came to your room.

1293
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:12,330
我脑海中的旋律  不知怎么传给了你
This is the music I heard in my head, somehow I gave it to you.

1294
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:14,520
这是我这几周创作的
I've been working on this piece for weeks now.

1295
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:19,470
应该是你睡梦中听到  融入梦境了吧
I suspect you heard it, and incorporated it into your dream.

1296
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:23,140
我把它命名为《云图六重奏》
I call it the Cloud Atlas Sextet.

1297
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:30,580
这显然是我们两个合作的
This is obviously the result of our collaboration.

1298
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,480
我相信  这首曲子
The Atlas, I believe,

1299
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:37,280
是我这一生最有价值的事
is the only thing I've done in my life that is of value.

1300
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:41,630
但我知道  如果没有遇见你
But I know I could not have written it,

1301
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:44,870
我不可能写出它
if I hadn't met you.

1302
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:47,140
有一整段乐章
There are whole movements

1303
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:49,650
都是我想着我们俩写出来的
in the Atlas that I've read imagining us,

1304
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:54,280
想象我们在不同的年代以不同的身份邂逅
meeting again and again, in different lives and different ages.

1305
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:55,240
没错
Yes.

1306
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,260
如此重要的事物
Something as important as

1307
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,640
不能说什么是你的  或是我的
this cannot be described as "Yours" Or "Mine",

1308
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,320
这是我们的
it is "Ours".

1309
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,370
我也是这么想的  维维安
That this is exactly how I feel, Vyvyan.

1310
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:36,910
对不起  我...
I'm sorry, I...

1311
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:41,610
-我以为...-你以为  你以为什么
- I thought... - You thought? You thought what?

1312
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:43,400
你以为我会跟你这只
That I might fancy a little

1313
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:47,590
小花蝴蝶来电吗
buggering from a fine young dandy like yourself?

1314
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:52,690
我去打包  明早就离开
I pack my bag, and be gone by morning.

1315
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:53,590
你不能走
You'll do no such thing,

1316
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:55,750
没有我的允许你不能离开
you'll leave only when I say you can leave.

1317
01:30:55,750 --> 01:31:00,270
你要继续创作维维安·艾瑞斯的《云图》
You will continue working on Vyvyan Ayrs' Cloud Atlas.

1318
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:03,390
等你把它写完  我再决定你的去留
When it is finished, then I will decide what you do with you.

1319
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:05,790
你没权力把我关在这里  我要走了
You can't keep me here! I'm leaving!

1320
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:07,430
你自己去创作吧
Good luck with your composing.

1321
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:09,390
我敢肯定你这糟老头
I'm sure a sterile old fuck like yourself

1322
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:12,580
还能写出不少没人听的音乐
is still capable of something completely unmemorable.

1323
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:17,080
你最好想清楚  罗伯特  想想名声
I suggest you think about this, Robert. Think about reputation.

1324
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:20,770
我们这社会中名声最重要
Reputation is everything in our society.

1325
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:25,560
你这被剥夺继承权的荡货名声早毁了
Yours, my disinherited reprobate, has expired.

1326
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:26,920
你以为我们这里
Did you not think that we would

1327
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:29,640
是来者不拒  不看背景的吗
inquire about someone living under our roof?

1328
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:32,810
马克拉斯亲笔写的  我引述一下
Mackerras himself wrote, and I quote:

1329
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,850
他是个男妓
"He is a prostitute

1330
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:37,900
在凯斯学院他就总和同性恋们私通
whose liaisons with perverts and sodomites

1331
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:42,820
事业和信仰早已被他抛在脑后
were common place in his brief and forgettable career at Caius.

1332
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:47,270
藏好值钱的东西  引述完毕
Lock up the silverware." End of quote.

1333
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:52,970
警告你  要是不经我允许离开
Be warned. Leave here without my consent,

1334
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:54,850
整个音乐圈的人
and all the musical society

1335
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:58,700
都会知道罗伯特·弗洛比舍的恶行
will know of the degenerate Robert Frobisher.

1336
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,090
从此以后
After that,

1337
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:06,200
不管你写的曲子多么伟大
even if you compose one of the greatest symphonies ever written,

1338
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:09,440
都没人愿意听
no one will hear it,

1339
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,580
因为没有人想和你扯上关系
because no one will want anything to do with you.

1340
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,790
我不会再丢下你了
I won't let you go again.

1341
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:03,110
我就知道他会来
I told you he'd come.

1342
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:05,690
有两件事很明确
Two things became clear.

1343
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,200
就算自尽
Hanging myself from Edinburgh's flagpole

1344
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,960
也好过让那老寄生虫
is preferable to letting that parasite

1345
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,040
霸占我的才华
plunder my talent a day longer.

1346
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,090
还有我必须完成六重奏
I must complete my sextet.

1347
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:15,380
在这里我无法创作
I can't do it here,

1348
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:17,570
所以今晚我准备逃走
so tonight I plan to make my escape.

1349
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:32,840
请停车接受扫描
Please stand by for vehicle scan.

1350
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,450
准许通行
Clearance granted.

1351
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:58,850
所有的越狱都有风险
Any jailbreak's a risky proposition.

1352
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,830
一个小闪失
One little cock-up,

1353
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,640
那个母老虎就要大发雷霆
and we are dangling at her majesty's pleasure.

1354
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,730
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

1355
01:34:05,790 --> 01:34:07,930
我们可以用代号
We could use code names,

1356
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:11,240
但我肯定是记不住的
but the truth is I'd probably be the first to forget mine.

1357
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:14,170
所以  卡文迪许先生
So, Mr. Cavendish...

1358
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:16,570
我是厄尼·布兰克史密斯
Ernie Blancksmith.

1359
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:21,580
这是米克斯先生  这是我女友维罗妮卡·科斯特罗
This is Mr. Meeks and my girl Veronica Costello.

1360
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,620
-敬信任  -敬信任
- To trust. - To trust.

1361
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:29,280
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

1362
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:32,430
这只鹦鹉呢
What about the parrot, then?

1363
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:35,230
这种人总爱打小报告
Forever those are likely songbird.

1364
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:38,370
米克斯先生是位值得尊敬的绅士
Mr. Meeks is a fine and honorable gentleman,

1365
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:40,080
他绝不会背叛我们
he would never betray us.

1366
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:43,320
而且  从来没人听他说过别的话
Besides, no one's ever heard him say anything else.

1367
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,430
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

1368
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,200
问题是  老家伙
Question is, old man,

1369
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:50,170
你够不够精明
think you're up to snuff?

1370
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,350
请配合统一体的工作
Unanimity requires compliance.

1371
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:10,360
红色安全警报  准备登机
We have a security code Red, prepare to be boarded.

1372
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,430
你打算怎么办
What are you going to do?

1373
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:14,990
保持冷静  冷静
Stay calm, stay calm.

1374
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:19,550
结局会很悲惨  你提醒过我
"It will end in tears." You've warned me.

1375
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:21,950
我想我就和亚当·尤因一样绝望
I suppose I'm as hopeless as Adam Ewing,

1376
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:25,470
说不出话来  只能平躺着等待
oblivious towards the unspeakable forms lying and waiting,

1377
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:27,710
对朋友毒害他的事实一无所知
blind to the fact his friend is poisoning him.

1378
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,110
请等一下...
Wait, please...

1379
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,940
一想到要失去这枚戒指我就很难过
The idea of losing this ring distresses me beyond measure.

1380
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,400
别犯傻  亚当
Don't be a silly puff here, Adam,

1381
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:37,080
为了救命取下戒指  你妻子能理解的
I'm sure your wife will set your health above a golden loop.

1382
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:42,190
我见过这病初期的浮肿  一点也不好看
I have seen the onset for dropsy and it is not a pretty sight!

1383
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:46,210
我认识一个出色的西班牙金匠
I know an excellent Spanish goldsmith,

1384
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:47,510
他的手艺棒极了
who works with such alacrity,

1385
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:49,980
你家蒂尔达也许都看不出你摘下过它
that your Tilda may not have to know this was ever removed.

1386
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,030
把它给我
Give it to me!

1387
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:55,450
你他妈别碰我的布丁
Get your fucking hands off my pudding!

1388
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:58,570
这不是你的布丁  你个老年痴呆
It's not your pudding, you Alzheimer riddled lout!

1389
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:00,030
你的已经吃完...
You've already eaten...

1390
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:08,700
来这边
Better get in here.

1391
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,030
卡文迪许先生
Mr. Cavendish!

1392
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,860
这个房间撒发着药臭味
The room stank of bitter medicine.

1393
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,440
枪真是有趣  这么有分量
Curiously heavy things, guns.

1394
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,020
我到底为什么拿起它
Why did I take it, exactly?

1395
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:56,820
我说不清
Can't say.

1396
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,320
是直觉
An intuition.

1397
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,300
非常重要的直觉
A sense of significance.

1398
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,250
从这一刻起
That from this point on

1399
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:07,610
再也没有回头路
there was no going back.

1400
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:29,310
山顶看起来还在云中  我们没时间了
Just seeing them clouds, we run out of time.

1401
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:33,710
不
Nay.

1402
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:39,030
-我不要系高科技绳子  -不行  你要是掉下来
- Don't need no smart rope. - Yeah. See you fall,

1403
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:41,050
我能拉住你
I catch you.

1404
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:00,450
举起手  快点  出来  下车
Hands in the air. Now! Move it, step off of the vehicle!

1405
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:03,930
下来  下来  快点
Get down. Down, now!

1406
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:09,660
去你的移民鸟语
Fuckin' migrant monkey-talk.

1407
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:12,450
为什么要雇这种滑头
Why do they hire these greasy subs?

1408
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:15,600
否认  长官  确定违法
Negative, sir. Definite illegal.

1409
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,890
你控制住他
You turn him from now.

1410
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:19,160
我发现另一生命体
I'm reading a second life form!

1411
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:20,870
-在哪  -车里
- Where? - In the truck.

1412
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:22,630
-去看看  -是的  长官
- Check it out. - Yes, sir.

1413
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:59,240
你踏入了魔鬼的领地
You trodding on the Devil's ground now,

1414
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,870
山谷人
Valleysman.

1415
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:09,280
我只说一次  那个外乡人不能去山顶
I'm saying just once. That off-lander ain't getting to the top.

1416
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:14,530
你该放开绳子了
Time for you to let go that rope.

1417
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:15,890
擅闯入者
You trespass

1418
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:18,830
必付代价
you pay the price.

1419
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:22,860
现在  放开绳子
Now drop that rope.

1420
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:26,560
放开绳子
Drop that rope.

1421
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:31,390
-突击员1  进入车内  -收到
- Forcecom 1, entering the truck. - Roger that.

1422
01:39:31,390 --> 01:39:32,600
我打开图像
I turn in visual.

1423
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:36,990
-是她  -没问题  对吧
- It's her! - It'll be okay, uh?

1424
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,230
遭到袭击  遭到袭击
Fire on me. Fire on me!

1425
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:14,350
你是什么人
Who are you?

1426
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:16,670
张海柱中校
Commander Hae-Ju Zheng.

1427
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:20,630
反抗联盟首席科学官
First science officer of the Union rebellion.

1428
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,330
你为什么这么做
Why are you doing this?

1429
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:27,190
因为我相信你有改变世界的力量
Because I believe you have the power to change this world.

1430
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:33,720
放开绳子  松开绳子
Drop that rope. Let go that rope.

1431
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:35,870
双手流血勿松手
"Hands are bleeding, can't let go"

1432
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:40,950
双手流血勿松手
Hands are bleeding. Can't let go.

1433
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,040
谢谢你  扎克里
Thank you Zachry.

1434
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:58,810
你救了我两次了
You saved me twice, ain't ya?

1435
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:01,680
你掉下来  我拉住你
You fall, I catch you.

1436
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:46,850
杀伤性武器确认
Excessive force confirmed.

1437
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:51,980
阻止他们  快阻止他们
Stop them. Stop them now.

1438
01:42:06,350 --> 01:42:10,080
你在干什么  孩子  没听懂我的话吗
What are you doing, boy? I thought I made myself clear.

1439
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:14,000
-我要走了  你请便吧  -很好  弗洛比舍
- Do what you want. I'm leaving! - Fine, Frobisher...

1440
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,700
走吧  但留下这个
Go, but I take this.

1441
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:19,210
-把它给我  -这是我的
- Give that to me. - It's mine!

1442
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:20,300
我警告你
I'm warning you!

1443
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,430
考虑到我们现在的关系
Under the conditions of this relationship,

1444
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:25,620
这是我的合法权利
I'm certain that I'm in my legal rights.

1445
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:27,560
把它给我  把它给我
Give it to me. Give it to me,

1446
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:29,680
不然我现在就杀了你  我发誓
or I swear to God I will kill you as you stand!

1447
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:35,010
拜托  你是个懦夫
Please you're a coward.

1448
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:38,040
-我会开枪的  -你不会的
- I'll do it. - You won't pull that trigger.

1449
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,270
你这种人永远不会
Your kind never does.

1450
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:07,360
亚当·尤因太平洋日记

1451
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:26,510
没事的  没事的
Yes. Yes, well...

1452
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:30,360
今天感觉如何  亚当
How-how fares our worm today, Adam?

1453
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:34,180
恐怕我快撑不住了
I'm afraid it has taken the best of me.

1454
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,680
不不不  胡说  胡说
Oh no no no. Nonsense. Nonsense.

1455
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:40,840
你不能放弃  想想你美丽的妻子
You mustn't give up. You must think of your beautiful wife.

1456
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:43,330
想想蒂尔达
You must think of Tilda.

1457
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:06,640
他们被困在下面  我们追上了
They're trapped in the downway. We've got them.

1458
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:19,760
你要干什么
What are you doing?

1459
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:35,920
快来  快点进去
Come on. Come on, get in there.

1460
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:22,060
不  死人从来都不安分
Nay, the dead never stay dead.

1461
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:30,240
仔细聆听  他们一直喋喋不休
Open your ears, and they'll never stop a yibberin'.

1462
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,640
这是什么地方
What is this place?

1463
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:49,660
大衰落之前
Before the Fall,

1464
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:53,760
先人们在太空  在群星间
Old Uns built dwellins,

1465
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:57,500
建造了很多定居地
beyond the sky, among the stars,

1466
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:03,190
这里是连通两地的枢纽
this place joined here with there.

1467
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:13,870
星美
Sonmi.

1468
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:21,380
是她
It is she.

1469
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:25,190
先人也像山谷人一样向星美祈祷吗
The Old Uns pray to Sonmi same as Valleysmen?

1470
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:30,630
不  不完全一样
Nay, not exactly same.

1471
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:58,250
跟紧点  人造人在这里常被抓走
Stay close. Fabricants get snatched here.

1472
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:02,610
-很安全  -谢谢
- All clear. - Thank you.

1473
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:04,580
不客气  我们是伙伴
No sweat, we're partners.

1474
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,360
但你得告诉发生了什么
But you got to tell me what's happening.

1475
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:08,380
好的  等我换掉这些衣服  报过警
Okay, let me take off these clothes, call the cops,

1476
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:11,100
我保证早上全都告诉你
and I promise I tell you everything that happen in the morning.

1477
01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:13,500
好的  但希望你能意识到
Okay. But I hope you realize you just said exactly

1478
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,610
悬疑故事里的人物被杀前说的话
what every character in any decent mystery says

1479
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:17,500
和你说的一模一样
right before they get killed.

1480
01:47:17,570 --> 01:47:19,000
晚安  贾维尔
Good night, Javier.

1481
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:05,090
你刚才的话是什么意思  那个...
What'd you mean down there? About...

1482
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:10,480
先人向星美的祈祷和山谷人不太一样
The Old Uns and Valleymen praying to Sonmi not exactly the same?

1483
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:15,500
先人  他们不同
Old men they were different.

1484
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,990
不同
Different?

1485
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:19,800
怎么不同
How?

1486
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:24,620
你想知道真相吗
You want the True-true?

1487
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,680
这是你住的地方吗
This is where you live?

1488
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:43,130
这是联盟诞生的地方
This is where Union was born.

1489
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:53,180
星美不是神
Sonmi was no God.

1490
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:55,510
她几百年前就死了
She died hundreds of years ago

1491
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:59,080
在一个遥远的半岛  现在那里已是死地
on a faraway peninsula, deadlanded now.

1492
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:01,090
什么
What?

1493
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,040
我知道山谷人的信仰
I cog Valleysmen's beliefs,

1494
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,760
我知道女祭司教导你们星美是神迹
I know Abbess teach you Sonmi was a miracle,

1495
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:07,400
她是智慧之神达尔文的孩子
birthed of Darwin god of Smart,

1496
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,670
但这不是真相
but ain't the True-true.

1497
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:13,670
她的生活很悲惨  充满了背叛
Her life was sad and judased,

1498
01:49:13,670 --> 01:49:15,940
她为了改变先人的思想而献身
she died trying to change the Old-Uns thinking.

1499
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:21,020
说谎  全是谎言
Lies. Nothing but lying.

1500
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:23,920
不  不  你在说谎
Nay, nay you, you're lying.

1501
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:38,690
我们不朽生命的天性在于...
The nature of our immortal lives is in the...

1502
01:49:38,690 --> 01:49:40,010
星美
Sonmi?

1503
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:43,970
她临死前  说出了自己的所作所为
Before she died, she spoke of her acts and deeding.

1504
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:46,370
她的话语能拯救心灵
Her words are heart saving blessing,

1505
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:48,200
提醒着我什么才是真实
reminding me what's the True-true.

1506
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,380
你还要听多久
How long you listen to this?!

1507
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:52,470
还要傻站这里多久
How long you just stand there,

1508
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:53,720
纵容这个陌生人
and let a stranger keep

1509
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:57,810
反复践踏你的信仰
fugging your beliefs up n' down, in n' out!

1510
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:01,410
我们的生命并不属于我们自己
Our lives do not belong to us,

1511
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,450
从出生到死亡  我们都与他人紧密相连
from womb to tomb, we're bound to others.

1512
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:07,970
扎克里
Zachry.

1513
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:10,470
你还好吧
You alright?

1514
01:50:12,090 --> 01:50:13,530
你继续
Finish your session...

1515
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:23,710
如果我想杀你  你早就死了
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

1516
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:28,090
我不会伤害你  我只是想谈谈
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just want to talk.

1517
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,760
冷静  好吗
Be cool. Alright.

1518
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:37,410
如果我想杀你  你也已经死了
And if I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.

1519
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:41,520
有你这么搭讪的吗
How's it feel, uh? Good conversation start, isn't it?

1520
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:47,100
你是莱斯特·雷的女儿  绝对没错
You are Lester Rey's daughter, that's for goddamn sure.

1521
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:50,990
-你认识我父亲  -朝鲜战争时
- You knew my father? - Korean War.

1522
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:53,350
我在2-1排
I was in the two-one.

1523
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:58,070
最边上那个是我  在你爸旁边
That's me on the end, next to your dad.

1524
01:50:58,290 --> 01:51:00,960
星球画报  记者拯救整个排

1525
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:01,360
炮弹在我身边爆炸  几乎把我炸飞
Mortar landed so close it could have dropped out of my ass.

1526
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:04,980
要不是你父亲  我不可能有今天
If your father hadn't done what he did, I wouldn't be here.

1527
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:12,370
我也是啊
Guess that makes two of us.

1528
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:24,130
你不愿放开绳子
You ain't let go that rope

1529
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:30,040
因为你看上了这个邪恶的小妞
cause you are lusting for that darkly, sweet meat.

1530
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,100
现在我明白了
I cog it all, now.

1531
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:38,370
这个椰子肤色的婊子  带着狡猾的面具
This whore, with her cokeynut skin, and her slywise mask,

1532
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:40,700
微笑着骗取你的信任
smiling and worming her way into your trust

1533
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,310
让你带她到这来
so you bring her here,

1534
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:46,590
她在追寻什么
scaving and sivving for what?

1535
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:48,390
探求什么  笨蛋
For what, fool?

1536
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:54,350
他们想要这个岛  先知想占领这里
They want the island. The Prescients want it all.

1537
01:51:54,350 --> 01:52:00,180
你为了一个妞出卖了你的同族
You judasing your kin for a piece of ass.

1538
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:02,640
她不是你的同伴  你们连肤色都不同
She ain't your tribe, she ain't even your color,

1539
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:05,640
她无视你们的传说和习俗
she just about ignoring all your yarns and ways,

1540
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:08,080
滔滔不绝地编造她的谎言
spinning and spouting her whoahsomse lies,

1541
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,890
你却轻信于她  你真该死
and you lap it up, you dammit!

1542
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:14,000
-那不是真的  -是吗  那就阻止她
- That ain't truth. - Ain't it? Then do something, stop her!

1543
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,700
拿出你的匕首割断她的喉咙
Take your spiker and slit her throat!

1544
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:22,390
保护你的族人  你的妹妹还有凯特金
Protect your tribe, protect your sister, little Caktin,

1545
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:25,280
杀了她  不然就晚了
kill her now, before it's too late!

1546
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:31,090
他们会杀了你
They will kill you.

1547
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:34,810
-我比你更了解他们  -是吗
- You don't know these people like I do. - Yeah?

1548
01:52:35,090 --> 01:52:37,120
如果你只是想跟我说这个
Well if that's all you came to tell me,

1549
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,280
那么你来晚了
you're a little bit late.

1550
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:42,360
有人刚把我撞下了天鹅颈桥
Somebody just forced me off the Swannekke bridge.

1551
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,960
局面失控了
This is out of control.

1552
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:51,180
你知道是谁干的吗
Do you know who did it?

1553
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:54,060
自称比尔·斯莫克的雇佣杀手
The contractor calls himself Bill Smoke.

1554
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:56,560
-而且...  -什么
- And... - What?

1555
01:52:58,270 --> 01:52:59,540
他杀了萨克斯
He got Sachs.

1556
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,510
伊萨克
Isaac?

1557
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:03,030
他的飞机上有炸弹
A bomb on his plane.

1558
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:06,910
媒体在谴责巴勒斯坦解放组织
The press is blaming the PLO.

1559
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:13,870
他是个威胁  就像思科史密斯  你也是
He was a threat. Like Sixsmith, like you.

1560
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:23,200
放他们过去
Bring them through.

1561
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:38,280
星美451  很荣幸见到你
Sonmi 451, I'm most honored to meet you.

1562
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:42,230
我是安可·阿皮斯将军  联盟的领导人
I am General An-Cor Apis, leader of Union.

1563
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:45,190
谁雇的他们
Who is paying them?

1564
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:47,840
雇我的人
The same guy that pays me.

1565
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:49,910
劳埃德·胡克
Lloyd Hooks?

1566
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,570
休斯·派克咨询公司
Hughes & Pikes Consulting.

1567
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:54,800
我听说过他们
I've heard of them.

1568
01:53:55,530 --> 01:53:59,190
他们为石油公司游说
They're lobbiers for oil companies.

1569
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:03,000
为什么大型石油公司
Why would big oil

1570
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:08,010
要雇劳埃德·胡克经营核反应堆
hire Lloyd Hooks to run a nuclear reactor?

1571
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:13,580
你这表情和你父亲的一样
You get that same look your father used to get.

1572
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:15,140
我就说吧
You see I told you.

1573
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,810
胡克不希望别人发现报告
Hooks doesn't want the report discovered,

1574
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:21,260
因为他不希望反应堆修好
because he doesn't want the reactor fixed.

1575
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,980
他想让它失败
He wants it to fail.

1576
01:54:23,290 --> 01:54:25,960
这关系到国家能源的未来
This is about the future of energy in this country.

1577
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:30,710
他们希望发生爆炸  混乱和死亡
They want the explosion. The chaos and carnage.

1578
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:33,430
死的人越多越好
The more deaths, the better.

1579
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:48,570
我不明白  你的话像黄蜂一样刺痛着我
Can't cog of thing, words and worries are like a wasp's nest,

1580
01:54:48,570 --> 01:54:50,330
让我心烦意乱
poked and prodded by you.

1581
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:54,090
你闯入我们的生活  反复念叨真相
You come elbowing in our life, yibbering about the True-true,

1582
01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:56,500
却又不愿意全说出来
and never telling the whole true.

1583
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,450
我要知道你到底在干什么
I need to cog what you doing!

1584
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:01,980
我告诉过你  我是来请求帮助的
I told you. I come to send a plea of help.

1585
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,520
帮助  为什么
Help, why?

1586
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:06,730
为了夺取我的家园  杀害并奴役我们吗
To steal our land? To kill n' slave us all?!

1587
01:55:06,730 --> 01:55:08,030
你想要什么
What do you want?!

1588
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:21,760
先知的日子不多了  扎克里  像凯金一样
Prescients are dying, Zachry. Just like Catkin.

1589
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:25,260
这个世界毒害着我和我的族人
This world poison me and all my kin.

1590
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,790
我们很无助  再不想办法就会失去家园
We get no help, ain't no home if I don' find a way.

1591
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:33,160
我说的是真的  我们要灭亡了
I say the truesome. We not survive.

1592
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:35,760
我们要灭亡了
We not survive.

1593
01:55:39,780 --> 01:55:41,590
艾瑞斯派人来追踪我了
Ayrs has the dogs after me.

1594
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:45,870
子弹虽然击中了他  却只伤到了胃
The bullet passed through, killing little more than his appetite,

1595
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:49,450
他想要血债血偿  我不得不付出代价
and he's out for blood. I'll have to pay the piper.

1596
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:53,180
-我应该报警  -没用的
- I should call the cops. - It won't help.

1597
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:56,600
我怎么知道你不是在骗我
How do I know you're not lying to me?

1598
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:58,480
斯莫克一发现我在跟你合作
Smoke will be coming for me,

1599
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,400
马上就会来找我
as soon as he figures out I'm with you.

1600
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:02,550
我们需要那份报告
We need that report.

1601
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:05,470
没有它我保不了你多久
I can't protect you for long without it.

1602
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:09,910
-阿皮斯将军...  -亲爱的
- General Apis... - You, my dear,

1603
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:13,470
你证明了我们的努力没有白费
are proof our efforts were not in vain.

1604
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:16,700
但我只是个服务员
But I'm just a dinery server.

1605
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:19,750
我生来就没法改变现实
I was not genomed to alter reality.

1606
01:56:20,110 --> 01:56:22,630
革命家也都不是天生的
No revolutionary ever was.

1607
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:28,500
对不起
I'm sorry.

1608
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:31,940
我没法满足你的要求
I cannot do what you're asking.

1609
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:38,370
这对任何人都是个艰难的选择
It would be a difficult choice for anyone.

1610
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:44,250
但是  在你最终决定前
But, before you call your decision final,

1611
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:47,460
我想让你看点东西
there is one last thing I would like you to see,

1612
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:51,680
让你了解一下我们在抗争什么
in order to fully understand what we are fighting for.

1613
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:14,110
祈求好运吧
Cross your fingers n' toes.

1614
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:05,260
如果你的愿望实现
If your pray' be answered,

1615
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:09,260
先知们再也不会来山谷了吗
nay Prescients never return to the Valley again?

1616
01:58:13,370 --> 01:58:17,560
想和我们一起走的  我们热烈欢迎
Those wishing to come with us, they're welcome.

1617
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:21,720
山谷是我的家
The Valley is my home.

1618
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:10,990
你没事吧
Are you alright?

1619
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:15,420
我知道这是禁止的
I know it is forbidden.

1620
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:51,370
思科史密斯  每天清晨我登上苏格兰纪念碑
Sixsmith. I climb the steps of the Scot monument every morning.

1621
01:59:51,870 --> 01:59:53,660
一切就变得明朗起来
And all becomes clear.

1622
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:57,050
真希望能让你看到这光明
Wish I could make you see this brightness.

1623
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:00,880
别担心  一切都好
Don't worry, all is well.

1624
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:04,830
一切都好到不能再好
All is so perfectly, damnably well.

1625
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:08,390
我现在明白了
I understand now,

1626
02:00:08,630 --> 02:00:13,190
噪音和音乐之间的界限只是陈规
that boundaries between noise and sound are conventions.

1627
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:21,420
所有界限都是陈规  等着被打破
All boundaries are conventions, waiting to be transcended.

1628
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:27,050
只有敢去想
One may transcend any convention,

1629
02:00:27,170 --> 02:00:30,260
才能打破陈规
if only one can first conceive of doing so.

1630
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:37,470
在这样的时刻
Moments like this,

1631
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:41,370
我能清楚地感知到你的心跳
I can feel your heart beating as clearly as I feel my own,

1632
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:45,110
亦知你我的分离只是种幻觉
and I know that separation is an illusion.

1633
02:00:52,290 --> 02:00:56,260
我的生命远远超越了自我的局限
My life extends far beyond the limitations of me.

1634
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:18,330
风暴要来了  尤因先生  我们下去吧
Storm is coming, Mr. Ewing. Gonna get you down below.

1635
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:24,780
我他妈不是做慈善的  给我滚  滚蛋
I'm not running a fuckin' charity, out with you! Off you go!!

1636
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:30,190
尤因先生  跟您说句话行吗
Aah, Mr. Ewing! A-a-a word if you may.

1637
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:34,870
这年头世道险恶啊  关于那丑闻
Dangerous times we have here. About that scandal.

1638
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:39,850
据说那法外之徒罗伯特·弗洛比舍竟是个作曲家
They say that ruffian Robert Frobisher is a composer.

1639
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:45,290
你也是个作曲家吧
You're a composer too, aren't you Mr. Ewing?

1640
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:49,140
-你想怎样  -警察原本要搜我的旅馆
- What d'you want? - The constable asked to search my rooms.

1641
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:51,640
我明白你在努力工作
I know how hard... you're working,

1642
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:55,360
所以我告诉他们三楼没人
so I told him there's no one on the third floor.

1643
02:01:55,570 --> 02:02:00,200
单为你空出三楼得花不少钱
It costs quite a bit of money to keep an entire floor empty.

1644
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:11,460
我只有这么多
That's all I have.

1645
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:20,560
多漂亮的小马甲啊
What a beautiful... waistcoat.

1646
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:24,230
如果这些信并不重要
If these letters aren't important,

1647
02:02:24,580 --> 02:02:26,670
-你干嘛还翻来覆去读  -我不知道
- why do you keep reading them? - I don't know.

1648
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:31,410
我只是  试着去搞清楚罢了
Maybe I'm... just trying to understand something.

1649
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:33,830
搞清楚什么
What?

1650
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:40,140
为什么我们总是犯同样的错误
Why we keep making the same mistakes, over and over.

1651
02:02:41,070 --> 02:02:43,980
也许你该去问...梅根
Maybe you should ask... Megan.

1652
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:47,060
-你说什么  -你认识叫梅根的吗
- What? - Do you know a Megan?

1653
02:02:47,470 --> 02:02:50,110
那是他的侄女  你从哪儿知道的
That's his niece. How do you know that?

1654
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:54,440
他似乎寄给过她一些东西
Looks like he mailed something to her.

1655
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:57,290
可能用了原来装这些信的信封
Probably used the envelope he was keeping letters in.

1656
02:03:00,610 --> 02:03:03,350
拜托  路易莎  写神秘小说的第一准则是
Come on, Luisa. First rule of mystery writing:

1657
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:06,050
一条有用的线索总会带出另一条
a good clue always leads to another clue.

1658
02:03:06,730 --> 02:03:09,810
当"蒂莫西·卡文迪许的受难记"
When "The Ghostly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"

1659
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:11,760
要被拍成电影时
is turned into a film,

1660
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:14,200
我所设想的男主角
I'm thinking for the role of the hero,

1661
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:17,030
要有劳伦斯·奥利弗的感觉[著名英国男演员]
one part Sir Laurence Olivier

1662
02:03:17,030 --> 02:03:19,250
还要有点像迈克尔·凯恩[同上]
with a dash of Michael Caine.

1663
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:21,050
你到底是谁
Who the hell is this?

1664
02:03:21,050 --> 02:03:23,930
震蛋屋的康威医生  我替阿沃医生的班
Dr. Conway, Aurora House, I'm covering for Dr. Upward.

1665
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:27,360
-是我妈的事情吗  -是的  霍奇克斯先生
- Ooh, is this about mother? - Yes, it is, Mr. Hotchkiss

1666
02:03:27,370 --> 02:03:28,830
你得做好心理准备
I-I'm afraid you must steel yourself,

1667
02:03:28,830 --> 02:03:31,390
她可能撑不过今晚了
I don't think that she's gonna last the night.

1668
02:03:31,390 --> 02:03:33,630
很不巧  这个时间不太凑巧
Unfortunately, it is an unconvenient time for us,

1669
02:03:33,630 --> 02:03:36,140
我们必须现在来吗
do we really need to come right now?

1670
02:03:36,590 --> 02:03:40,290
不  当然不用  不过她倒是特别提到你
No no, of course not, but she did ask for you specifically,

1671
02:03:40,290 --> 02:03:43,310
她好像对遗嘱不太满意
and she seems quite upset about her last will.

1672
02:03:46,950 --> 02:03:48,400
我这就来
I'll be right there.

1673
02:03:58,820 --> 02:04:01,840
整个计划就像推倒一串多米诺骨牌
The plan was a series of toppling dominoes,

1674
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:02,680
倒的第一张牌
that had commenced with

1675
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:06,090
就是厄尼告诉诺克斯护士我的死讯
Ernie announcing my death to nurse Noakes.

1676
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:08,630
-我知道  我知道  -嘘
- I know, I know. - Shhh!

1677
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:14,080
行动成功的关键在于  米克斯得闭上嘴
The entire ambush hinged upon the silence of Mr. Meeks.

1678
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:16,200
-我知道  我知道  -嘘
- I know, I know. - Shh!

1679
02:04:20,940 --> 02:04:22,430
卡文迪许先生
Mr. Cavendish?

1680
02:04:24,070 --> 02:04:25,310
一切都好吗
Everything alright?

1681
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:31,440
-别丢下我  -嘘
- Don't leave me here. - Shh.

1682
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:47,610
卡文迪许先生
Mr. Cavendish?

1683
02:04:53,230 --> 02:04:54,930
我就知道没这种好事
I knew it! It was too good to be true!

1684
02:04:54,930 --> 02:04:56,940
你这臭婊子
You cantankerous witch!

1685
02:04:57,020 --> 02:04:58,310
霍奇克斯先生  你母亲
Mr. Hotchkiss, your mother

1686
02:04:58,310 --> 02:05:01,220
是我最好的朋友  请快点
is my dearest friend here. Do please hurry.

1687
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:07,770
那么  再见
And so... adieu!

1688
02:05:07,870 --> 02:05:10,360
在法文里的意思是
Which translated literally from the French means

1689
02:05:10,370 --> 02:05:12,350
向上帝
"To commend before...

1690
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,100
称颂你
God"!

1691
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:24,690
乔·纳皮尔在1号线  胡克先生  他说有急事
I have Joe Napier on Line 1, Mr. Hooks. He said he can't wait.

1692
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:29,490
拜托  乔  我要迟到了  什么事
For God sake, Joe, I am late already. What's up?

1693
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:32,090
那叫雷的记者打来电话
I got a call from that reporter. Rey...

1694
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:36,210
她问起思科史密斯的事情
She was asking about Sixsmith.

1695
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:37,230
我明白了
I see.

1696
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:39,340
你说过她不会纠缠不休的
You said she wasn't gonna be a problem.

1697
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:45,030
有些人就是那么难缠啊  乔
Well, some problems are more resilient than others, Joe.

1698
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:50,560
-该死的钥匙呢  -他没留在钥匙孔里
- Where's the ruddy key? - He didn't leave it in the ignition!

1699
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:52,650
他老婆开的车  在她那儿
His wife was driving, she took it,

1700
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:55,370
那该死的女人拿走了钥匙
the ruddy female took the key in with her!

1701
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:58,150
我的老天爷啊  这下可怎么办
Oh Sweet Saint Ruddy Jude, what do we do now?

1702
02:05:58,150 --> 02:06:00,160
看看遮阳板下面有没有
Look! Under the sunflap.

1703
02:06:02,050 --> 02:06:03,070
太棒了
Yes!

1704
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:06,040
这是什么玩意儿
What is it?

1705
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:07,510
这不是钥匙  该怎么用它啊
It's not a key, what'd you do with it?

1706
02:06:07,510 --> 02:06:09,950
-不是钥匙还能是什么  -那怎么用呢
- What else could it be? - Well, how does it work?

1707
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:14,380
-妈的  -不好了
- Shite! - Oh no!

1708
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:16,150
想点办法  你是天才啊
Well, think of something, you're the genius,

1709
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:18,060
你他娘的可是个天才啊
you're the ruddy, ruddy genius!

1710
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:21,650
我们完蛋了
We're done for.

1711
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:34,010
老天  真不敢相信我要这么做
Oh boy. I can't even believe I'm going to do this.

1712
02:06:35,290 --> 02:06:38,100
这东西有用吗  还开着吗  能听到我吗
Is this thing working? I mean is it still on, can you hear me?

1713
02:06:38,210 --> 02:06:39,690
继续走别停下
Just keep walking.

1714
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:48,260
我觉得他上钩了
I think he's buying me.

1715
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:51,880
无论如何也别回头看
Whatever you do, don't look back.

1716
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:56,890
滚出我的车
Get out of my car!

1717
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:07,210
使劲按那按钮
Press that button thru!

1718
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:13,970
太好了
Yes! Yeees!

1719
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:23,500
糟糕  是米克斯  他也想来
Oh no, it's Mr. Meeks, he does want to come.

1720
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:29,330
这叫什么事儿啊
Ruddy bloody hell!

1721
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:33,250
我为人人  人人为我吗
All for one and one for all?

1722
02:07:48,990 --> 02:07:49,970
看住大门
The gate!

1723
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,890
维罗妮卡  帮米克斯开个车门好吗
Veronica, would you unlock the door for Mr. Meeks.

1724
02:07:56,810 --> 02:07:59,590
米克斯先生  我们去午夜自驾游呢
Hello Mr. Meeks, we're out for a nighttime drive.

1725
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:01,570
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

1726
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:10,360
-全速前进  -好兴奋呀
- Ramming speed! - Oh, how thrilling!

1727
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:14,130
不好啦
Oh, no!

1728
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:16,670
-油门踩到底  卡文迪许  -冲啊
- Foot to the floor, Cavendish! - Here we go!

1729
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:33,240
开始行动
Here we go.

1730
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:09,700
来吧  亚当  大口喝下吧
Come along now, Adam, handsomely does it

1731
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:11,750
病情在反复
Oh, the worm fights back,

1732
02:09:12,170 --> 02:09:15,460
黎明前总是最黑暗的
it is always darkest before the dawn.

1733
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:16,510
尤因先生
Mr. Ewing?

1734
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:21,030
尤因先生正在治疗的关键时候
Mr. Ewing is at a critical juncture of his treatment.

1735
02:09:21,030 --> 02:09:24,180
是死是活  就看接下来几小时了
The next few hours will determine if he lives or die.

1736
02:09:24,570 --> 02:09:25,780
那我留在这里
Then I stay here.

1737
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:27,700
别  别  你不能留下
No, no, no you can't.

1738
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:30,340
我必须留下  尤因先生救过我
I must. Mr. Ewing save my life.

1739
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:32,160
我理应这么做
It my duty.

1740
02:09:35,070 --> 02:09:37,620
你给我听好  你这大马猴
Listen to me, you ignorant ape,

1741
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:39,840
尤因先生不用你陪着
Mr. Ewing doesn't want you around him,

1742
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:42,030
说不准就是你传染给他的
you probably infected him to begin with.

1743
02:09:42,030 --> 02:09:45,950
他求我说"让那肮脏的黑鬼离我远点"
He begged me, and I quote: "Keep that dirty nigger away from me!"

1744
02:09:46,090 --> 02:09:48,890
请你尊重他的意愿
So please kindly respect his wishes!

1745
02:10:20,620 --> 02:10:22,200
-他去哪儿了  -我不知道
- Where'd he go? - I don't know.

1746
02:10:26,930 --> 02:10:28,000
妈的
Shit!

1747
02:10:46,110 --> 02:10:49,020
-为自由干杯  -敬自由
- To freedom. - To freedom.

1748
02:11:12,530 --> 02:11:19,270
你们全要吃不了兜着走
You are going to be sorry in ways you cannot even imagine.

1749
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:01,190
乔
Joe!

1750
02:12:08,070 --> 02:12:10,080
-这里没有非法移民  -你瞧
- No immigrants here, no immigrants here. - Look,

1751
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:12,610
我不是个警察  我们需要你的帮助
I'm not an inspector. We need your help...

1752
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:16,070
我听不懂你说什么
I don't understand.

1753
02:12:16,070 --> 02:12:17,920
我们不想把警察扯进来
We don't want the police to get involved,

1754
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:19,650
有个人想杀我们
but there is a man trying to kill me

1755
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:21,960
我们真的需要你的帮助
and we really need your help.

1756
02:12:27,630 --> 02:12:31,570
这里没有苏格兰爷们儿了吗
Are there no true Scotsmen in the house?

1757
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:37,010
这些英格兰杂种
Those there English gerants

1758
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:40,940
要侵犯我神圣的人权
are trampling all over my God-given rights!

1759
02:12:42,490 --> 02:12:44,960
这些人归我管
These people are mine.

1760
02:12:49,110 --> 02:12:54,010
他们残忍虐待我和我的朋友
They've used me an' my pals most direly,

1761
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:58,800
现在我们需要帮助
and we're in need of a wee bit of assistance!

1762
02:12:59,100 --> 02:13:00,200
好的  伙计
All right, pal.

1763
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,600
我们不会让你失望的
We'll not gonna let ya down.

1764
02:13:04,610 --> 02:13:06,940
你给我小心点  你这个草包
Now you just look here, you grebo

1765
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:09,650
苏格兰蠢货给我滚远些
you can go shag your bloody sporran...

1766
02:13:44,360 --> 02:13:46,900
刚进来的两个人往哪边跑了
OK, two people came in here. Which way did they go?

1767
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:52,540
往哪边跑了
Which way did they go?!

1768
02:13:55,120 --> 02:13:56,050
闭嘴
Shut up!

1769
02:13:57,210 --> 02:13:58,940
闭上你的鸟嘴
Shut the fuck up!

1770
02:14:04,030 --> 02:14:05,850
偷渡的蠢货
Stupid fucking wetback.

1771
02:14:10,290 --> 02:14:12,110
那是什么呀  尤因
What? What's that, Ewing?

1772
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:17,390
你含糊不清的我可不明白呀
How shall I comprehend when you drool and dribble so?

1773
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:19,750
让我猜猜  你好像在说
Oh, let me hazard a guess, something in the key of

1774
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:22,910
"噢  亨利  你怎么能如此对我"
"Oh Henry, how could you do this to me?

1775
02:14:23,140 --> 02:14:26,720
"我们可是朋友啊"  不好意思  你错了
"I thought we were friends?" Oh, unfortunately, you're wrong.

1776
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:31,260
错的和霍洛以及你的蠢岳父一样
Wrong like Horrox and your silly father-in-law.

1777
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:33,310
在这个世界上
There is only one rule

1778
02:14:33,310 --> 02:14:36,840
约束着芸芸众生的
that binds all people, one governing principle

1779
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:40,070
从来就只有这么一条规矩
that defines every relationship on God's green earth.

1780
02:14:40,290 --> 02:14:45,100
弱肉强食
"The Weak are Meat and the Strong Do Eat."

1781
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:20,090
走那条路
That way.

1782
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:28,890
我告诉过胡克不能信你  乔
I told Hooks you couldn't be trusted, Joe.

1783
02:15:28,890 --> 02:15:31,030
下一个就是你死  你这狗崽子
You'll be next, you son of a bitch.

1784
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:33,260
出来混  是要还的
Part of the business.

1785
02:15:34,210 --> 02:15:36,350
安心下黄泉吧
Enjoy your retirement.

1786
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:45,720
那狗  是我的  宝贝
Amaba... A este... perro!

1787
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:51,950
还有  别他妈叫我偷渡的
And don't call me a fucking wetback.

1788
02:15:56,690 --> 02:15:58,660
你要问我为什么
"Why?" You ask.

1789
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:03,200
很简单  因为我想要你箱子里的金子
It's absurdly simple, there is gold in your trunk, I want it.

1790
02:16:04,210 --> 02:16:05,950
就为这我得宰了你
so I've killed you for it.

1791
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,580
放开尤因先生  不然我会杀了你
Get away from Mr. Ewing or I kill you!

1792
02:16:21,810 --> 02:16:23,810
尤因先生  尤因先生
Mr. Ewing, Mr. Ewing!

1793
02:16:24,110 --> 02:16:27,200
得让你吐出...  振作点  尤因先生
Got to flush you with the... Com'on, Mr. Ewing.

1794
02:17:28,030 --> 02:17:29,140
什么声音
What was that?

1795
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:31,520
科纳的战吼
Kona war cry.

1796
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:33,460
扎克里
Zachry!

1797
02:17:39,060 --> 02:17:40,980
不  星美  不要
Oh no no, Sonmi, no.

1798
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:42,490
扎克里
Zachry!

1799
02:17:49,700 --> 02:17:52,680
这就是将军想让我看的吗
This is what the general wanted me to see?

1800
02:18:03,730 --> 02:18:08,080
终章的灵感像潮水般涌来  我废寝忘食
The end rushes towards me. Unable to eat or sleep.

1801
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:13,000
像尤因一样  这些尘世琐事只是桎梏
Like Ewing, the mortal coil has become a noose.

1802
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:18,940
而无益于音乐
but rather become music.

1803
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:32,180
她们以为会去往极乐神殿
They believe they're going to Exultation.

1804
02:18:32,590 --> 02:18:35,410
但其实不是  对吧
But they are not, are they?

1805
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:51,370
欢迎你  阿凯丝
Welcome, Alcelsium.

1806
02:18:52,620 --> 02:18:53,870
请坐
Take a seat.

1807
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:59,870
放松点
Just relax.

1808
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:03,380
我们要取下项圈
This is to remove your collar.

1809
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:25,600
敌人熟睡勿割喉
"Enemy's sleepin', don't slit that throat"

1810
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:12,260
基因工业需要
The genomics industry demands

1811
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:15,420
大量的生物材料来制造培育容器
a huge quantity of biomatter for wombtanks.

1812
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:19,000
更重要的是喂养劳动力
but more importantly, to sustain their engineered labor force.

1813
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:23,300
回收的人造人是廉价的蛋白质来源
Recycled fabricants are a cheap source of protein.

1814
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:26,050
这就是汤食
Soap.

1815
02:22:28,830 --> 02:22:31,890
我们吃的是同胞
They feed us to ourselves.

1816
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:44,420
那艘船
That ship...

1817
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:50,070
必须被摧毁
The ship must be destroyed.

1818
02:22:52,390 --> 02:22:53,390
没错
Yes.

1819
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:57,870
培育人造人的系统必须关闭
The systems that built them must be turned down.

1820
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:00,590
没错
Yes.

1821
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:05,930
不管生于子宫还是容器
No matter if you are born in a tank or a womb,

1822
02:23:05,930 --> 02:23:08,390
我们一样是纯种人
we are all pureblood.

1823
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:11,680
没错
Yes.

1824
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:19,460
我们必须战斗  甚至不惜牺牲
We must all fight... and if necessary, die

1825
02:23:20,370 --> 02:23:24,100
来告知世人真相
to teach people the truth.

1826
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:35,260
我们一直期待这一天
This is what we have been waiting for.

1827
02:23:42,270 --> 02:23:43,270
完成了
It's done.

1828
02:23:55,760 --> 02:24:00,170
天那  过来  凯金
Oh, oh. Here, Catkin. Oh.

1829
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:02,280
我的凯金
Oh, oh. Catkin.

1830
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:08,810
然后你被送往反抗联盟的卫星站
You were then taken to a Union control satellite link.

1831
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:12,180
我把我的启示
I broadcast my revelation to

1832
02:25:12,180 --> 02:25:15,960
传达给十二个联邦以及四个外星殖民地
the twelve States and four Off-World colonies.

1833
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:21,120
18分钟后  执法者展开攻击
18 minutes later, the Enforcers attacked.

1834
02:25:22,850 --> 02:25:25,760
存在即是被感知
To be is to be perceived.

1835
02:25:26,130 --> 02:25:28,360
而要了解自我
And so to know thyself is

1836
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:31,830
也只能通过他人之眼
only possible through the eyes of the other.

1837
02:25:34,510 --> 02:25:36,850
生命不朽的真谛
The nature of our immortal lives

1838
02:25:36,860 --> 02:25:41,100
在于我们言与行的影响
is in the consequences of our words and deeds,

1839
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:46,340
将会源源不断  永世长存
that go on apportioning themselves throughout all time.

1840
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:30,800
躲起来  躲好
Hide. Hide!

1841
02:26:51,050 --> 02:26:52,150
扎克里
Zachary!

1842
02:26:57,740 --> 02:27:00,960
你杀了酋长  现在你就是刀下鱼肉
From good chief, now you're meat.

1843
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:06,380
-凯金  -扎克叔叔
- Catkin - Uncle Zach.

1844
02:28:13,530 --> 02:28:14,920
感谢星美保佑
Thanks, Sonmi.

1845
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:17,620
不  谢谢你才对
No, thank you.

1846
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:30,530
来吧  尤因先生  再喝一口
Com'on, Mr. Ewing. One more.

1847
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:35,440
盐会清洗你的肠胃
Salt clean out your stomach.

1848
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,930
起作用了  尤因先生  加油
It goes. Com'on Mr. Ewing, com'on!

1849
02:28:46,770 --> 02:28:50,520
看看我们在哪儿  尤因先生
See where we are, Mr. Ewing?

1850
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:54,090
这是家
Home.

1851
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:02,660
梅根  思科史密斯
Megan Sixsmith?

1852
02:29:13,510 --> 02:29:14,720
让他们付出代价
Make them pay.

1853
02:29:19,540 --> 02:29:20,930
你就看我的吧
You can count on it.

1854
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:31,850
谢谢你
Thank you.

1855
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:37,920
我的叔叔是个科学家
My uncle was a scientist,

1856
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:41,860
但是  他坚信爱情的存在
but... he believed that love was real.

1857
02:29:43,220 --> 02:29:47,170
那是一种  自然现象
A kind of... natural phenomenon.

1858
02:29:49,610 --> 02:29:53,940
他相信爱情能经受死亡的考验
He believed that love could outlive death.

1859
02:29:58,010 --> 02:29:58,880
我如痴如醉地完成了它
Finished it in a frenzy

1860
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:01,690
这把我勾回到我们在剑桥的最后一夜
that reminded me of our last night in Cambridge.

1861
02:30:03,290 --> 02:30:07,200
欣赏最后一次看日出  享受最后一根烟
Watched my final sunrise, enjoyed the last cigarette.

1862
02:30:08,070 --> 02:30:10,560
我以为那是最完美的景象
Didn't think the view could be anymore perfect,

1863
02:30:10,630 --> 02:30:12,860
直到我看到你那顶破呢帽
until I saw that beat-up trilby.

1864
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:18,730
老实说  思科史密斯  虽然你戴着很滑稽
Honestly, Sixsmith. As ridiculous as that thing makes you look,

1865
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:21,610
我却觉得那是世间最美的风景
I don't believe I've ever seen anything more beautiful.

1866
02:30:28,770 --> 02:30:30,880
我斗胆一直看着你
Watched you for as long as I dared.

1867
02:30:33,450 --> 02:30:37,570
我觉得是上天安排  让我先看到你
I don't believe it was a fluke... that I saw you first.

1868
02:30:41,060 --> 02:30:42,730
-好的  -谢谢
- Okay. - Thank you.

1869
02:30:47,850 --> 02:30:50,020
船长同意让你随行
Captain say-so take ya with us.

1870
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:53,450
-我想和梅洛内一起走  -走  去哪
- I wanna go with Meronym. - Go... Go where?

1871
02:30:54,710 --> 02:30:59,070
先知们和我们遭遇一样  家园不复存在了
Prescients in the same boat as us. Got no home neitherwise.

1872
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,910
不  还不一定
Nay, not yet.

1873
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:08,870
你觉得会有人听到你的祷告
You think someone gonna hear your prayer,

1874
02:31:08,870 --> 02:31:10,580
然后从天而降吗
come down from the sky?

1875
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:12,760
也许吧
Perhaps...

1876
02:31:13,470 --> 02:31:14,670
也许有那么一天
Perhaps one day.

1877
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:17,500
这希望跟跳蚤一样大
One day ain't but a flea o' hope.

1878
02:31:18,510 --> 02:31:20,890
对  但跳蚤可是很顽强
Yay, and fleas ain't so easy to rid.

1879
02:31:34,990 --> 02:31:38,150
我相信有另一个世界在等着我们  思科史密斯
I believe there is another world waiting for us, Sixsmith.

1880
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:39,690
一个更好的世界
A better world.

1881
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:42,640
我会在那里等你
And I'll be waiting for you there.

1882
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:46,910
有什么能帮你吗  先生
May I help you, sir?

1883
02:31:47,050 --> 02:31:48,030
是的  谢谢
Yes, thank you.

1884
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:50,670
我在找我朋友  他来了爱丁...
I'm, I'mlooking for a friend who came to Edin...

1885
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,360
我认为死亡并不会持久
I believe we do not stay dead long.

1886
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:04,900
来科西嘉星空下我们的初吻地找我吧
Find me beneath the Corsican stars where we first kissed.

1887
02:32:06,690 --> 02:32:10,240
你永远的  R.F
Yours eternally. R.F.

1888
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:22,760
报告说张少校在突袭中身亡了
The report said commander Zheng was killed in the assault.

1889
02:33:24,370 --> 02:33:25,910
没错
That is correct.

1890
02:33:27,740 --> 02:33:29,630
但你说你爱过他吗
But you say that you loved him?

1891
02:33:31,390 --> 02:33:32,720
我爱他
Yes I do.

1892
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:37,010
你是说你依然爱着他吗
Do you mean you are still in love with him?

1893
02:33:38,140 --> 02:33:40,830
我是说我将永远爱他
I mean that I will always be.

1894
02:33:44,020 --> 02:33:47,220
我们的生命不仅仅属于自己
Our lives are not our own.

1895
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:53,630
从生到死  我们与他人息息相关
From womb to tomb, we're bound to others.

1896
02:33:56,170 --> 02:33:58,140
过去和现在
Past and present.

1897
02:34:06,730 --> 02:34:10,900
每一次罪孽以及每一次善行
And by each crime and every kindness,

1898
02:34:12,140 --> 02:34:15,160
来世终将有报
we birth our future.

1899
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:39,890
在你的启示里
In your revelation,

1900
02:34:39,890 --> 02:34:42,810
你谈到了生命在永恒中轮回
you spoke of the consequences of an individual's life

1901
02:34:42,810 --> 02:34:45,370
所造成的影响
rippling throughout eternity.

1902
02:34:49,130 --> 02:34:51,820
那是否表示你相信有来世
Does this mean that you believe in an afterlife?

1903
02:34:53,240 --> 02:34:55,200
在天堂或者地狱
In a heaven or hell?

1904
02:34:58,300 --> 02:35:02,200
我相信死亡只是一扇门
I believe death is only a door.

1905
02:35:04,190 --> 02:35:07,890
当一扇门关闭  另一扇会开启
When its closes, another opens.

1906
02:35:09,790 --> 02:35:12,090
若要我想象天堂
If I care to imagine heaven,

1907
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:15,210
我觉得那就像一扇新开启的门
I would imagine a door opening.

1908
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:18,880
在门后
And behind it,

1909
02:35:20,670 --> 02:35:24,470
我会找到  等我的他
I will find him there, waiting for me.

1910
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:36,580
我的爱人
My love.

1911
02:35:41,540 --> 02:35:43,940
上帝啊  我太想你了
Oh God, I missed you so much.

1912
02:35:51,020 --> 02:35:52,040
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

1913
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:56,710
请允许我问最后一个问题
If I may ask one last question...

1914
02:35:57,940 --> 02:36:00,930
你当时肯定知道反抗联盟的计划必败
You had to know this Union scheme was doomed to fail.

1915
02:36:01,350 --> 02:36:02,320
是的
Yes.

1916
02:36:02,670 --> 02:36:04,410
那你为什么还答应要做
And why did you agree to it?

1917
02:36:05,420 --> 02:36:08,810
这正是阿皮斯将军要求我去做的
This is what general Apis asked of me.

1918
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:11,120
做什么  被处决吗
What, to be executed?

1919
02:36:11,950 --> 02:36:16,700
如果没人知道我  真相也无法大白天下
If I had remained invisible, the truth would stay hidden.

1920
02:36:16,990 --> 02:36:18,640
我无法接受
I couldn't allow that.

1921
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:24,790
倘若没人相信你说的事实呢
And what if no one believes this truth?

1922
02:36:27,590 --> 02:36:29,560
有人已经相信了
Someone already does.

1923
02:36:49,370 --> 02:36:50,810
亚当  老天啊
Adam, good God...

1924
02:36:51,150 --> 02:36:54,850
我正在讲述你的惊人旅程呢
I have just been recounting your astonishing adventure.

1925
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:57,240
请一起来吧  拿一把椅子来
Please, join us. Give him a chair.

1926
02:36:57,240 --> 02:36:58,660
不了  谢谢你
No no, thank you.

1927
02:36:59,230 --> 02:37:00,430
我不能久留
I cannot stay.

1928
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:01,970
你怎么来这里了
What are you doing here?

1929
02:37:01,970 --> 02:37:05,030
医生不是说至少卧床三周吗
I thought the doctor said at least three weeks in bed?

1930
02:37:05,030 --> 02:37:07,480
没错  但是事不宜迟
He did, but this couldn't wait.

1931
02:37:08,970 --> 02:37:11,600
我得私下里和你谈谈  先生
I need to speak with you, sir. Privately.

1932
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:12,640
没问题
Of course.

1933
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:24,190
这是霍洛教士拿来的合同吗
Is that the contract from Reverend Horrox?

1934
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:29,070
-正是  -我可以派个人去取的
- It is indeed. - Well, you know I could have sent a boy.

1935
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:36,500
你疯了吗
Are you insane?!

1936
02:37:37,390 --> 02:37:40,820
我的命是一个解放了自己的奴隶救的
I owe my life to a self-freed slave.

1937
02:37:42,340 --> 02:37:43,980
这种肮脏的交易
And I cannot, in good conscience

1938
02:37:43,990 --> 02:37:46,810
我再也不能昧着良心做下去了
participate in this kind of business any longer.

1939
02:37:47,330 --> 02:37:49,620
石油说客因天鹅颈岛丑闻被捕

1940
02:37:49,460 --> 02:37:51,210
把这写成书肯定会大卖
This would make such a good book.

1941
02:37:51,980 --> 02:37:53,310
来干一杯
I'll drink to that.

1942
02:38:03,250 --> 02:38:05,770
窗外  硕大的雪花
Outside, fat snow flakes

1943
02:38:05,770 --> 02:38:09,570
一片片落在屋顶上
are falling on slate roofs and granite walls.

1944
02:38:09,910 --> 02:38:12,880
就像索尔仁尼琴在付蒙特劳动
Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont,

1945
02:38:12,880 --> 02:38:15,430
在流放中我该努力工作
I shall beaver away in exile.

1946
02:38:15,730 --> 02:38:19,690
和索尔仁尼琴不同的是  我并不孤单
Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.

1947
02:38:31,830 --> 02:38:37,000
你这该死的  你要不是我的女婿
Goddamn you, sir, if you were not my daughter's husband...

1948
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:38,310
你好  父亲
Hello, father.

1949
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:40,140
蒂尔达
Tilda?

1950
02:38:43,320 --> 02:38:44,450
发生什么事了
What's going on?

1951
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:47,070
我是来道别的
I've come to say goodbye.

1952
02:38:47,140 --> 02:38:49,580
道什么别  你要去哪儿
Goodbye? Where are you going?

1953
02:38:49,880 --> 02:38:53,590
我们要回东部  和废奴主义者一起奋斗
We're moving back East, to work with the abolitionists.

1954
02:38:53,890 --> 02:38:54,840
你说什么
What?

1955
02:38:56,280 --> 02:39:00,290
你的脑子被毒药腐蚀了吧
That poison has rotted your brain.

1956
02:39:00,380 --> 02:39:02,810
如果真是  那我建议你也来点毒药
Well, if it has, I highly recommend it.

1957
02:39:03,300 --> 02:39:05,040
我好久没感觉这么棒了
I've not felt this good in years.

1958
02:39:05,550 --> 02:39:09,370
蒂尔达  我禁止你和这疯子去任何地方
Tilda, I forbid you from going anywhere with this mad man.

1959
02:39:10,030 --> 02:39:13,040
我一生都在畏惧你  父亲
I've been afraid of you my whole life, father.

1960
02:39:15,820 --> 02:39:18,240
这次我要和我丈夫一起走
I'm going with my husband.

1961
02:39:23,230 --> 02:39:24,170
亚当
Adam.

1962
02:39:28,330 --> 02:39:29,360
听我说
Listen to me...

1963
02:39:30,490 --> 02:39:33,640
就算不是为了你  也想想我的外孙
For the sake of my grandson, if not your own...

1964
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:37,080
这个世界是有秩序的
there is a natural order to this world,

1965
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:41,170
那些企图颠覆秩序的人不会善终
And those who try to upend it do not fare well.

1966
02:39:42,740 --> 02:39:45,450
这条路行不通的
This movement will never survive.

1967
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:50,690
如果你加入他们  你们全家都会被放逐
If you join them, you and your entire family will be shunned.

1968
02:39:50,850 --> 02:39:54,680
好点的话  作为贱民被唾弃和鞭笞
At best, you'll exist as pariah, to be spat on and beaten.

1969
02:39:56,130 --> 02:39:59,130
运气坏点  被折磨  私刑处死
At worst, lynched or crucified.

1970
02:40:17,310 --> 02:40:18,780
为了什么
And for what?

1971
02:40:20,780 --> 02:40:21,910
为了什么啊
For what?

1972
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:25,320
不管做什么  你的努力
No matter what you do, it will never amount to anything more

1973
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:28,720
都只不过像是无垠大海里的一滴水
than a single drop in a limitless ocean.

1974
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:34,210
没有水滴  又哪儿来的大海
What is an ocean... but a multitude of drops?

1975
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:48,870
火要熄灭了
Fire is dyin'.

1976
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:53,520
正好我的故事也讲完了
Just as well, my yarning is done.

1977
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:57,690
别呀  求你啦  爷爷  再讲个故事吧
No, Gran'Pi please! Tell us another story. C'mon, please!

1978
02:40:57,690 --> 02:40:59,910
过来这里  你们这些小捣蛋
Come on, come here, you little buggars!

1979
02:40:59,910 --> 02:41:01,200
赶紧的  天凉了
Com'on, it's getting cold!

1980
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:04,040
没法子  听奶奶的吧  赶紧回去
Hup n'pe, you heard your Gran'mi, com'on, get on with you.

1981
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:18,770
你喜欢呆外面  是吧爷爷
You like it out here, don't you Gran'pi?

1982
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:23,380
我想是吧  让我回忆起我的山谷
Supposin'... Mind'es me of my Valley.

1983
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:25,280
哪一颗是地球
Which is Earth?

1984
02:41:28,980 --> 02:41:31,770
那一颗  闪着蓝光的就是
That'un there, that blue shimmerer.

1985
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:39,160
扶爷爷站起来吧
Now, help ya Gran'pi up.

1986
02:41:43,750 --> 02:41:44,440
你会给我们讲
Are you gonna tell us

1987
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:47,330
那艘大飞船和长长的休眠
about the whoahsome ship, and the Big Sleep,

1988
02:41:47,330 --> 02:41:48,350
还有好多后来的故事吗
and all the next-next?

1989
02:41:48,350 --> 02:41:52,000
你奶奶讲那些讲得比我好多啦
Oh, your Gran'mi tells the next-next way better than me.

1990
02:41:54,140 --> 02:41:55,910
你还爱奶奶吗
D'ya still love Gran'mi?

1991
02:41:58,830 --> 02:42:03,410
你奶奶是我生命里最美好的意外
Your Gran'mi... is the best thin' that ever happened to me.

1992
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:11,310
来吧  老头子
Come o'er here, Gran'pi.

1993
02:42:11,970 --> 02:42:14,390
让我暖暖你那把老骨头
Let me warm them ol' bone.
