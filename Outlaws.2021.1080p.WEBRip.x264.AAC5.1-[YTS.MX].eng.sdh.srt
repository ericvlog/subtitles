This is what you do after you score big.

-Hello, handsome. What's your name?
-Nacho.

691
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:57,201
I'm Francesca.

693
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:01,816
This is the young man
I was telling you about.

694
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:04,025
You're very handsome, you know.

695
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,150
Tell her something nice.
See how hot she is?

696

-You touch it, you pay for it.
-This is the good thing about this place.

698
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,743
Things are clear. See?

699
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,083
I give this lady 5,000 pesetas,

700
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:21,811
and then you go with her
and have the time of your life.

701
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,333
Who? Me?

702
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,410
-Yes, you.
-No, no, no, no.

703
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,326
-Yes, yes. Come on, man. Go.
-No.

704
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:29,776
You've earned it.

705
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:33,985
[CHINO] Oh, shit.

706
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:35,416
Hey, Zarco.

707
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,216
Give me some. Come on, man.

708
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,410
Buy me a whore, Zarco.

709
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,180

Do you want me to wash your dick?

712
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:23,208
Uh, no. I'm... I'm good, thanks.

713
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:28,441
Don't worry. We have plenty of time.

714

-It's just that I...
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

715
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,451
What do you know?

716
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:37,613
Well, I know that, uh...
Just what Zarco told me.

717
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,701
That you're still a little shy, maybe.

718
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:43,591
But it's okay, you know. Just come closer.

719
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,660
Is something wrong?

720
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,410
-I don't know.
-What's wrong? You don't like me?

721
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,326
-No, no, no.
-You don't like my tits?

722

No, no. Yes.

723
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,493
Did you know in the US,

724
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,743
they put stuff in them
to make them bigger?

725
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,660
-Really?
-Yes.

726
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,910
I've always wanted to have massive tits,

727
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,035
but people tell me they find them nice.

728
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,541
Yes. Yes.

Is that better?

733
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
You can lick them if you want.

734

-Yes.
-No, wait, I understand.

It's scary at the beginning.

-Guy just got here.
-It's his first assignment,

759

so he can lose his virginity."

Hmm. My lady-boss,
