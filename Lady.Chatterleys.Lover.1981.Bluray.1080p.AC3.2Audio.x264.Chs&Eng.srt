12
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,590

The honour of having the first dance with the new Lady Chatterley.

14
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,940
这位夫人很漂亮
This one's pretty enough...

15
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,520
可我听说她是艺术家的女儿
...but I understand she's the daughter of an artist.

16
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,300
她正是克利福德和这所老宅子所需要的
She's just what Clifford and this old house needs.

17
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,300
她有着别人永远无法拥有的活力
She's alive in the way the others never could be.

18
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,780
- 需求面前无法律，我的朋友  - 政治，都是政治
- Necessity knows no law, my friends.  - Politics, politics.

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:24,620
- 要想毁掉聚会，就请德国人来  - 安东，咱们现在还不是敌人呢

20
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,080

- But the situation is serious.  - Please, not this evening.

21
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:35,290

- Why don't you dance with my wife?  - With pleasure. Excuse me.

22
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,720
女士们，先生们，请大家注意啦
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?

23
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,810
非常抱歉打断大家跳舞，但我保证你们很愿意听到这个消息
I'm sorry to interrupt the dance, but I'm sure you'll want to hear the news.

24
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,730
在刚才的二十四分钟里，英国和德国已经处于交战状态
For the last 24 minutes, England has been at war with Germany.

25
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,490
让我们国干杯
Let us drink to England.

26
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,120
英国
England.

27
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,330
- 英国  - 英国
- England.  - England.

28
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,330
- 当然也为德国  - 为德国
- And to Germany, of course.  - To Germany.

29
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,840
- 也为英国  - 为德国
- And to England.  - Germany.

30
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,050
再见，姨妈，请照顾好康妮
Goodbye, Auntie. Look after Connie.

31
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,930
- 我很快就会回来  - 再见，希尔达
- I can't be long.  - Goodbye, Hilda.

32
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,680
再见，再见啦
Goodbye. Goodbye.

33
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,560
- 亲爱的，我不希望你去送我  - 真的吗？
- Darling, I'd rather you didn't come.  - Are you sure?

34
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,200
- 克里夫，多多保重  - 罗伯兹
- Cliff, take care of yourself.  - Roberts.

35
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,670
我应该能回来赶上猎野鸡的季节
Should be back just in time for the pheasant season.

36
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,510
冲啊，弟兄们！
Come on, Iads!

37
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,100
冲啊！向前冲！
Go on! Forwards!

38
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,820
快点！冲啊，快！
Faster! Go on, faster!

39
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,900
保持队形！保持队形！
Keep the line! Keep the line!

40
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,240
冲啊！向前冲！冲啊！
Forwards! Forwards, forwards!

41
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,120
上，弟兄们！
Go on, Iads!

42
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,660
冲啊！
Forwards!

43
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,890
哥们，这人还有口气
This one's still breathing, Paddy.

44
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,410
“你可以坐下，沃辛先生” 她在口袋里找着铅笔
"you can take a seat, Mr. Worthing." She looks in her pocket for a pencil.

45
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,960
“谢谢，布莱克奈夫人，我喜欢站着”
"Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing."

46
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,670
布菜克奈夫人手里拿着笔记本说
Lady Bracknell, notebook in hand:

47
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,840
“我这份合格者名单上没有你
"you are not down on my list of eligible young men...

48
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:37,510
这和波尔顿女公爵的名单是一样的，我们一起做的
...but it's the same list the Duchess of Bolton has. We work together.

49
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,560
不过，如果你能回答一位慈爱母亲的问题
However, I will enter your name should your answers be...

50
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,600
我就可以把你的名字加上”
...what an affectionate mother requires.

51
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,610
“你抽烟吗？”“抽，必须承认，我抽烟”
Do you smoke?" "yes, I must admit, I smoke."

52
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,320
“很高兴听你这样说”
"I am glad to hear it."

53
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,860
十点半了，该睡觉了，亲爱的
10:30. It's time to go to bed, darling.

54
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,330
又是一天过去了
Dear, dear, another day gone.

55
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,690
谢谢，亲爱的，我自己来
Thank you, darling, I can manage.

56
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,520
晚安，康妮
Good night, Connie.

57
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,340
早上好
Good morning.

58
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,060
斯图尔特勋爵夫妇那美丽的家，弗里奇利大厦公开出售了
Fritchley Hall, the home of Lord and Lady Stewart is offered for sale.

59
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:54,690
有传言说，马特洛克附近的西普利家可能会遭到同样命运
It's rumoured that Shipley, near Matlock, may suffer the same fate.

60
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,440
好像整个世界都在我们周围崩溃
It's as if the whole world is collapsing around us.

61
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,150
怎么回事，亲爱的？
What's that, darling?

62
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,950
他们要卖掉弗里奇利大厦和西普利家的房子
They want to sell Fritchley Hall and Shipley.

63
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,500
我看这样的事会一件接一件发生
I suppose the one thing pushes out the other.

64
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,460
咱们怎么样？咱们这房子呢？
But what about us? Here? This house?

65
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,250
除了变化本身，什么都在变
Everything changes except change itself.

66
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,010
我想我要抽根雪茄
I fancy a cigar is called for.

67
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,180
我自己来，谢谢你，菲尔德．
I can manage. Thank you, Field.

68
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,230
- 今天晚上就到这了  - 好的，先生
- That will be all for this evening.  - Very good, sir.

69
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,320
我觉得你很了不起，真的
I think you're wonderful, I do, really.

70
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,280
- 为什么？ - 你能这样陪着克利夫德
- Why?  - The way you are with Clifford.

71
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:27,120
我觉得这太了不起了，可怜的孩子…
I think it's wonderful, really. Poor boy...

72
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,450
伤残成这样了
...so crippled as he is.

73
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
最多只能算半个男人，可以这么说
Not more than half a man, you might say.

74
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,000
对我这样的女人来说没什么
It's the right half for a woman like me.

75
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,430
他说话妙语连珠，机智诙谐
He can be so witty and entertaining.

76
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,810
不过对一位年轻的妻子那就不好说了
But for a young wife, I'm not so sure at all.

77
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:56,900
- 要不要来一根？ - 谢谢，我自己有
- Care for one of mine?  - Thank you, I have one of my own.

78
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,820
我嫁给理查德时非常年轻
I was very young when I married Richard.

79
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,610
我们想搞改革、搞政治，诸如此类，什么都想
We wanted reform, politics, all that sort of thing.

80
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,450
我们也那样做了，可从他去世后，尽管有孩子们
And we got it. But ever since he died, despite the children...

81
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,250
我还是觉得活着毫无意义，这种感觉太可怕了
...I feel I've lived for nothing. It's a dreadful feeling.

82
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:20,040
知道自己来到世上要做的事，死的时候肯定完不成
To know you're bound to die without having the things you were born for.

83
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,510
死？谁要死？
Die? Who's going to die?

84
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,180
我死过又活了，所以我要说永生
I've been there and back. Immortality.

85
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,560
我们来到世上为了什么？我觉得人生在世好像有很多事
What are we born for? It seems to me that we are born for so many things.

86
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,480
又好像什么都没有
Or perhaps we're not born for anything at all.

87
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,900
这只是我们下决心的问题
It's just a matter of making up our minds.

88
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,950
- 为永生干杯  - 为永生
- Immortality.  - Immortality.

89
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,240
我觉得女人应该经历更多的事
I think women should experiment more.

90
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,330
得到你年轻时想要的一切
Get what you want in your youth.

91
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,080
如果一个女人随着年华逝去，觉得自己虚度了光阴
Nothing is so bad for a woman getting on in years...

92
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,460
还有什么比这更糟的
...than the thought that she's missed.

93
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,970
晚安，亲爱的
Good night, dear.

94
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,930
我明天一大早离开，所以见不到你了
I'm leaving early in the morning, so I can't see you again.

95
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,730
没有什么能比一个被徒劳无益的悔恨
There's nothing so sad or futile...

96
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,770
纠缠着的老妇人更悲哀更无助的了
...as an elderly woman possessed by vain regrets.

97
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,840
我要疯了
I am possessed.

98
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,560
康妮，我得跟你谈谈
Connie, I need to talk to you.

99
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,440
坐一会儿吧
Sit down a moment.

100
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,990
从某种意义上说，你是最悲惨的失败者
you know, you're the worst loser, in a sense.

101
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
- 亲爱的  - 我依赖你，靠你而活
- Darling.  - I depend on you, live on you.

102
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,250
而你放弃了生命中极为重要的部分
But you're denied a serious part of life.

103
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,670
你放弃的东西尝在你的潜意识中起作用，伤害你
The fact you are denied, it may work inside your subconscious, harming you.

104
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,720
可你知道我需要你就像你需要我一样
But you know I need you as much as you need me.

105
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,140
- 以前你很需要我，对吗？ - 当然了
- you did want me before, didn't you?  - Of course.

106
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,270
我知道，所以这才让人心酸
I know, and it's bitter.

107
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,690
我不想让你觉得你在为我牺牲
you see, I don't want you to feel you've brought me a sacrifice.

108
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,860
康妮，我必须跟你说，如果有个男人
Connie, I must tell you this. If ever there's a man...

109
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,530
你非常想让他和你做爱
...who you absolutely want to make love to you...

110
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:41,290
那就接受他吧，如果你想，就找个情人吧
...take him. Have a lover if you want to.

111
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,920
快看，老鹰
Look, a kestrel.

112
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,010
永远不要忘记，我爱你
Don't ever forget I love you.

113
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,720
- 嗨，过来  - 过来，宝贝
- Hey, come on here.  - Come here, girl.

114
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,060
过来，快过来
Come on up. Come on up.

115
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,940
- 对不起，这狗打扰你们了  - 别担心，它是个好狗
- I'm sorry about the dog, sir.  - Don't worry, she's a good girl.

116
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,320
你能不能把我推回房子？
Look, will you give me a push back to the house?

117
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,080
- 你好，夫人  - 你好
- Milady.  - Hello.

118
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,750
好了，拉吧
All right, pull.

119
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,610
谢谢，迈勒斯
Thank you, Mellors.

120
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,960
谢谢，菲尔德
Thank you, Field.

121
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,340
克利夫德？
Clifford?

122
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,880
要帮忙吗？
Do you need some help?

123
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,310
- 不用，马上就好了  - 咱们去年情况怎么样？
- No, nearly done now.  - How did we do last year?

124
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,770
还可以，连鸡都卖得不错
Not bad, considering. Even the pheasants sold quite well.

125
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,780
那煤矿呢？是不是应该重新开张？
What about the mine? Shouldn't you open it again?

126
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,900
- 我听说现在煤…  - 还不是时候
- I heard that coal...  - Not the right time.

127
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,990
现在时机不好
Not the right time at all.

128
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,960
康妮
Connie.

129
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,300
没事，亲爱的，别着急
It's all right, darling. Don't worry.

130
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,910
我烦透了这些唱片，亲爱的
I'm sick and tired of these records, darling.

131
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,500
- 能不能像往常那样为我弹点什么？ - 你想要我弹什么？
- Could you play me something?  - What would you like me to play?

132
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,300
喜欢什么弹什么，你知道有首曲子你弹得特别好
Whatever you like. you know the one. The one you play so well.

133
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,960
那好吧
All right, then.

134
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,290
克利夫德！
Clifford!

135
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,130
快去叫克里斯蒂医生
Call for Dr. Christie.

136
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,340
医生马上就来了
The doctor's on his way.

137
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,650
他们来了，夫人
They're here, milady.

138
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,980
不过不是医生，是护士
But it's not the doctor, it's a nurse.

139
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,910
我是伯尔顿太太，听到消息马上就赶了过来
I'm Mrs. Bolton. I came as quickly as I could.

140
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,250
- 你的气色也不好  - 不，我没事
- you look ill too.  - No, I'm fine.

141
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,960
一点都不好，我先给他看，然后再给你看
Far from fine. I'll take a look at him first, then I'll take a look at you.

142
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,800
没事，我没事
I'm fine. I'm fine.

143
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,550
下午好，克利夫德先生
Good afternoon, Sir Clifford.

144
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,100
伯尔顿太太，我什么事都没有
I'm perfectly all right.

145
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,890
如果不介意，让我看看再说吧，感觉怎么不好？
I'll decide, if you don't mind. What seems to be the trouble?

146
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,230
没什么新鲜的，还是老毛病
Nothing new, just the same old nonsense.

147
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,860
这回是肩膀，还是可恶的脊椎引起的
It's my shoulders this time, and what's left of my damned spine.

148
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,530
- 这天气真是拜上帝所赐  - 只要不发大水就好
- This weather is a godsend.  - Providing we don't get a flood.

149
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,450
不会的，不出这星期就会放晴
We won't. It'll clear up.

150
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,420
有什么我可以做的？
Isn't there anything I can do?

151
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,130
- 告诉我，如果再犯了我该怎么办？  - 好的
- Show me, in case it happens again.  - We'll see.

152
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,430
有你可做的事，去看看迈勒斯有没有让鸡孵蛋
you can do something. See if Mellors is setting eggs under the birds.

153
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,890
我们去年就孵了，希望今年做得更好
We did well last year. I want to do even better.

154
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,850
克利夫德，那事现在并不重要
Clifford, that's not important now.

155
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,230
新鲜空气和健康的运动
Fresh air and healthy activity...

156
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,560
是我给你开的药方，夫人
...that's my prescription for you, milady.

157
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,380
疼痛没什么可怕的
Pain is nothing to fear.

158
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,760
那是身体在告诉我们什么地方出了毛病
It's just the body's way of telling us that something's amiss.

159
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,140
好了，转过来吧
Right, on your back.

160
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,560
康妮，这么快就回来了？迈勒斯怎么说？
Connie, you're back early. What did Mellors say?

161
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,930
我没找到他
I couldn't find him.

162
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,980
康妮，这么简单的事都不能让你做
Connie, I can't ask you to do the simplest thing.

163
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,530
给你的，夫人
That's for you, milady.

164
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,900
- 这是什么？ - 奎宁和一些草药
- What is it?  - Just some quinine and herbs.

165
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,410
希望不是春药
Hope it's not a love potion.

166
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,410
伯尔顿太太要在这儿过夜，请把蓝色房间给她收拾一下
Mrs. Bolton is spending the night. Organise the blue room for her.

167
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,580
- 好的  - 喝了吧．
- Of course.  - Drink up.

168
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,380
你今天够累的，克利夫德先生，必须好好休息
you've had a tiring day, Sir Clifford. you must get some rest.

169
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,930
- 伯尔顿太太，我来照顾我丈夫吧  - 好的，夫人
- I'll look after my husband.  - Certainly, milady.

170
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,350
- 晚安，克利夫德先生，晚安，夫人  - 晚安，谢谢你
- Good night, Sir Clifford and milady.  - Good night, and thank you.

171
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,480
- 什么这么好笑？ - 《哈吉巴巴历险记》
- Now, what's so funny?  - The Adventures of Hajji Baba.

172
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,200
他厌恶不蒙面莎的英国女人
He's repelled by the naked faces of English women.

173
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,110
如果她们蒙上脸
If only they'd covered their faces...

174
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,830
那他身上将燃起怎样的激情
...what fire of passion would have run through him.

175
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,750
这太有趣了
That's amusing.

176
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,330
人们除了脸别的地方都看不见，也许是一种遗憾
It's a pity we never see anything of people but their face.

177
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:54,550
毕竟对于大多数人来说，脸是最难看的
After all, the worst part of most people is their face.

178
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,930
你是说我们应该蒙着脸光着身子外出？
you mean if we covered our faces and walked about naked?

179
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,890
像雷诺阿那样，可以呀
Like Renoir. Why not?

180
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:11,020
没有头的躯干部雕像往往非常漂亮
And a torso in sculpture is often so lovely without a head.

181
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,240
- 它有着自己的生命  - 也许吧
- It has a life of its own.  - Perhaps.

182
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,240
对不起，如果我今天下午让你扫兴
Sorry if I was unpleasant this afternoon.

183
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,120
早上好，夫人
Good morning, milady.

184
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,330
象应该这样走，对吧？
And the bishop moves this way, yes?

185
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,460
- 对，马应该…  - 斜两格前进一格
- That's right, and the knight moves...  - One ahead and two diagonally.

186
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,010
你真漂亮，今天想干什么？
you look beautiful. What are you gonna do today?

187
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,510
没什么特别的
Nothing in particular.

188
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,310
如果没什么更好的事，为什么不再去一趟？
If you've nothing better to do, why not try again?

189
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,770
- 千什么？ - 看看鸡孵蛋没有
- Try what?  - Find out about the pheasant's eggs.

190
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,190
- 你要我去，我就去吧  - 谢谢，亲爱的
- If you want me to.  - Thank you, darling.

191
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,480
走这儿
There.

192
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,910
- 你可真快  - 是的，先生
- you're very quick.  - That I am, sir.

193
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,690
对不起，夫人
Excuse me, ma'am.

194
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,120
别叫，嗨
Quiet. Hey.

195
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,210
趴下
Lie down.

196
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,430
- 你好  - 你好
- Hello.  - Hello.

197
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,640
- 有什么事吗？ - 先生想知道你什么时候让鸡孵蛋？
- What can I do for you?  - When will you set the eggs?

198
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:00,270
已经孵上了，都安排好了，告诉他，情况比去年好
Already started. It's under control. Be better than last year, tell him.

199
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,240
- 可以吗？ - 当然可以
- May I?  - If you'd like.

200
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,640
- 这里很让人感觉很愉快  - 是吗？
- It's very pleasant here.  - you think so?

201
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:43,480
是的，我会来看看那些鸡，看它们一天天长大
yes. I shall come here and see the birds, watch them grow.

202
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,940
是吗？
Will you, now?

203
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,110
那小屋有两把钥匙吧？
Are there two keys to the hut?

204
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,830
- 听见我说话了吗？ - 只有一把
- Do you hear me?  - There's only one key.

205
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,160
- 你能不能再配一把？ - 可以倒是可以
- Couldn't you have one made?  - Aye, we could.

206
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,590
为什么克利夫德先生不给你建个凉亭？
Only, why doesn't Sir Clifford build a little summerhouse for you?

207
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,340
不用，我就是想看鸡孵蛋
No, I want to watch the pheasants.

208
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,550
这里只能有我一个人，那些鸡在孵蛋呢
I have to be on me own, now that the birds are laying.

209
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,390
- 我不会打扰它们  - 鸡不喜欢周围有陌生人
- I can't interfere.  - Birds don't like strangers around.

210
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:25,150
- 我要一把钥匙，什么时候给我？ - 我到底要听几个人的？
- I want a key. When can I have it?  - How many bosses do I have, anyway?

211
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,610
那你就别配钥匙，再说了，我根本就不想再来这里
Don't make a key. On second thought, I don't ever want to be here again.

212
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,710
克利夫德？把你的话传达给迈勒斯了，这是什么？
Clifford? I gave Mellors your message. What's this?

213
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,290
我决定再磨炼一下自己的手，想起雷诺阿了
I've decided to try my hand again, thinking of Renoir.

214
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,260
- 真是个好主意  - 没错，我以前一直画得不太好
- What a good idea.  - Of course, I was never very good.

215
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,590
不知道会画成什么样，反正已经开始了
I wonder what I'll see now, after all that's happened.

216
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,760
- 给我画幅像吧  - 那你得排队等着
- Well, there's always me.  - you'll have to join the queue.

217
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,140
- 伯尔顿太太已经提出了要求  - 怎么可能？
- Mrs. B's already asked.  - How can she?

218
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,850
- 她要住上一段时间  - 没什么严重的事吧？
- She's gonna stay a while.  - Nothing serious, is it?

219
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,860
没有，她只是想让你更自由一些
No, she just thought it would free you more.

220
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,610
她要给我做康复，所以要住下
She'll give me my exercises. She may as well be here.

221
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,160
- 这样不是很好吗？ - 是很好
- It's marvellous, isn't it?  - Marvellous.

222
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,210
伯尔顿太太，你要和我们住上一阵，这太好了
you'll be staying with us a while. That's good.

223
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,750
我觉得这样最好，你今天找到迈勒斯先生了吗？
I think it's for the best. Did you find Mr. Mellors today?

224
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,170
找到了，他是我见过的最没礼貌的人
I did. He's the most insolent man I've ever talked to.

225
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:37,260
他从小就是个目中无人的小坏蛋
He was a defiant little demon, even when he was a lad.

226
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:43,180
- 你认识他？ - 大家都认识他，他就喜欢独来独往
- you know him, then?  - He prefers to keep his own company.

227
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:47,100
我觉得只要有人能接近他，他还是很有感情的
I thought he had a heart, if anybody could get there.

228
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,690
- 有感情？ - 他让许多女人觉得难以接近
- A heart.  - He just gets most women's backs up.

229
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,480
就像他对你那样
Like he has with you.

230
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,990
- 梅花  - 我出A
- Club.  - Ace.

231
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,160
你不能那样，你作弊，拿回去
you can't do that. you're cheating.

232
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,330
那是你的，该我了，我出J
That's you. My go. Jack.

233
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,170
- 换牌  - 我累了，我想上楼了
- Card change.  - I'm tired. I think I'll go up.

234
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,250
- 晚安，伯尔顿太太  - 晚安，去人
- Good night.  - Good night.

235
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,800
- 晚安，亲爱的  - 晚安
- Good night, darling.  - Good night.

236
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,260
- 我出十  - 十
- Ten.  - Ten.

237
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,270
- 八，换牌  - 换同花？
- Eight and change.  - Change of suit?

238
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,890
- 是的  - 要哪个花色？
- yes.  - To what?

239
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,850
- 梅花  - 给你梅花
- Clubs.  - Clubs.

240
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,700
克利夫德，我有个问题，你说了我应该找个情人
Clifford, I have a problem. you said I should take a lover.

241
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:46,290
- 想让我帮你挑吗？ - 不是，如果有了孩子怎么办？
- Want me to choose for you, do you?  - No, but what if I have a child?

242
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,290
如果我有孩子，你会介意吗？
Would you mind if I had a child?

243
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,750
- 有谁的孩子？ - 不知道，你会介意吗？
- If you had whose child?  - I don't know.

244
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,380
你能不能保证那是圣灵的雾
Couldn't you promise it'd be by the Holy Ghost?

245
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,340
- 你会介意吗？ - 谁的孩子？
- Would you mind?  - Whose child?

246
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,590
但是你会问？
But need you ask?

247
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,970
是不是别人会那样看，孩子是圣灵的？
Isn't it the Holy Ghost if one looks at it that way?

248
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,150
好吧，亲爱的，生育是自然法则
All right, my dear, breed. It's nature's law.

249
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,940
我相信我的儿子，他的父亲配得上准男爵
I trust my son and heir will have a father worthy of a baronet.

250
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,320
当然，我相信你的品味
But I trust your taste.

251
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:32,630
- 这对你们俩都是一种牺牲  - 为什么而牺牲？
- It is a sacrifice for both of you.  - A sacrifice to what?

252
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,130
上帝的意愿
To God's will.

253
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,460
你能不能脱开虔诚的外表
Can't you come out from under your pieties...

254
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,630
像男人对女人那样和我说话？
...and speak to me as a man to a woman?

255
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,010
- 想要我宽恕你做的什么事吗？ - 不是
- To condone something you have done?  - No.

256
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,810
如果你把事情看作是一段时间的尝试
Perhaps if you look upon things as a period of trial...

257
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,570
也许就能找到答案了
...in time, you will find your way.

258
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,900
- 再见，神父  - 再见
- Good afternoon, Father.  - Good afternoon.

259
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,170
一段时间的尝试
A period of trial.

260
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,430
别动，伯尔顿太太
Keep still, Mrs. B.

261
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,440
你坐了那么长时间都不烦，真是很难得
This is hard enough without you fidgeting all the time.

262
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,780
- 哦，是你呀  - 打得不错
- Oh, it's you.  - Not bad.

263
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,540
- 想认真打一盘吗？  - 如果你愿意当然可以，很可能你赢
- Want to play seriously?  - If you like. you'll probably win.

264
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,500
我对这种打法还没太掌握
I haven't got the hang of it this way.

265
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,210
我要是能赢，那就是风向变了
Well, it'll be a change for me to win.

266
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,340
听说你今天做了件和你性格不太相符的事
I hear you did something rather out of character today.

267
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,800
- 去教堂了，是吗？ - 是的
- Went to church, did you?  - yes.

268
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,100
为什么要去？
What on earth for?

269
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,650
我想去和圣灵预约一下
I thought I'd book an appointment with the Holy Ghost.

270
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,360
夫人
Milady.

271
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,950
坐一
Sit.

272
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,210
- 有事吗，迈勒斯？ - 你的钥匙配好了，夫人
- yes, Mellors?  - Got that key for you, milady.

273
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,630
- 很麻烦吗？ - 不，怎么会呢，不麻烦
- Was it a lot of trouble?  - No. How could it be?

274
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,760
- 那就谢谢你了  - 走吧
- Thank you, then.  - Come on.

275
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,770
- 早上好，亲爱的  - 早上好
- Good morning.  - Morning.

276
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,900
- 早上好  - 早上好，我来晚了吗？
- Morning.  - Morning. am I late?

277
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,190
- 没有，一点都不晚  - 睡得好吗，夫人？
- Not at all.  - Did you sleep well, milady?

278
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,360
谢谢，伯尔顿太太，我去吃早餐了
Thank you, Mrs. Bolton. Well, I'll have some breakfast.

279
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,410
好的，一会儿见
yes, see you later.

280
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,190
进去吧
Go in there.

281
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,490
来吧，小东西，过来吧
Come on, my little ones, come on.

282
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,620
过来吧，小家伙们，过来
Come on, my little ones, come on.

283
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,390
- 你好  - 你好
- Hello.  - Hello.

284
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,200
真为克利夫德先生感到惋惜
Shame about Sir Clifford, isn't it?

285
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,950
有年轻漂亮的妻子和这片土地，却没有孩子跑来跑去
Fair, young wife and this land and no children to pass it on to.

286
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,250
这说明你太不了解他了，克利夫德先生身体一直在不断好转
That shows how little you know. Sir Clifford's getting stronger.

287
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,510
谢谢，罗伯特，就停在这儿吧
Thank you, Robert. That will be all.

288
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,230
我开的药方好像起作用了
My prescription seems to have worked.

289
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,520
- 你为克利夫德做得很好  - 我是说新鲜空气和健康的运动
- you've done wonders for Clifford.  - I meant fresh air, healthy activity.

290
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,030
对女人来说，如果心死了，生命也就没多少意必了
It's not much of a life for a woman if her heart never works.

291
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,120
有很多人其实并没有心
There's many who have no real hearts.

292
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,790
如果有心的话，你就不会为了钱而活着
But if you've got a heart, you don't want to live for money.

293
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,790
你说得很对
I'm sure you're right.

294
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,750
如果一个人的话超过了她应该说的，那就是因为
If there's something to make one say more than one should, it's because...

295
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,130
你是个真正的女人，她的心在为你燃烧，而不是反对你
...you're a true woman and a body's heart burns for you, not against you.

296
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,550
我知道你不会做反对我的事
I know you wouldn't do anything against me.

297
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,680
任何人都不会反对，如果我能帮上忙的话
Neither shall anyone else if I can help it.

298
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,030
好孩子
Good girl.

299
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,120
- 你好  - 你好
- Hello.  - Hello.

300
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,830
你没生病呀
you weren't ill then.

301
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,370
护士走了，所以我要陪克利夫德先生
Nurse went away, so I stayed with Sir Clifford.

302
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,790
哦，这样啊
I see.

303
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,760
- 多么可爱，多么柔软啊  - 是啊，可爱的小东西
- What lovely, soft creatures.  - Aye, pretty young things.

304
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,470
- 给你  - 过来，宝贝
- There.  - Come, baby.

305
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,440
- 它们不喜欢我  - 那就找个喜欢的
- They don't like me.  - Then we'll find one that does.

306
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,480
来
Go on.

307
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,910
这不值得哭
It's not worth crying for.

308
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,890
好啦，好啦
There, there.

309
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,140
没事啦
It's all right.

310
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,470
你真漂亮
you're beautiful.

311
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,010
太美了
So beautiful.

312
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:15,790
对不起，来晚了，为什么今天不让我来做呢？你可以走了
I'm sorry I'm late. Why don't I do that today? you're excused.

313
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,710
- 很好，夫人  - 这主意好
- Very good, milady.  - What a nice idea.

314
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,090
想赛一盘吗？
Want a game in a minute?

315
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,050
我不想再赢你了
I don't want to beat you again.

316
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,640
今天你赢不了，我一直在练习
you won't today. I've been practising.

317
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:34,100
- 别走，伯尔顿太太  - 有事吗，夫人？
- Don't go, Mrs. Bolton.  - Excuse me, milady.

318
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,310
- 一起喝茶吧，你也是家里的一员  - 谢谢
- Join us, you're part of the family.  - Thank you.

319
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,400
- 你喜欢什么样的茶？ - 很浓，加好多糖
- How do you like your tea?  - Very strong, lots of sugar.

320
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,360
又浓又甜的茶
Strong, sweet tea.

321
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:48,070
我的口味是从我丈夫那儿来的
I got the taste from my husband.

322
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,950
- 他去世很多年了吗？ - 我当时二十四岁
- Is it many years since he died?  - I was 24.

323
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,500
- 太可怕了  - 是啊，和你守寡的年纪一样，康妮
- How awful.  - yes, same age you were widowed, Con.

324
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:01,210
我们正努力帮你站起来，不是吗？
Now, we're going to get you back on your feet, aren't we?

325
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,760
- 是的  - 不知道你是怎么熬过来的
- yes.  - I don't know how you lived through it.

326
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,550
我自己也没想到
I didn't think I could.

327
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,560
心起了很太作用，我怀念他，从来没有忘记他
The heart makes up for a lot. I miss him, but I'll never forget him.

328
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,060
他从来没有离开我，我也决不会离开他
He'd never have left me, and I'll never leave him.

329
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,020
这是给我们大家上的一课，康妮
A lesson to us all, Con.

330
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,740
我是说，这非常感人，伯尔顿太太
I mean, that's very touching, Mrs. B.

331
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,450
- 你永远不会离开我，对吧，康妮？ - 克利夫德
- you'll never leave me, will you?  - Clifford.

332
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,580
一旦你在心里认为自己是妻子，那就永远是妻子
Once a wife in your heart, always a wife, I say.

333
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,080
走啊，伯尔顿太太
Come on, Mrs. B.

334
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,340
- 我的脑子都不转了  - 不想赢光我所有的钱啦？
- Can't think straight.  - Don't you want to win all my money?

335
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:49,050
- 天太晚了  - 别埋怨
- It's late.  - Don't complain.

336
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,200
将军
Check.

337
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,540
太好了
Very good.

338
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,210
天快亮了，你想睡的话，就去睡吧
It must be early light now. you can go to bed if you like.

339
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,880
走之前把窗帘拉开，好吗？
Open the curtains before you leave, would you?

340
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,840
- 你们把这些东西拿到哪儿去？ - 克利夫德先生吩咐
- Where are you taking this?  - Sir Clifford's instructions.

341
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,130
- “把它们埋藏到阁楼上”  - 他在哪儿呢？
- " Bury it in the attic," he said.  - Where is he?

342
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:56,050
- 和两位先生在书房里  - 谢谢，菲尔德
- With two gentlemen in the library.  - Thank you, Field.

343
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:01,180
我认为现在正是时机，但我们必须把设备现代化
Now is the right time, but we simply must have the bits modernised.

344
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:07,190
特别是橡树林矿，因为我们可以最大限度地开采…
Especially the Oakwood Pit. We can exploit that to the last possibility...

345
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,610
- 早上好  - 各位，这是我妻子
- Good morning, everybody.  - Gentlemen, my wife.

346
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,530
你好
How do you do?

347
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,410
亲爱的，能不能让我们安安静静说会话？拜托！
Darling, would you let us talk in peace? Please!

348
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,990
刚才说到哪儿了？
Now, where were we?

349
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,250
坐下吧
Sit down.

350
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,620
- 我做错什么了吗？ - 没有
- Have I done something wrong?  - No.

351
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,840
你觉得和我在一起贬低自己了吗？
you think you've lowered yourself with me?

352
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,630
没有
No.

353
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,600
使劲！好，另一侧
Push! Good. And the other side.

354
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,560
使劲，使劲
And push, push.

355
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:32,980
你必须让肩膀使劲，休息一下
you must strengthen these shoulders. And rest.

356
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:41,070
- 你真的觉得有希望吗？ - 你相信我吗？
- Do you really think there's hope?  - Do you trust me?

357
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,070
- 相信，伯尔顿太太  - 那好，咱们再来
- yes, Mrs. B.  - Well, then, try again.

358
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,080
向上抬，使劲
Lift and push.

359
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,250
好，就这样，好
Good, good, good.

360
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,330
休息一下，好
And rest. Good.

361
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,050
我觉得你好可爱
you're lovely to me.

362
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:03,430
- 摸起来好舒服  - 不要哭
- So lovely to touch.  - Don't cry.

363
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,760
我曾读过这样一段话
I read something one day:

364
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:14,480
“我要经历人生中的一切
" I will experience everything in life...

365
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,400
这样，当我走上通往死亡的最后旅程
...so on the final journey to my death...

366
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,610
我的夜晚就不会被懊悔吞噬”
...the nights will not be haunted by regret."

367
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,410
所以用不着哭
So no need to cry.

368
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,420
别担心，这真的很幸福
Don't worry, it's really happiness.

369
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,010
人都去哪儿了？
Where are the others?

370
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,560
克利夫德先生在书房，不让别人打扰他
Sir Clifford is in the library and asked not to be disturbed.

371
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,600
伯尔顿太太在午睡
Mrs. Bolton is taking a nap.

372
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,860
- 那这是专门为我准备的了  - 是的，夫人
- Well, it will be just for me, then.  - yes, milady.

373
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,360
这份杂志是你的
This magazine came for you.

374
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,030
康妮
Connie.

375
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,700
我亲爱的的康妮，你很开心吧？
My darling Connie. Are you happy?

376
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:56,330
- 怎么了？ - 因为你的样子非常可爱
- Why?  - Because you look so adorable.

377
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,540
如果你不开心，我会受不了的
I couldn't bear it if you were unhappy.

378
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,630
你太好心了
So kind.

379
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:07,340
我真心认为我应该死去，他们应该让我死
I honestly think I should have died. They should have let me.

380
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:14,260
克利夫德，别这样，如果某种东西失去了，那并不意味着全部失去
Clifford, don't. If something is lost, it needn't be all lost, need it?

381
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:18,730
如果没人想要我活，那我就没有理由活下去
There's no reason for me to live if nobody wants me to live.

382
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,360
刚才看见你在那里，我就想
Just seeing you there then...

383
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,530
如果我死了，你就可以解脱了，可能你也清楚这点
...I thought you'd be better off if I were dead. Perhaps you knew it.

384
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,410
我不想让你死
I don't want you to die...

385
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:34,990
可如果让我为你的生死承担责任，那就太残酷了
...but it is cruel to make me responsible for your living.

386
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,830
你自己想活，对不对？
you want to live, don't you?

387
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,170
亲爱的，对不起
Darling, I'm sorry.

388
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,300
我太无情了
I'm a real brute.

389
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,260
别哭，别因为…
Don't cry. Don't...

390
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,430
我的自私而哭，
...for my selfish sake.

391
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,100
我不值得你这样
I'm not worthy of you.

392
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,730
在这儿等着’，迈勒斯
Wait here, Mellors.

393
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:11,280
你来这儿干什么？
What are you doing here?

394
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,080
迈勒斯，有什么事吗？
yes, Mellors, what is it?

395
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:25,460
我今天早上抓到两个偷猎者，还带着夹子和野兔
I caught a couple of poachers, sir, with snares and rabbits, this morning.

396
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,380
- 他们在哪儿  - 在外面，先生
- Where are they?  - Outside, sir.

397
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:41,560
我该怎么处置他们？
What should I do about them?

398
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,310
- 起诉  - 是，先生
- Prosecute.  - yes, sir.

399
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,650
有必要起诉吗？
Is it necessary to prosecute them?

400
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:53,410
偷猎野兔有必要吗？干这种事有必要吗？
Is it necessary to poach rabbits? Or anything else for that matter?

401
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,620
如果不起诉，满树林都是他们了
They'd be all over the wood if we didn't prosecute.

402
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,250
- 你们以前都是矿工吧？ - 是的，夫人
- you were colliers, weren't you?  - yes, milady.

403
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,790
你看，他们偷猎是因为饥饿…
you see, they're poaching because they're hungry...

404
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,250
夫人阁下说得对
Her ladyship is right.

405
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,340
我们不起诉了，放了他们
We won't prosecute. Let them go.

406
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,140
- 不过要先打一顿  - 克利夫德！
- After you've thrashed them.  - Clifford!

407
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,900
他要么打他们，要么结柬自己在这儿的工作
He'll thrash them, or he'll consider his employment here ended.

408
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,830
过去
Go on.

409
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,710
好！
Good!

410
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,810
谢谢，迈勒斯
Thank you, Mellors.

411
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,200
走吧
Come on, then.

412
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,280
- 你迟到了  - 我故意的
- you're late.  - I meant to be.

413
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:42,620
- 不是你想让我来的吗？ - 不是你自己想来才来的吗？
- Didn't you want me here?  - Is it only to be when you want?

414
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:46,160
偷猎者的事你觉得无所谓吗？
What happened to those poachers didn't bother you?

415
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:50,330
- 你好像无所谓呀  - 我能不服从命令吗？
- It didn't seem to bother you.  - Should I have disobeyed him?

416
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,310
即使这样，你也会打他们的
you would have beaten them anyway.

417
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,380
- 即便这样  - 你怎么了？夫人
- Even so.  - Even so, milady.

418
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,850
好啦，对不起
Okay, I'm sorry.

419
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,810
你现在够了
Good.

420
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:21,950
今天快多了，再做两个
Faster today. A couple more.

421
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,410
很好
That's good.

422
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,080
说实话，刚开始的时候
To be honest, when we started...

423
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:36,340
我没抱什么希望
...I thought it was hopeless.

424
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,510
可现在我觉得你能行
But now I think you can do it.

425
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,760
- 要是有了孩子怎么办？ - 我很愿意有孩子
- What happens if you have a child?  - I should like to have a child.

426
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,390
那克利夫德先生呢？
What about Sir Clifford?

427
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,530
克利夫德说过这事
Clifford talked about it.

428
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,660
- 他想要子嗣  - 什么？
- He wants a son and heir.  - What?

429
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,660
他知道我？
He knows about me?

430
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,160
不
No.

431
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,160
如果有了孩子，你会告诉他吗？
If you have a child, you'll tell him?

432
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,960
如果他怀疑你，我就不得不离开
If he ever suspects about you, I'd have to go away.

433
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,460
为什么？
What for?

434
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,050
离开你我活不下去
I couldn't live without you...

435
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,180
可如果他知道了你，我就无法和他生活下去
...but I couldn't live with him if he knew about you.

436
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:38,730
如果你走了，再也见不到我了，你会焦虑不安吗？
Wouldn't fret if you went away and never saw me again?

437
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,110
是的，我会在意，会焦虑不安
yes, I'd mind. I'd fret.

438
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,660
- 你会在意吗？ - 是的，我会
- Should you mind?  - Aye, that I would.

439
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:00,840
我想让要你骗一次人，去我的小屋过一夜，就一次
I should like you to lie one night with me at my cottage, just for once.

440
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:07,470
我必须要走了
I must go now.

441
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:28,740
对不起，夫人
Sorry, milady.

442
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:33,620
- 克利夫德先生呢？  - 在书房
- Where's Sir Clifford?  - In the library.

443
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:36,960
- 也许他没听见  - 我去告诉他
- Perhaps he didn't hear.  - I'll tell him.

444
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:38,960
夫人
Milady.

445
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,410
- 你不想吃晚餐吗？ - 想，我饿极了
- Aren't you coming in to dinner?  - yes, I'm starving.

446
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,660
我只是想把这些计划做完
I just want to finish with these plans.

447
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:17,540
什么计划？煤矿的？
What is it, the mine?

448
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,000
我无法开创一个朝代，无法像雷诺阿那样画画
I can't father a dynasty. I can't paint like Renoir.

449
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:24,250
但我可以做企业，康妮
It has to be business, Con.

450
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,550
查泰莱家族的姓氏一定要永远流传
Immortality must be the name Chatterley.

451
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,130
咱们就从煤矿开始
We start with the mine.

452
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:32,970
你在听我说话吗？
Are you listening to me?

453
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,980
咱们必须先在收入和资本方面做出牺牲
We'll have to make sacrifices in income and capital...

454
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,310
因为我们要进行现代化改造
...because we must modernise it.

455
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,860
晚安，克利夫德
Good night, Clifford.

456
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:51,740
晚安，康妮，睡个好觉
Good night, Con. Sleep well.

457
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,770
我真怕你今天不来了，
I was scared you wouldn't come today.

458
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,600
你为什么要找我这样一个下等人？
What do you come to a fellow like me for?

459
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:26,360
因为你可以想要就要，不想要就不要吗？
Because you can take it or leave it as you please?

460
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:29,030
我见过你一次，当时你在洗澡
I saw you once, washing.

461
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,030
- 我觉得你很美  - 我？
- I thought you were beautiful.  - Me?

462
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,290
你的身体很美，我想要你
your body was beautiful. I wanted you.

463
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,410
我的身体，很美？
My body, beautiful?

464
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:42,830
是你觉得吧？跟那些上层美少年比吗？
To you? As knows all the tiptop young fellas?

465
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,630
- 我说的不是漂亮  - 心灵美才是真美
- I don't mean handsome.  - Handsome is as handsome does.

466
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,420
你对我并不认真，对吧？
you don't take me serious, do you?

467
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:52,720
我在你面前是什么人？你们的人会怎么说？
What am I to you? What do your sort say?

468
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,720
说我是“鸭”？
A fucker?

469
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:58,260
不，是情人
No, lover.

470
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,180
你是我的情人
you are my lover.

471
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:11,240
你就是没结婚，也不会嫁给我
you wouldn't marry me if you was free.

472
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,610
你也不想让我嫁给你
you wouldn't want me to.

473
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,450
如果你不是高高在上的话，我会的
If you weren't above me, I should.

474
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,700
可你高高在上，看不起我
But you're above. you look down on me.

475
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:25,000
不，我非常感谢你
No, I'm grateful to you.

476
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,170
我也是
And me, I am too.

477
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,670
和你在一起超爽，可我说的不是这个
This is extra, but I don't mean this.

478
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,300
等你的时候
When I wait...

479
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:41,770
我望着空地那头，你没有来，我对自己说
...I look across the grounds and you don't come, I say:

480
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,600
“老兄，她今天不想要你
"She wants none of you today, lad.

481
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:48,060
还是拿着猎枪回去吧”
you best hang up your gun and go home."

482
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:50,520
- 你根本不拿我当回事  - 不对
- you think nothing of me.  - I do.

483
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:52,690
根本不在乎我
Not me.

484
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,700
你喜欢的只是这事
It's this you enjoy.

485
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:01,450
就是这样
And that's all.

486
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,960
就是这样
And that's all.

487
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,510
不，你错了
No, you're wrong.

488
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,930
我真的爱你
I do love you.

489
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:25,480
我要去你的小屋和你一起睡，我一定要去
And I want to sleep with you in your cottage, and I will.

490
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:27,400
什么时候
When?

491
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,070
我想听你对我说，我的身体很美
I want you to tell me my body is beautiful.

492
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,070
我想做你的妻子，可我不能离开克利夫德
I would be your wife, but I can't leave Clifford.

493
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,200
他明白我需要有人
He understands I need somebody. you.

494
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,960
你难道不明白我需要他吗？
Don't you understand I need him?

495
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,000
如果他知道那个人是我，他会怎么说？
What would he say if he knew it were me?

496
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:52,590
不知道，我永远不会告诉他
I don't know. I'll never tell him.

497
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:57,760
你永远不会告诉他，因为你知道那样就会马上失去他
you'd never tell him, because you know you'd lose him right enough.

498
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,760
这和你我的阶级毫无关系
It's nothing to do with class.

499
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:06,180
有关系，有着数不清的关系
It's got everything to do with it. Everything.

500
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:08,890
那我们还是说再见吧
Then we'd better say goodbye.

501
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:16,110
你给我的远远超过我给你的
you've given me more than I've ever given you.

502
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:20,950
你肯定非常恨我
you must really hate me.

503
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,120
我以后再也不来了
I mustn't come here anymore.

504
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,540
等等，我不想让你走
Wait, I don't want you to go.

505
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:32,630
说点什么吧，让我一直想着，直到下次你再来
Say something that will keep until you come back here.

506
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:34,550
要我我说什么？
What shall I say?

507
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:39,050
说你永远不会断绝我们之间的关系
Say you'll never break it off between us.

508
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,430
我永远不会
I never will.

509
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,560
咱们去让这话合法
Then let's make it legal.

510
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:59,280
你愿不愿意把钉子永远钉进这棵树？
Will you drive your nail into this tree for good and all?

511
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,700
是的，我愿意
Yes, I am willing to

512
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,100
- 你什么时候和我一起过夜？ - 很快
- When will you stay the night with me?  - Soon.

513
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:54,750
- 你在这儿干什么？ - 我一直在看落日
- What are you doing?  - I've been watching the sunset.

514
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,050
可以了
That's all right.

515
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,880
你今天要却哪儿？
Where are you going today?

516
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:48,140
去林子里，看看小鸡孵出来没有
I'm going to the woods, see if the chicks have hatched.

517
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,650
能帮我把门打开吗？’
Can you open the gate for me?

518
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:14,620
谢谢
Thank you.

519
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:23,210
干嘛带他来？我一直以为在这林子里你是我的老婆
Why have you brought him? I thought you're to be my wife in the woods.

520
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,630
到这儿来是他的主意
It was his idea to come here.

521
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:35,230
他知道了？
Well, he knows?

522
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,980
- 不会的  - 他肯定起疑心了
- He can't.  - He must be suspicious.

523
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,030
康妮！
Connie!

524
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:55,080
你最好早点去我的小屋，以防万一
you'd better come to the cottage soon, just in case.

525
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:59,880
- 今天夜里  - 好，今天夜里
- Tonight.  - Aye, tonight.

526
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:07,840
- 康妮，你到底去哪儿了？ - 我来了
- Connie, where the devil are you?  - I'm coming.

527
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:09,930
好了
It's all right.

528
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:13,560
我还以为我会陷进去呢
I thought I was going to sink in, that's all.

529
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,530
使劲，推，推呀！
Come on. Push, push!

530
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:36,790
不行，咱们陷住了
It's no good. We're stuck.

531
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:41,170
迈勒斯！
Mellors!

532
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,420
迈勒斯！
Mellors!

533
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:55,140
迈勒斯，我是不是让什么东西绊住了？
Mellors. am I caught up somewhere?

534
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,690
是这样，先生
I should say you are, sir.

535
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:03,520
- 要我帮你推出去吗？ - 不用，让发动机来吧
- Shall I give you a push?  - No, let the motor do it.

536
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:05,570
我再试一下
I'll try again.

537
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:14,490
好吧，你来推吧
yes, you can push.

538
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:26,130
使劲，推呀！
Come on, man, push!

539
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,300
推呀！
Push!

540
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,890
推呀，迈勒斯！
Push, Mellors!

541
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,930
使劲！推呀！
Come on! Push.

542
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,140
快点，使劲推呀！
Come on. Put your back into it, man.

543
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:45,940
- 你是不是拉着闸呢，先生？ - 当然没有
- Have you got the brake on, sir?  - No, of course not.

544
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,940
等一下
Wait a minute.

545
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:54,570
齿轮坏了
The gears have gone.

546
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:57,490
你得把我推回去了
you'll have to push me in neutral.

547
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,410
帮他一把，康妮
Well, give him a hand, Connie.

548
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:12,970
处处让人同情真是太不好意思了
It is a shame to be at the mercy of anyone.

549
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,820
伯尔顿太太，请去叫一下纽曼
Mrs. Bolton, can you send for Newman?

550
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,240
不用麻烦他了，迈勒斯可依抱我
Don't bother him. Mellors can carry me.

551
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,240
- 对不起，迈勒斯？  - 是的，先生
- Can't you, Mellors?  - yes, sir.

552
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,080
康妮，把我的轮椅清洗干净，好吗？
Connie, tidy my chair away, will you?

553
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:54,840
我并不是很重吧，迈勒斯？
Not too heavy am I, Mellors?

554
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,690
别碰！
Don't touch those!

555
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,150
非常感谢，，迈勒斯
Thanks awfully, Mellors.

556
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,230
谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir.

557
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:14,030
- 出去散步很好吧？  - 是的，非常感谢
- Did you enjoy your walk?  - yes, thank you very much.

558
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,820
他真是个好人，你说是不是？
He's really quite a good sort, don't you think?

559
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,790
伯尔顿太太，请让菲尔德准备帮我洗澡
Mrs. B, ask Field to run me a bath, will you?

560
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:28,000
他觉得自己微不足道，像美国人说的，值不了几粒豆子
He thinks he's the whole hill of beans, as the Americans say.

561
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,920
他那种人
People like him...

562
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:35,380
即使伯尔顿太太那么好的人
...even Mrs. Bolton, nice as she is...

563
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:38,180
对我们也没有真正的尊敬
...they've no real respect for us.

564
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:42,010
也许只尊敬我们所拥有的，而不是我们的人
For what we've got, perhaps, not what we are.

565
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:45,810
他们应该尊敬吗？我们尊敬他们的人吗？
Ought they to? Do we respect them for what they are?

566
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,980
除了为我们干活，他们还有什么？
What are they, apart from what they do for us?

567
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:52,320
你能呼唤他们的道德灵魂吗？
Would you raise a shout about his soul?

568
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,400
只不过是行尸走肉
He's just so much live human meat.

569
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:57,820
谢谢，伯尔顿太太
Thank you, Mrs. B.

570
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,870
你真的来了
So you've come, then?

571
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,120
你都看见了
Obviously.

572
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:00,380
没事吧？你真的想来吧？
Is it all right? you wanted to come?

573
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:03,720
当然了，否则我不会来的
Of course. Otherwise I wouldn't.

574
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:07,470
我很高兴
I'm glad you did.

575
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,730
我真是太高兴了
I'm so glad you did.

576
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:26,490
这里很温馨舒适
It's cosy in here.

577
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,600
- 好漂亮  - 哦，你说花呀
- They're pretty.  - The flowers.

578
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,360
- 她就是这样的  - 谁？
- So that's what she looks like.  - Who?

579
01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:00,610
- 这是你妻子，对吧？ - 你怎么知道？
- It is your wife, isn't it?  - How do you know?

580
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,410
我知道你的不少事
I know a lot about you.

581
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:07,080
咱们来这儿可不是聊她的
Well, we didn't come here to talk about her.

582
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:11,040
当然不是，可我不能不想到她
No, but I have to think about her.

583
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:14,120
不管怎么说，你肯定曾经爱过他
After all, you must have liked her once.

584
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:19,670
她跑了，她现在不是我的妻子，这事已经结束了
She ran off. She's not my wife now, so there's an end to it.

585
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,260
康妮？
Connie?

586
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,970
你疯了
you're crazy.

587
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:05,060
你就像是夜晚的一座雕像
you look a figure out here in the night.

588
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:09,600
- 我还漂亮吗？ - 漂亮，在月光下
- am I still beautiful?  - Aye, under the moon.

589
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:13,360
在这个世界上，你比月亮还漂亮
you're more of the moon than this world.

590
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:20,490
天空是真实的，树林是真实的，你也是真实的
The sky is real, the woods are real, and you are real.

591
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:33,170
- 在林子里，我是你的妻子  - 在哪里你都是我妻子
- I am your wife in the woods.  - Aye, my wife anywhere.

592
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:35,920
我以前从没有过妻子
I never had a wife before.

593
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:39,630
从来不知道女人什么样
I never knew what a woman was like before.

594
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:40,290
天亮了
It's day.

595
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,840
咱们还有时间
We have time.

596
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:50,640
我现在知道了和人睡在一起是怎么回事
Now I know what it's like to sleep with someone.

597
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,680
- 什么？ - 没什么？
- What?  - Nothing.

598
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:00,730
我得走了
I should go now.

599
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:05,940
和我在一起吧
Stay with me.

600
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,360
真冷
It's cold.

601
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:14,950
- 怎么了？ - 我算什么人？
- What's wrong?  - What sort of man am I?

602
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:20,330
让一个不能动的人呼来唤去背地里操他的老婆
Running around at the call of a paralysed man and fucking his wife.

603
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,880
对你来说，我算什么人？
What sort of a mate am I for you?

604
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:26,380
除了做爱，你还尊敬我什么？
How can you respect me except for fucking?

605
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:32,430
- 而做爱，人人都会  - 听着，没有人会那样做
- And almost anyone would do for that.  - Here, no other man would do for that.

606
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:38,060
我不能进入你的圈子，你也不能进入我的
I can't go among your people, you can't come to mine.

607
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:43,600
- 所有这些社会上的东西重要吗？ - 是的，重要
- Does all that social stuff matter?  - Aye, it matters.

608
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:45,650
有多重要？
How much?

609
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,570
这么重要？
This much?

610
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,150
这么重要？
This much?

611
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:57,240
你得走了
you must go.

612
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:23,310
咱们以后还要这样
We'll have another time like this.

613
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,170
克利夫德？
Clifford?

614
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,550
克利夫德
Clifford.

615
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:02,520
你可以告诉我这都不是真的
you could tell me it's all untrue.

616
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:08,060
“去吧，康妮，如果愿意，就去找个男人，只是不要离开我”
"Go ahead, Connie. Take a man if you wish, only never leave me."

617
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:14,200
- 找个男人，康妮，而不是可恶的…  - 农民？奴隶？
- A man, Connie, not a damn...  - Peasant? Slave?

618
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:18,160
你要是怀孕了怎么办，夫人？好好想想
What if you got pregnant, milady? Think of that.

619
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:20,450
想想我
Think of me.

620
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:23,160
想想将来
Think of the future.

621
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:29,670
我想过会是什么人，可那该死的奥利弗·迈勒斯…
I thought of who it might be, but that damned Oliver Mellors....

622
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:32,960
奥利弗，他的名字？
Oliver, is it?

623
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:37,970
你连他的名字都没问过
you never even asked his name.

624
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:44,270
我已经把你的事情都安排好了，给你姐姐发了电报
I've made all the arrangements. I sent a telegram to your sister...

625
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,560
告诉她，你坐十点半的火车去伦敦
...you'll be on the 10:30 train to London...

626
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:51,110
三点半轮船从维多利亚出发
...and the 3:30 boat train on from Victoria.

627
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:56,740
我们都需要时间考虑一下
We both need time to think.

628
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:07,170
- 一路顺风，夫人  - 谢谢，菲尔德
- Have a good journey, milady.  - Thank you, Field.

629
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,050
能不能帮我做件事？
Could you do something for me?

630
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,970
请告诉迈勒斯一声
Please tell Mellors.

631
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:15,980
亲爱的，我能离开我丈夫，你也能离开你丈夫
Darling, if I left my husband, you can leave yours.

632
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:21,030
你已经和那个看守猎场的人走出了第一步
you've made the first move with this gamekeeper chap.

633
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:25,990
为什么第二步、第羞步、第四步就那么困难呢？
Why are the second, third and fourth moves so difficult?

634
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,960
对你来说很容易，对我来说没那么容易
It's not as easy for me as it is for you.

635
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:34,590
我不喜欢看到你这个样子，我会让你重新微笑
I don't like seeing you like this. I'll make you smile again.

636
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:38,510
请在这儿等我一会儿，好吗？
Can you wait for me here, please?

637
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:44,430
康妮，看看我给你找来了什么？
Connie, look what I've found for you.

638
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,060
你想要哪个？
Which one do you want?

639
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:52,690
哪个都不想要，你都留着吧，一会儿见
Not for me. Have them both. I'll see you later.

640
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:37,270
听见我说话了吗？你怎么一言不发地总站在这里？
Are you listening? How can you stand it here all the time?

641
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:42,110
我喜欢在这儿，这让我左右为难的窘境显得更为英勇
I quite enjoy it here. It makes my dilemma seem even more heroic.

642
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,910
左右为难？这儿有你一封信
Dilemma? This letter's arrived for you.

643
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:51,080
希望是好消息
I hope that it's good news.

644
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,210
咱们一会儿见
I'll see you in a minute.

645
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:24,320
康妮，亲爱的，走啊
Connie, dear, come on.

646
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:27,370
你不想游泳吗？
Don't you want to go swimming?

647
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,180
说实话，康妮，你太让人扫兴了
Honestly, Connie, you're such a bore.

648
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:56,520
克利夫德安排你远走国外
Clifford arranges it by sending you into exile...

649
01:34:56,690 --> 01:35:01,770
可大家都做的事，你偏不做
...and all you do is the exact opposite of what everyone else wants to do.

650
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:05,240
怀孕的女人是可以胡思乱想的
Pregnant women are allowed their whims.

651
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:10,570
- 你不可能怀孕  - 我怀孕了，刚看过医生
- you can't be pregnant.  - I am. I've seen a doctor.

652
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:14,700
这太可怕了
Absolutely awful.

653
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:18,670
可我觉得这是最好的喜事
It's the best thing that ever happened to me.

654
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,000
别傻了
Don't be silly.

655
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:26,170
- 我们该拿你和那个怎么办？  - 送我回英国
- What will we do with you and it?  - Get me back to England.

656
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:53,280
- 克利夫德  - 等一下
- Clifford?  - Wait.

657
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:57,540
- 欢迎回家，夫人  - 你好
- Welcome back, milady.  - Hello.

658
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:04,750
这是不是奇迹？都是伯尔顿太太的功劳
Isn't it simply wonderful? And all Mrs. B's doing.

659
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:11,640
我的鼓励，克利夫德先生，主要是你的意志力
My encouragement, perhaps, Sir Clifford, your will-power.

660
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:33,120
当心！没事吧？
Be careful! Are you all right?

661
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:38,370
真是费了大劲了，不过确实值得
It's the devil of an effort but really worth it.

662
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:42,000
- 最袁的成就是下到了矿井里  - 什么？
- Going down the mine was the triumph.  - What?

663
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:45,540
我在信上都写了，你没收到我的信吗？
I wrote you about it. Didn't you get my letters?

664
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:48,340
我把所有事情都写信告诉你了
I wrote you about everything.

665
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:00,850
奥利弗？
Oliver?

666
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:05,900
夫人？哦，他已经不在这儿工作了
Milady? Oh, he don't work here no more.

667
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,190
有什么重要的事吗？
Was it anything important?

668
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,700
没有，谢谢，对不起打扰你了
No, thank you. I'm sorry to have troubled you.

669
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:30,090
- 迈勒斯出什么事了？ - 他走了，克利夫德先生解雇了他
- What's happened to Mellors?  - He's gone. Sir Clifford dismissed him.

670
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,130
明白了
I see.

671
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:35,300
克利夫德，你最好把一切都告诉我
you'd better tell me everything.

672
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:37,260
- 告诉什么？  - 迈勒斯的事
- About what?  - Mellors.

673
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:39,430
迈勒斯？
Mellors?

674
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:43,310
我给你的信上都写了
I wrote you about it. It was in my letters.

675
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,270
你的信我没看，快告诉我
I didn't read your letters. Tell me.

676
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:50,070
我还以为你因为那个原因不回信呢
I thought you didn't answer them, because of that.

677
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,820
听说你要回来，我还以为你原谅了我
When I heard you were coming back, I thought you'd forgiven me.

678
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:57,580
因为什么原因？
Because of what?

679
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:01,330
他确实不想留在这儿
He didn't want to stay.

680
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:06,380
你送走了我，解雇了他，我真不敢相信
you sent me away, and you dismissed him. I can't believe it.

681
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:10,500
我不想让你太痴迷他
I didn't want you to become too fond of him.

682
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:14,470
我知道我们达成过一致，你可以有情人
I know we agreed about you having a lover...

683
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:19,260
但我这样做是因为你，是为了减轻你的痛苦
...but I did it because of you, to save you pain.

684
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:22,520
毕竟我们讨论过子嗣的事
After all, we did talk about a son and heir...

685
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:25,020
如果你见他的次数太多
...and if you'd saw too much of him...

686
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:28,230
谁知道顶我姓氏的会是什么杂种
...who knows what bastards I'd give my name.

687
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:32,990
- 你的姓氏  - 康妮，你清楚我的立场
- your name.  - Con, surely you understand my position.

688
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:35,360
克利夫德，我怀孕了
Clifford, I'm pregnant.

689
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:39,410
他是孩子的父亲，你的姓氏完了
He's the father, and your name be damned.

690
01:38:56,220 --> 01:39:00,850
告诉你吧，在煤矿外面干活越来越难了
I tell you, love, work outside the mine is getting hard to come by.

691
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:15,650
- 你来这儿干什么？ - 我刚回来
- What are you doing here?  - I just got back.

692
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:18,820
- 是吗？你想干什么？ - 拜托…
- Did you, now? What do you want?  - Please...

693
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:23,120
听着，这一切已经不可能了，事情已经结束了
Look, it can't be the way it was, so there's an end to it.

694
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:26,210
你不想再要我了吗？
But don't you want me anymore?

695
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:38,090
我想和你在一起
I want to be with you.

696
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:42,890
我不想在我的一生中没有你
I don't want to miss you all my life.

697
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:49,190
如果你真恨我，为什么还要为查泰菜家干苦力？
If you hate me, how can you still slave for the Chatterleys?

698
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,360
- 听说过加拿大吗？ - 什么？
- Have you heard of Canada?  - What?

699
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:56,440
加拿大，每周十四镑工钱，我在为自己挣路费
Canada, 14 pounds a week. I'm working to earn my fare.

700
01:39:56,610 --> 01:40:00,200
- 听我说，我都计划好了  - 不
- Listen to me, I've got it all planned...  - No.

701
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:03,330
你怎么会喜欢我这种人？
How can you like the likes of me?

702
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:08,660
- 奥利弗，我怀孕了  - 他妈的
- Oliver, I'm pregnant.  - Damn you.

703
01:40:08,910 --> 01:40:12,500
你得到了你想要的，克利夫德先生得到了孩子
you got what you want, and Sir Clifford gets a child.

704
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:16,090
不，孩子会姓我娘家姓，或是你的姓
No, it will have my maiden name or your name.

705
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:20,300
不会再有姓查泰菜的人了，克利夫德是最后一个
There will be no other Chatterley. Clifford is the last.

706
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:23,390
不管你和不和我在一起，我都会离开他
I'll leave him, whether you come or not.

707
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:27,770
咱们去哪儿？咱们干什么？我能干什么？
And where will we go? What will we do? What will I do?

708
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:31,060
你可以经营自己的农场
you could run your own farm.

709
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:35,070
- 怎么经营？ - 可以用我的收入
- How?  - We could use my income.

710
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:40,030
你看不到自己活得像个奴隶吗？
Can't you see you live like a slave?

711
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:44,410
- 我让自己自由了，你也可以  - 我不做吃软饭的男人
- I've made myself free. you can too.  - I'll not be a kept man.

712
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:49,410
我们的孩子，不属于哪个阶级，是你我最好部分的结合
And our child, no class. The best of you, the best of me.

713
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:51,540
你还记得吗？
Do you remember?

714
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:55,880
“我的夜晚就不会被懊悔吞噬”
"My nights will not be haunted by regrets."

715
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:09,850
- 你真的觉得我很美？ - 你就是很美
- So you really think I'm beautiful?  - you are.

716
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:15,900
- 还有多长时间？ - 七个月
- How long to go?  - Seven months.

717
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:20,490
咱们等着吧，等着吧
We'll see, we'll see.

718
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:29,240
康妮？
Connie?
