1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,341
之前在那些即将死去的人身上......

1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,341
VESPASIAN: Previously
on Those About To Die...

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,646
谷物是故意拖延的，

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,646
PORTO: The grain was delayed
intentionally,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,548
和谣言说弗拉维安

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,548
and rumors that a Flavian

4
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,817
-是粮食短缺的幕后推手.......弗拉维安人？

4
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,817
-was behind the food shortages.
-TITUS: A Flavian?

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,186
 图密善，如果他成为皇帝，

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,186
ANTONIA: Domitian, were he
to become Emperor,

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,222
那将是我们所有人的终结。

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,222
that would be the end
of all of us.

7
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,256
是的！

7
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,256
Yes!

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:40,106
嗯，公民们，为罗马服务

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:40,106
Um, the citizens,
and to serve Rome

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,475
我将带来我们竞选活动的荣耀......

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,475
I will bring the glory
of our campaigns...

12
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,610
不 不 不。

12
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,610
No, no, no.

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,079
呃......嗯。

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,079
Um... Hmm.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,850
正如我在遥远的战场上为罗马服务一样......不。

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,850
As I have served Rome
on distant battlefields... No.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,285
是的，它是什么？

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,285
Yes, what is it?

16
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,723
也许，一个建议？

16
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,723
Perhaps, a suggestion?

17
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,691
是的，建议。

17
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,691
VESPASIAN: Yes, words.

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,626
说说你的建议，你善于言辞。

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,626
Give me the words.
You're good with words.

19
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,331
我。。。

19
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,331
I...

20
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,701
提图斯·弗拉维乌斯·维斯帕西亚努斯...

20
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,701
Titus Flavius Vespasianus...

21
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,336
我听不见。大声！

21
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,336
I can't hear you. Louder!

23
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,475
我。。。

23
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,475
I...

24
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,379
提图斯·弗拉维乌斯·维斯帕西亚努斯

24
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,379
Titus Flavius Vespasianus

25
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,683
戴上铁环。

25
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,683
wear an iron ring.

26
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,654
不是金子，

26
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,654
Not gold,

27
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,689
不是银，

27
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,689
not silver,

28
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,193
没有镶嵌宝石。

28
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,193
not encrusted
with precious stones.

29
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,462
铁，犁的东西，

29
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,462
Iron, the stuff of the plough,

30
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,597
还有短剑，

30
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,597
and the gladius,

31
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,902
还有骡子嘴里的那块

31
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,902
and the bit in the mouths
of the mules

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,671
我的父亲和祖父养育了。

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,671
my father and grandfather bred.

33
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,144
尼禄皇帝，贵族

33
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,144
Emperor Nero of late,
a patrician

34
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,279
八月家族，

34
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,279
of august family,

35
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,216
他戴着金子。

35
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,216
he wore gold.

36
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,287
他建造了金宫，

36
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,287
He built the Domus Aurea,

37
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,958
有史以来最宏伟的房子

37
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,958
the grandest house
ever to be built

38
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,660
在陆地上，他从他的公民那里偷走了。

38
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,660
on land he stole
from his citizens.

39
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:18,271
我，提图斯·弗拉维乌斯·维斯帕西亚努斯，

39
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:18,271
I, Titus Flavius Vespasianus,

40
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,974
将拆毁那个金宫

40
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,974
will tear down that Domus Aurea

41
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,678
-石头，用石头。

41
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,678
-stone, by stone.
-(VESPASIAN CHUCKLES)

42
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,347
取而代之的是，我将建造一个圆形剧场。

42
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,347
And in its place,
I shall build an amphitheater.

43
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,583
不是为了这个城市的主人，

43
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,583
Not for the masters
of this city,

44
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,356
而是为了娱乐和快乐

44
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,356
but for the entertainment
and pleasure

45
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,224
为众民。

45
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,224
of the citizenry.

46
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:44,731
铁人，他们的鲜血和辛劳

46
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:44,731
The men of iron
whose blood and toil

47
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,736
建造了这个，我们的罗马城。

47
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,736
built this, our city of Rome.

48
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,483
太不可思议了。

48
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,483
I am stunned.

49
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,752
想想我以为你的修辞老师

49
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,752
And to think I thought
your instructors in rhetoric

50
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,354
被多付了钱。

50
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,354
were overpaid.

51
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,393
而圆形剧场，是不是突然有了悟？

51
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,393
And the amphitheater,
was that a sudden insight?

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,331
不，我已经考虑了一段时间。

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,331
No, I've been considering it
for a while.

53
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,533
还有什么更好的方法来削弱马克西姆斯竞技场的力量

53
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,533
What better way to sap power
from the Circus Maximus

54
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,635
还有那些如此憎恨我们上升的贵族？

54
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,635
and the patricians
who so resent our ascent?

55
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,437
是的。

55
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,437
Yeah.

56
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,507
好吧，也许你已经指挥了我的一只翅膀。

56
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,507
Well, perhaps you already
command one of my wings.

57
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,310
政治的。

57
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,310
The political one.

58
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,826
这就是我想象中的样子。

58
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,826
DOMITIAN:
It's just how I imagined it.

59
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,662
浩瀚无垠，无以复加。

59
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,662
Vast beyond all comprehension.

60
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,832
尼禄从来不理解暴徒。

60
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,832
Nero never understood the mob.

61
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,038
他太专注于建造他愚蠢的金屋了

61
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,038
He was too focused on building
his stupid Golden House

62
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,874
拥有无尽的花园和水景，

62
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,874
with its endless gardens
and water features,

63
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,342
并弹奏他的七弦琴。

63
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,342
and playing his lyre.

64
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,313
我父亲在他一场乏味的音乐会上睡着了，

64
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,313
My father fell asleep
in one of his tedious concerts,

65
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,549
尼禄禁止他进入宫廷

65
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,549
and Nero banned him
from his court

66
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,351
并派他去犹太发动战争。

66
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,351
and sent him to wage war
in Judea.

67
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,589
最后，自杀是尼禄最后也是唯一的选择。

67
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,589
In the end, suicide
was Nero's last and only option.

68
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,658
他需要得到帮助。

68
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,658
And he needed
to be helped with that.

70
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,708
一个年轻的头脑发热的人。

70
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,708
A young hothead.

71
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,011
拜托了，伟大的图密善。

71
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,011
Please, Great Domitian.

72
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,846
明白他是单独行动的。

72
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,846
Understand he acted alone.

74
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,495
天哪，我迟到了。

74
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,495
By the gods, I'm late.

75
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,535
我什么时候能再见到你？

75
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,535
When can I see you again?

76
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,903
当我可以离开时。

76
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,903
When I can get away.

77
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,572
中午？傍晚？

77
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,572
Midday? Evening?

78
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,073
今晚？

78
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,073
Tonight?

79
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,575
我们在一起将近五个星期，

79
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,575
We are nearly
five weeks together,

80
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,044
而你能想到的就是做爱吗？

80
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,044
and all you can think of
is making love?

81
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,679
我呢？

81
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,679
Do I?

82
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,652
我必须告诉你一些事情。

82
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,652
I have to tell you something.

83
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,088
重要的事情。

83
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,088
Something important.

84
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,857
-告诉我，这是什么？

84
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,857
-Tell me, what is it?
-(SHUSHES)

85
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:05,959
今晚。

85
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:05,959
Tonight.

86
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,827
好。

86
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,827
Okay.

87
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,798
-去。-好。

87
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,798
-Go.
-Okay.

88
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,107
你喜欢哪一个？这个？

88
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,107
DRUSILLA: Which one
would you like? This one?

89
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,542
这个。

89
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,542
This one.

91
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,906
这是怎么回事，奥拉？

91
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,906
What's going on, Aura?

92
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,749
现在告诉我。

92
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,749
Now tell me.

96
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,199
我在那里。当那个人试图杀死你时，我就在那里。

96
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,199
I was there. I was there
when that man tried to kill you.

97
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,934
我知道有些不对劲。

97
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,934
And I knew something was wrong.

98
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,069
我就知道。我应该转过身来。

98
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,069
I knew it. And I should have
turned around.

99
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,170
我应该帮你的。

99
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,170
I should have helped you.

104
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,319
 啊！埃利亚！欢迎回来。

104
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,319
ANDRIA: Ah! Elia! Welcome back.

105
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,620
你准备好了吗？

105
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,620
You ready to go?

106
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,055
Ferox 今天早上吃得好吗？

106
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,055
Did Ferox eat well this morning?

107
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,156
芹菜换血？

107
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,156
Celery for the blood?

108
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,357
我们在Baetica喂了它们。

108
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,357
We fed them back in Baetica.

109
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,327
现在我们在这里更好地喂养它们。

109
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,327
And now we feed them
even better here.

110
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,329
小兄弟，你不会迟到的。

110
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,329
It's not like you to be late,
little brother.

111
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,296
我睡过头了。

111
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,296
I overslept.

112
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,967
-在谁的床上？-他昨晚不在家？

112
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,967
-In whose bed?
-He wasn't home last night?

113
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,903
-今天早上也没有。-可以吗，

113
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,903
-Nor this morning.
-Can it be,

114
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,706
他发现的不仅仅是马，还有更多的生命？

114
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,706
he has discovered
more to life than horses?

116
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,379
来，让我们看看你是否已经成为一个男人。

116
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,379
Come, let's see
if you have become a man.

117
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,948
-西班牙人。-没什么可说的。

117
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,948
-A Spaniard.
-There is nothing to tell.

118
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,719
然而，你的束腰外衣走错了路。

118
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,719
Yet, your tunic is on
the wrong way.

119
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,287
-加油。

119
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,287
-Come on.
-(FONSOA CHUCKLES)

120
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,191
你认为我们的小爱情鸟独自过夜还是......

120
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,191
Do you think our little lovebird
spent the night alone or...

121
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,060
也许在一个舒适的巢穴里？嗯？

121
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,060
In a cozy nest, maybe? Hmm?

122
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,063
我看得出来，你不需要我的帮助。

122
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,063
I can see you are not
in need of my help.

123
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,032
-所以。。。-埃利亚。埃利亚。

123
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,032
-So...
-Elia. Elia.

124
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,971
我们为您感到高兴。

124
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,971
We are happy for you.

125
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,142
也许有一天我们能见到她。

125
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,142
Perhaps we can meet her one day.

126
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,749
我绝不会让她遭受这样的折磨。

126
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,749
(LAUGHS) Never would I
commit her to such an ordeal.

127
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,689
安德里亚，马匹准备好了。

127
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,689
Andria, the horses are ready.

128
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,729
安德里亚：今晚喝酒庆祝。

128
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,729
ANDRIA: Drinks tonight
to celebrate.

129
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,672
只是想说这都是一个可怕的错误。

129
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,672
Just meant to say
that this was all
a terrible mistake.

130
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,041
好吧，我可以向你保证没有人会听说它。

130
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,041
Well, I can assure you
no one will hear of it.

131
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,245
祝你好运。

131
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,245
Good luck out there.

135
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,305
今天是个好日子，不是吗？

135
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,305
Today's a good day, is it not?

136
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,940
游戏可能会让人有这种感觉。

136
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,940
The games
may make one feel such.

137
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,843
确实如此。越来越，甚至对我来说也是如此。

137
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,843
They do.
Increasingly, even for me.

138
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,046
还有更多的东西。

138
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,046
There's something more.

139
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,214
我，提图斯，

139
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,214
I, Titus,

140
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,151
凯撒·维斯帕西亚努斯，

140
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,151
Caesar Vespasianus,

141
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,787
给你今天的游戏

141
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,787
give you this day's games

142
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,288
关于建造公民浴场！

142
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,288
on building civic baths!

143
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,759
已经建设了两个月。

143
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,759
Already two months
under construction.

144
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:03,096
我宣布，我正在给我们心爱的罗马......

144
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:03,096
And I announce that I am
giving our beloved Rome...

145
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,367
继承人！

145
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,367
an heir!

147
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,109
他学得比我预期的要快。

147
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,109
He learns more quickly
than I expected.

149
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,384
嘿。

149
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,384
Hey.

150
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,388
要是我爸爸妈妈在这里看到就好了。

150
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,388
If only my mother and father
were here to see this.

151
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,990
整个罗马都在我的脚下。

151
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,990
All of Rome at my feet.

152
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,926
除非你赢了，否则不要叫。

152
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,926
Don't crow unless you win.

153
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,230
 战车！

153
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,230
PASSUS: Chariots!

154
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,266
准备！

154
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,266
Ready!

157
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,396
耶！

157
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,396
Yah!

158
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,932
安德里亚的马在飞翔。

158
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,932
Andria's horses are flying.

160
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,110
给我赢点钱！

160
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,110
Win me some money! (LAUGHS)

162
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,260
谢天谢地，安德里亚领先于那个人。

162
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,260
Thank the Gods
Andria was ahead of that one.

163
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,996
方索阿，我需要你的帮助。

163
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,996
Fonsoa, I need your help.

164
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,964
来。

164
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,964
Coming.

165
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,172

天蝎座，你在做什么？

170
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,208
Scorpus, what are you doing?

171
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,143
呀！耶！

Come on. Come on.

I would like to have met her.

184
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,509
你会的。

184
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,509
And you will.

185
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,980

Look after each other.

187
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,091
答应我。

187
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,091
Promise me.

188
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,430
我会告诉我们的母亲......

188
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,430
I will tell our mother...

189

我们伟大的冒险。

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,534

他选择了自己的路线。

You pulled to the left.

200
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:50,784
告诉我你看到了什么。

200
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:50,784
Tell me what you saw.

201
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,653
他把安德里亚推到了残骸上。他把他关了进去。

201
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,653
He pushed Andria to the wreck.
He boxed him in.

202
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,688
够了。

202
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,688
TENAX: Enough of this.

203
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,790
再碰一下天蝎座，我就会得到你的头。

203
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,790
Touch Scorpus again,
and I will have your head.

204
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,192
我会因为杀死我的兄弟而得到你的。

204
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,192
And I will have yours
for killing my brother.

205
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,065
安德里亚死了。

205
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,065
Andria is dead.

206
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,133
这是个意外。

206
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,133
It was an accident.

207
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,336
结束了。

207
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,336
It's over.

208
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,344
我表示哀悼。

208
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,344
I offer my condolences.

209
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,047
多么悲惨的事故。

209
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,047
What a tragic accident.

210
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,084
-不。你撒谎！-我们的游戏很危险。

210
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,084
-No. You lie!
-Ours is a dangerous game.

211
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,452
你哥哥知道这一点。

211
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,452
Your brother knew that.

212
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,389
看看今天氙气发生了什么。

212
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,389
Look at what happened
to Xenon today.

213
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,661
他是对的，Elia。

213
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,661
He's right, Elia.

214
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,233
你不相信我。

214
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,233
You don't believe me.

215
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,204
我只是没有看到你说你看到了什么。

215
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,204
I just didn't see
what you say you saw.

216
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:47,640
他强迫安德里亚进入沉船，他把他装进了海里！

216
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:47,640
He forced Andria
into the shipwreck
He boxed him in!

217
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,242
-不。-你不能确定。

217
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,242
-No.
-You cannot be sure.

218
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,353
我不会再和你有任何关系了

218
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,353
I will have nothing more
to do with you

219
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,189
或者这个黄金派系。

219
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,189
or this Gold faction.

220
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,334
我有更多的马厩。

220
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,334
I have plenty more stablehands.

221
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,350
埃利亚。

221
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,350
Elia.

222
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,420
那不是天蝎座。那是一场沉船。

222
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,420
It wasn't Scorpus.
It was a shipwreck.

223
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,355
它发生了。

223
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,355
It happens.

224
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,424
你和他一样坏。

224
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,424
You are just as bad as he is.

225
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:53,173
你通常是一个比这更好的骗子。

225
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:53,173
You are usually
a better liar than that.

226
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,608
正如斯科普斯所说，

226
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,608
As Scorpus said,

227
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:59,446
还有其他的马厩，但只有一个天蝎座。

227
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:59,446
there are other stablehands,
but there's only one Scorpus.

229
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,250
我真傻。

229
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,250
Foolish of me.

230
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,588
我以为我在你身上看到了一丝体面。

230
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,588
I thought I had seen
a glimmer of decency in you.

231
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,540
而你呢，兄弟？你站在谁一边？

231
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,540
And you, brother?
On whose side are you on?

232
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,181
 愿风带你去极乐世界，

232
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,181
GAVROS: May the winds
take you to Elysium,

233
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,483
众神会在哪里，

233
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,483
where the Gods will it,

234
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,518
我们会再见面的。

234
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,518
we'll meet again.

235
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:08,682
我从来没有时间或金钱为别人流下很多眼泪。

235
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:08,682
I never had the time or money
to shed many tears for others.

236
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,653
这就是你为残忍辩护的方式吗？

236
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,653
Is that how you justify cruelty?

237
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,790
我就是这样解释的。

237
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,790
That's how I explain it.

238
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,261
你可以对别人撒谎，

238
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,261
You can lie to others,

239
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,563
但是对自己撒谎是危险的。

239
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,563
but it's dangerous
to lie to yourself.

240
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,534
你不再是孩子了。

240
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,534
You are no longer a child.

241
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,570
你完全可以负担得起同情心的奢侈。

241
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,570
You can more than afford
the luxury of compassion.

242
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,874
旧习惯很难改变。

242
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,874
Old habits die hard.

243
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,814
这是道歉吗？

243
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,814
Is that an apology?

244
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,383
也许是这样。

244
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,383
Perhaps it is.

245
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,858
我不太关心你，想要你的道歉。

245
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,858
I don't care enough about you
to want your apology.

246
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,495
那些是需要它的人。

246
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,495
Those are the ones who need it.

247
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,933
我以为我们的安排是为了方便

247
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,933
I thought ours
was an arrangement
of convenience

248
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,735
让你帮助你的孩子。

248
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,735
to allow you
to help your children.

249
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,740
我不知道你会试图让我成为一个体面的人。

249
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,740
I didn't know you would try
to make me a decent man.

250
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,745
我不太在乎你的体面。

250
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,745
I don't care enough
about your decency.

251
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,348
或者缺乏它。

251
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,348
Or lack of it.

253
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,835
你小时候，我曾经在贝蒂斯河边追你。

253
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,835
I used to chase you
by the river Baetis
when you were young.

254
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:36,770
现在我又这样做了？

254
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:36,770
Now I do so again?

255
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,972
我们不再玩儿童游戏了。

255
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,972
We're no longer playing
children's games.

256
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,709
安德里亚最不希望看到的就是我们分裂了。

256
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,709
The last thing Andria
would have wanted
is that we are divided.

257
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,480
所以跟我来。

257
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,480
So come with me.

258
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,386
埃利亚！

258
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,386
Elia!

259
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,255
Elia，等等！

259
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,255
Elia, wait!

260
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,024
如果我和你一起走开，那么萨莱娜和那个男孩呢？

260
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,024
If I were to walk away with you,
what then of Salena and the boy?

261
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:00,427
这来自一个从未走过妓院的男人

261
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:00,427
This coming from the man
who has never walked past
a brothel

262
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,328
-口袋里有几枚硬币。-那是以前。

262
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,328
-with a few coins in his pocket.
-That was before.

263
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,930
-这就是现在。

263
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,930
-And this is now.
-(GRUNTS)

264
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,668
我不能背弃她。

264
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,668
I can't turn my back on her.

265
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,941
继续。还有什么？

265
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,941
Go on. What else?

266
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,744
Scorpus 和 Tenax 为我提供了黄金派系的第二位车手。

266
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:17,744
Scorpus and Tenax
offered me second driver
with the Gold Faction.

267
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,015
这个城市以这种方式扭曲了你

267
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,015
This city has twisted you
in such a way

268
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,718
你会和那些杀死我们兄弟的人一起开车。

268
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,718
that you would drive
with the men
who has killed our brother.

269
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:25,752
只有你一个人说。

269
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:25,752
Says you alone.

270
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,856
然后天蝎座从我身边带走了两个兄弟。

270
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,856
Then Scorpus has taken
two brothers from me.

272
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:39,966
埃利亚。

272
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:39,966
FONSOA: Elia.

274
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,597
所以

274
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:10,597
So,

275
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,566
他拒绝进食，也不想再打架了。

275
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,566
he refuses to eat
and he doesn't want to
fight anymore.

276
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,969
阿迪克斯： 他不想成为我们的傀儡。

276
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,969
ATTICUS: He doesn't want
to be our puppet.

277
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,037
现在多少周了？

277
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,037
How many weeks now?

278
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,772
快五点了，我的主。

278
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,772
Almost five, My Lord.

279
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:23,510
距离弗拉维安圆形剧场开放只有两周的时间。

279
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:23,510
And we only have
two weeks until
the Flavian Amphitheatre opens.

280
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,112
爱马 仕。

280
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,112
Hermes.

281
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,822
我们为您准备了一些美味佳肴。

281
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,822
We've prepared
some delicacies for you.

282
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,058
无花果。

282
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,058
Figs.

283
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:39,926
西班牙橄榄。

283
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:39,926
Spanish olives.

284
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,595
牡蛎。

284
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,595
Oysters.

285
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:45,532
在我的圆形剧场进行揭幕战时，你需要你的力量。

285
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:45,532
You'll need your strength
for the opening fight
at my amphitheater.

286
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:49,035
你应该感谢弗拉维乌斯·多米提亚努斯的恩惠。

286
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:49,035
You should thank
Flavius Domitianus
for his favor.

288
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,086
我们应该再试一次吗？

288
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,086
Should we try that again?

289
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:14,928
吃！你会战斗。

289
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:14,928
Eat! And you will fight.

291
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:27,640
试试那个。

291
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:27,640
Try with that one.

292
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,776
他们是朋友。

292
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,776
They're friends.

293
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,712
和他争吵的那个。

293
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,712
The one he spars with.

294
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:35,849
所以

294
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:35,849
So,

295
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,687
我们应该把箭射穿这个北方野蛮人的脖子吗？

295
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,687
should we put an arrow
through the neck
of this northern barbarian?

296
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:47,894
我感谢你的礼物。

296
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:47,894
I thank you for your gift.

297
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,198
弗拉维乌斯·多米提亚努斯。

297
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,198
Flavius Domitianus.

298
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:06,212
忠诚，无知者的愚蠢特质。你这条狗。

298
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:06,212
Loyalty, the dumb trait
of the ignorant. You dog.

299
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,885
好吧，现在我有最美味的

299
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,885
Well, now I have
the most delicious

300
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:15,221
和杀死那个的有趣方式。

300
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:15,221
and entertaining way
to kill that one.

302
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,132
特纳克斯：图密善喜欢表演。

302
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,132
TENAX: Domitian likes a show.

303
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:30,270
不是每天都有，我们要派遣参议员，甚至......

303
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:30,270
It's not every day, we get
to dispatch senators, even...

304
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,639
像这样奸诈的狗屎，不。

304
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,639
treacherous shits
like these, no.

305
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:37,243
他会想要一些特别的东西，一些戏剧性的东西。

305
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:37,243
He'll want something special,
something theatrical.

306
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:41,147
也许如果 Aedile Ludi 本人在这里，我们可以取悦他。

306
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:41,147
Perhaps if the Aedile Ludi
himself were here,
we could please him.

307
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:44,684
你可能是游戏的新主人，Tuccian，

307
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:44,684
You may be the new master
of the games, Tuccian,

308
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:48,054
但图密善让我成为 Aedile Ludi 的立法者。

308
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:48,054
but Domitian has made me
legislator of the Aedile Ludi.

309
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:52,125
不要质疑他的权威，也不要质疑我的权威。

309
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:52,125
Do not question his authority,
or mine.

310
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,829
答案是肯定的。原谅我。

310
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,829
Of course. Forgive me.

311
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,834
我理解你的保留意见。

311
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,834
I understand your reservations.

312
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:03,703
但相信我，

312
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:03,703
But trust me,

313
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:05,638
我在那些臭气熏天的摊位上长大。

313
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:05,638
I grew up in those
stinking stands.

314
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,907
我知道暴徒想看什么。

314
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,907
I know what the mob
wants to see.

315
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,909
我们需要招待他们。

315
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,909
We need to entertain them.

316
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,145
为了激发他们，为了......

316
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,145
To excite them, to...

317
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:14,214
让他们兴奋不已。

317
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:14,214
thrill them.

318
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:19,219
记住，够了就好了。

318
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:19,219
Remember, enough is good.

319
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:23,056
越多越好。

319
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:23,056
More is better.

320
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:25,892
太多了。。。

320
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:25,892
Too much...

321
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:29,095
是完美的。

321
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:29,095
is perfect.

322
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,870
淹没圆形剧场有多难？

322
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,870
How hard would it be
to flood the amphitheater?

323
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,085
这太慷慨了。

323
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,085
This is too generous.

324
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:53,720
为你的儿子接受它。

324
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:53,720
Accept it for your son.

325
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,690
如果不是为了你自己。

325
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,690
If not for yourself.

326
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,858
我还能用我所有的收入做什么？

326
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,858
What else am I going to do
with all my earnings?

327
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,028
我只能喝这么多酒。

327
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,028
I can only drink so much wine.

328
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:09,769
在一个条件下。

328
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:09,769
On one condition.

329
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:12,939
这是贷款，不是礼物。

329
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:12,939
This is a loan, not a gift.

330
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,141
当我重新获得我的股份时，我会还给你。

330
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,141
I will pay you back
when I regain my shares.

331
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,011
如果我重新获得我的股份。

331
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,011
If I regain my shares.

332
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:19,746
你会的。

332
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:19,746
You will.

333
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:22,082
事情会变得更好。

333
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:22,082
Things will get better.

335
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,290
方索阿，这是什么？

335
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,290
Fonsoa, what is it?

336
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:35,295
是我哥哥。

336
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:35,295
It's my brother.

337
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,832
我想念他。

337
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,832
I miss him.

338
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,250
如果Fonsoa是对的呢？

338
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,250
ELIA: What if Fonsoa is right?

339
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,254
如果这只是一个意外呢？

339
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,254
What if it was just an accident?

340
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:05,792
我，呃......

340
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:05,792
I, uh...

341
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,294
我没有好好看它。

341
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,294
I didn't have a good view of it.

342
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:12,132
你似乎是唯一一个这样做的人。

342
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:12,132
You seem to be
the only one who did.

343
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,138
氙！

343
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,138
Xenon!

344
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:20,907
他就在那里。他一定看到了什么。

344
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:20,907
He was right there.
He must have seen something.

347
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:00,246
天蝎座。

347
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:00,246
XENON: Scorpus.

348
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,116
我很抱歉，我的朋友。

348
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,116
I am so sorry, my friend.

349
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,418
你是？

349
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,418
Are you?

350
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:09,456
或者你只是来看看它是否真的是真的？

350
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:09,456
Or did you just come to see
if it's actually true?

351
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,359
那个氙气已经完成了。

351
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,359
That Xenon is finished.

352
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,893
废话。

352
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,893
Nonsense.

353
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:15,462
你和我很快就会再次比赛。

353
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:15,462
You and I will race again soon.

354
00:28:16,496 --> 00:28:19,966
我，呃，带了礼物。

354
00:28:16,496 --> 00:28:19,966
I've, uh, brought gifts.

355
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:24,371
因此，Atargatis可以减轻您的疼痛并加快您的康复速度。

355
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:24,371
So Atargatis can ease
your pain and speed up
your recovery.

356
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,350
这是怎麽？

356
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,350
What's this?

357
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,319
一份礼物。

357
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,319
A gift.

358
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,355
支付医生费用。

358
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,355
To pay for physicians.

359
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,959
任何你需要或想要的东西。

359
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,959
Anything you need or desire.

360
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,897
谢谢你，但我有足够的钱来支付我的医生费用。

360
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,897
Thank you,
but I have enough money
to pay for my physicians.

361
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,168
当然，我只是想减轻你的负担。

361
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,168
Of course, I seek only
to lighten your burden.

362
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,107
你认为几枚硬币能买到我的沉默吗？

362
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,107
Do you think a few coins
will buy my silence?

363
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:05,812
我不明白你。

363
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:05,812
I don't understand you.

364
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,113
是的，你有。

364
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,113
Yes, you do.

365
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,284
你强迫年轻的西班牙人进入脊柱。

365
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,284
You forced the young Spaniard
into the spina.

366
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,353
我看到了。

366
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,353
I saw it.

367
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,423
好吧，你错了。

367
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,423
Well, you are mistaken.

368
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:20,093
你受伤了。你的头脑不清楚。

368
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:20,093
You were injured.
Your mind was not clear.

369
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,128
不，天蝎座。

369
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,128
No, Scorpus.

370
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,130
我看到了我所看到的。

370
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,130
I saw what I saw.

371
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:27,400
你杀了那个男孩。

371
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:27,400
You killed that boy.

372
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,537
我坚持要你向派系所有者坦白。

372
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,537
And I insist that you confess
to the faction owners.

373
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,376
我不能那样做。

373
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,376
I cannot do that.

374
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:39,279
我会失去一切。我再也不会参加比赛了。

374
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:39,279
I would lose everything.
I would never race again.

375
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,481
请。

375
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,481
Please.

376
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:44,551
氙气，在那天晚上之后，

376
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:44,551
Xenon, after that evening,

377
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,189
我以为你和我现在是朋友了。

377
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,189
I thought you and I
were now friends.

378
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:52,025
带上你的友谊，

378
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:52,025
Take your friendship,

379
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:54,561
和你的礼物，

379
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:54,561
and your gift,

380
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,429
然后把它推到你的屁股上。

380
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,429
and shove it up your ass.

381
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,531
现在出去！

381
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,531
Now get out!

382
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:05,605
如果你不告诉他们，我会的。

382
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:05,605
XENON: (COUGHS)
If you don't tell them, I will.

386
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,345
氙。

386
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,345
Xenon.

387
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,380
氙。

387
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,380
Xenon.

388
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:24,150
医生在哪里？

388
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:24,150
Where is the physician?

389
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:27,387
他在哪？快点来。

389
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:27,387
Where is he? Come quickly.

390
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:29,356
他没有呼吸。

390
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:29,356
He's not breathing.

391
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,971
斯科普斯：这太可怕了。

391
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,971
SCORPUS: It's terrible thing.

392
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,206
氙

392
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,206
Xenon,

393
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,308
死了。

393
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,308
is dead.

394
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,644
这对我们所有人来说都是损失。

394
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,644
A loss for all of us.

396
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:09,562
你可能听说过。

396
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:09,562
GAVROS: You may have heard.

397
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,664
我们不再为黄金派系工作。

397
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,664
We no longer work
for the Gold Faction.

398
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:14,000
所以你找工作？

398
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:14,000
FIMBRIA: So you seek work?

399
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:15,201
是的。

399
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:15,201
GAVROS: Yes.

400
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:20,340
在罗马，没有人比我们更了解和驯服马匹。

400
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:20,340
No one in Rome knows
and tames horses
better than we do.

401
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:23,576
可悲的是，我们有一整套马厩和马夫。

401
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:23,576
Sadly, we have a full complement
of stablehands and grooms.

402
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,611
你误会我们了。

402
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,611
You misunderstand us.

403
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,013
我想参加比赛。

403
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,013
I wish to race.

404
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,715
-比赛？-是的。

404
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,715
-(SCOFFS) To race?
-Yes.

405
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,251
你是车夫吗？

405
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,251
Are you a charioteer?

406
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,219
我从来没见过你开车。

406
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,219
I've never seen you drive.

407
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,554
这是怎麽？

407
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,554
What is this?

408
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:39,125
这些绅士们是来做派系生意的。

408
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:39,125
These gentlemen
are here on faction business.

409
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,564
显然，任何与蓝色派系有关的事情都是我所关心的。

409
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,564
Clearly, and anything
that concerns the Blue Faction
is my concern.

410
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:46,166
这是加夫罗斯。

410
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:46,166
This is Gavros.

411
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:49,336
是的，我知道他是谁。

411
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:49,336
Yes, I know who he is.

412
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:53,273
这是埃利亚，死去的黄金司机的兄弟。

412
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:53,273
And this is Elia,
brother of the Gold driver
who died.

413
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,775
他还有另一个兄弟。仍在为金牌而战。

413
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,775
He has another brother.
Still driving for the Gold.

414
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,645
的确，罗穆卢斯和雷穆斯。

414
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,645
Indeed, Romulus and Remus.

415
00:32:58,678 --> 00:33:01,614
他希望开车，但他没有受过训练，也没有经过验证。

415
00:32:58,678 --> 00:33:01,614
He hopes to drive,
but he's untrained and unproven.

416
00:33:06,786 --> 00:33:08,221
走近一点。

416
00:33:06,786 --> 00:33:08,221
Come closer.

417
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,695
近。

417
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,695
Closer.

418
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:26,373
你哥哥为金牌开车。

418
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:26,373
Your brother drives
for the Gold.

419
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:29,509
你为什么要为蓝军而战？

419
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:29,509
Why would you race for the Blue?

420
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:37,684
因为天蝎座为黄金而开车。

420
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:37,684
Because Scorpus
drives for the Gold.

421
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,587
我会在赛道上面对他，

421
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,587
I will face him on the track,

422
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:42,489
我要打败他。

422
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:42,489
and I will defeat him.

423
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:52,866
你说他未经证实？

423
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:52,866
You said he's unproven?

424
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,267
是的。

424
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,267
FIMBRIA: Yes.

425
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,343
那么你必须证明自己。

425
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,343
Then you must prove yourself.

427
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:13,420
去我们的马厩装备。我今晚会在那里。

427
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:13,420
Go to our stables and rig up.
I'll be there this evening.

428
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,428
有数百名年轻人希望为蓝军开车。

428
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,428
FIMBRIA: There are hundreds
of young men wishing
to drive for the Blue.

429
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:22,662
为什么要给他机会？

429
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:22,662
Why give him a chance?

430
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:25,432
让他与众不同的一件事。

430
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:25,432
The one thing
that sets him apart.

431
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:30,537
他的仇恨。

431
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:30,537
His hatred.

432
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:36,109
你可以告诉我你想开车。

432
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:36,109
You could have told me
you wanted to drive.

433
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:38,311
有这么惊喜吗？

433
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:38,311
Was it such a surprise?

434
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,512
没有。

434
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,512
Not really.

435
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,383
但是，你还是应该告诉我的。

435
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,383
But still,
you should have told me.

436
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:46,653
马厩见。

436
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:46,653
See you at the stables.

437
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:04,804
我一直想见你。

437
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:04,804
I've been wanting to see you.

438
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:10,677
我听说过你哥哥。

438
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:10,677
I heard about your brother.

439
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:14,514
我的心在流血。

439
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:14,514
My heart bleeds.

440
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,150
任何人都无能为力。

440
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,150
There's nothing anyone can do.

441
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:26,659
我必须告诉你一些事情。

441
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:26,659
I have to tell you something.

442
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:28,695
我也需要告诉你一些事情。

442
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:28,695
And I need to tell you
something, too.

443
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:32,832
我要回家，去西班牙，去贝蒂卡。

443
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:32,832
I'm going back home,
to Spain, to Baetica.

444
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:36,770
-什么？-我必须先做点什么。

444
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:36,770
-What?
-I must do something first.

445
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:40,206
但只要我能，我就要离开了。

445
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:40,206
But as soon as I can,
I'm leaving.

446
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:47,714
对不起。

446
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:47,714
I'm sorry.

447
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,438
我的皇帝。

447
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,438
My Emperor.

448
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,573
波尔图告诉我，你有一个指控要提出。

448
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,573
Porto tells me
you have an accusation to make.

449
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:16,343
我只是有信息要传授，提图斯勋爵。

449
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:16,343
I merely have information
to impart, Lord Titus.

450
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:19,879
不要玩文字游戏。将其视为关于活动的现场报告。

450
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:19,879
Don't play with words.
Treat this like a field report
on campaign.

451
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:25,485
我相信你的兄弟图密善要为粮食延误负责。

451
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:25,485
I believe your brother Domitian
is responsible for
the grain delays.

452
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,455
还有食物骚乱。

452
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,455
And food riots.

453
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:29,823
提图斯：你有证据吗？

453
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:29,823
TITUS: Do you have proof?

454
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:31,257
其中一艘运粮船上的领航员，

454
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:31,257
A navigator
on one of the grain ships,

455
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:36,730
它在西西里岛海岸沉没，但他获救，然后被捕。

455
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:36,730
it sank off the coast of Sicily,
but he was rescued
and then arrested.

456
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:38,798
在我们发言时，证人正被押送到这里。

456
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:38,798
The witness is being
escorted here as we speak.

457
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:40,734
告诉我这些对你有什么好处？

457
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:40,734
And how does
telling me this benefit you?

458
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:43,737
我只想服侍你，服侍罗马。

458
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:43,737
I seek only to serve you
and serve Rome.

459
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,771
嗯。

459
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,771
Hmm.

460
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:49,676
我有很多客户，在参议院公开和秘密，

460
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:49,676
I have many clients,
open and secret
in the Senate,

461
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,911
足以影响任何投票。

461
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,911
enough to sway any vote.

462
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,483
我向你们提供全面和持续的支持

462
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,483
I offer you full
and sustained support

463
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:58,518
用于您的建筑项目。

463
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:58,518
for your construction projects.

464
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:01,021
作为回报，你想要吗？

464
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:01,021
And in return you want?

465
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:04,324
弗拉维安圆形剧场的财务参与。

465
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:04,324
Financial participation
in the Flavian Amphitheater.

466
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:05,925
这是一个奇怪的愿望。

466
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:05,925
(CHUCKLES)
That's a strange desire.

467
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,661
这没有利润。只有成本。

467
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:08,661
There's no profit in that.
Only costs.

468
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:11,898
目前。

468
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:11,898
For now.

469
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,840
做。

469
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,840
Done.

470
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:24,411
波尔图，把你最信任的人派到奥斯蒂亚，等待这个领航员。

470
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:24,411
Porto, post your
most trusted man in Ostia
to wait for this navigator.

471
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:26,479
他一到，就把他带到我面前。

471
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:26,479
Bring him before me
as soon as he arrives.

472
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:28,915
凯撒，你有我的感谢和忠诚。

472
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:28,915
You have my thanks,
and my loyalty, Caesar.

473
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:32,852
我只对后者感兴趣。你可以走了。

473
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:32,852
I'm only interested
in the latter. You may go.

474
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:44,631
我不得不说，兄弟，我看到你的目标更坚定了。

474
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:44,631
I have to say, brother,
I've seen you with steadier aim.

475
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:47,667
没有什么能让你感到不安。

475
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:47,667
Nothing used to unnerve you.

476
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:49,969
甚至连父亲的咳嗽都没有。

476
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:49,969
Not even Father's cough.

477
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:52,839
离开我们。

477
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:52,839
DOMITIAN: Leave us.

478
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,083
希腊人，他们说

478
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,083
Greeks, they say that

479
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:07,387
当宽恕之前有忏悔时，宽恕更容易给予。

479
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:07,387
forgiveness is easier to grant
when it's preceded
by confession.

480
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:09,823
你希望我坦白什么？

480
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:09,823
What do you wish me to confess?

481
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:12,926
莱托参议员告诉我

481
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:12,926
I'm told by Senator Leto

482
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:16,596
他的船务代理已经找到了证据

482
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:16,596
that his shipping agents
have found proof

483
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:17,997
你耽误了谷物。

483
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:17,997
that you delayed the grain.

484
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:20,867
但是兄弟，我不能承认我没有做过的事情。

484
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:20,867
But brother, I cannot confess
to something I didn't do.

485
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,970
显然，有一个证人

485
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,970
Apparently, there was a witness

486
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:27,674
在前往罗马的途中，他将证实一切。

486
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:27,674
en route to Rome
who will corroborate everything.

487
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:30,577
显然，涵盖了广泛的结果，

487
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:30,577
Apparently, covers
a wide range of outcomes,

488
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,715
而莱托是一个自私自利、野心勃勃的贵族，

488
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,715
and Leto is a self-serving,
ambitious patrician,

489
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:38,852
谁从一开始就憎恨我们的优越地位。

489
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:38,852
who's resented our ascendancy
from the start.

490
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:40,053
我知道这两件事。

490
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:40,053
I know both of these things.

491
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:43,423
然而，你却要我承认一些明显的不当行为。

491
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:43,423
And yet you asked me to confess
to some apparent misdeed.

492
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,624
差一点。

492
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,624
Not quite.

493
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:48,795
我正在向你学习如何玩这个游戏。

493
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:48,795
I'm learning how to play
this game from you.

494
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:51,498
所以我告诉你一个关于你的指责，

494
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:51,498
So I'm telling you
an accusation about you,

495
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:53,767
我在观察你的反应。

495
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:53,767
and I'm watching
how you respond.

496
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,734
你看到了什么？

496
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,734
And what do you see?

497
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:57,837
嗯，这是我仍在学习的部分。

497
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:57,837
Well, that's the part
I'm still learning.

498
00:38:57,871 --> 00:39:02,075
我看到一个有点奇怪但忠诚的兄弟。

498
00:38:57,871 --> 00:39:02,075
I see either a somewhat strange,
but loyal brother.

499
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,912
或者是我见过的最好的骗子。

499
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,912
Or the best liar
I have ever seen.

500
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:16,222
多莫斯。

500
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:16,222
Domus.

501
00:39:16,256 --> 00:39:18,425
我想你会对我设计的节目感到满意。

501
00:39:16,256 --> 00:39:18,425
I think you'll be pleased
with the show I've devised.

502
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,526
你辜负了我。

502
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,526
You have failed me.

503
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,896
你要掩盖我的踪迹，以防粮食延误。

503
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,896
You were to cover my tracks
for the grain delays.

504
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:25,832
一位来自运粮船的航海家幸存下来。

504
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:25,832
A navigator,
from a grain ship,
has survived.

505
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:28,168
他被带到罗马为提多作证。

505
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:28,168
He's been brought here to Rome
to testify to Titus.

506
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:31,504
然后我们杀了他。他对你们活着的人说的死话。

506
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:31,504
Then we kill him.
His dead words against
your living ones.

507
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,740
-他在哪？-为时已晚。

507
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,740
-Where is he?
-It's too late for that.

508
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:35,041
他已经作了书面证词。

508
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:35,041
He's already made
a written testimony.

509
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:39,879
剩下的就是让他和我哥哥确认一下。

509
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:39,879
All that's left is for him
to confirm it with my brother.

510
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:44,684
如果杀了他为时已晚，那又如何呢？

510
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:44,684
If it's too late to kill him,
then what?

511
00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:47,687
我们杀了我的兄弟。

511
00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:47,687
We kill my brother.

513
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:56,996
这一刻即将到来。要么杀人，要么被杀。

513
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:56,996
The moment is upon us.
Kill, or be killed.

514
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:04,037
好吧，我们可以在禁卫军中买谁？

514
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:04,037
All right, who among
the Praetorians can we buy?

515
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:08,108
爱马 仕。

515
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:08,108
Hermes.

518
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,111
图密善。

518
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,111
Domitian.

519
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:53,019
来吧，加入我们。

519
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:53,019
Come, join us.

520
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:02,962
抓住他。

520
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:02,962
Take him.

521
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,132
什么？不 不。

521
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,132
What? No, no.

522
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:10,770
图密善，拜托，拜托。我不明白。

522
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:10,770
Domitian, please, please.
I don't understand.

523
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:18,078
没有我的许可。

523
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:18,078
Not without my permission.

524
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:20,780
我很抱歉。

524
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:20,780
I'm so sorry.

525
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:23,983
对不起。对不起。不！

525
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:23,983
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No!

526
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:25,552
请！

526
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:25,552
Please!

527
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:27,253
不，拜托！

527
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:27,253
No, please!

534
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,979
这里。这是他付给我的一切。

534
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,979
IRIS: Here. This is
everything he paid me.

535
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:30,884
皮条客：坐下。

535
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:30,884
PIMP: Sit down.

536
00:42:35,655 --> 00:42:37,023
虹膜。跟我回家吧。

536
00:42:35,655 --> 00:42:37,023
Iris. Come home with me.

537
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:43,930
你跟我来。

537
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:43,930
You're coming with me.

538
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:46,366
你去哪儿？

538
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:46,366
Where are you going?

539
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,401
她是我的财产，你这个婊子。

539
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,401
She's my property, you bitch.

544
00:42:58,278 --> 00:43:00,814
如果你再靠近她，

544
00:42:58,278 --> 00:43:00,814
If you go near her again,

545
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:03,883
我会慢慢杀了你。婊 子！

545
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:03,883
I will kill you slowly. Bitch!

546
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:11,057
鸢尾花，过来。

546
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:11,057
Iris, come.

549
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,118
-困扰？-你也是？

549
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,118
-Troubled?
-You as well?

550
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,789
我的女儿，奥拉。

550
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,789
My daughter, Aura.

551
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,259
她不再是我的了。

551
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,259
She is no longer mine.

552
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:51,131
我把她丢到了罗马。

552
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:51,131
I lost her to Rome.

553
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,991
你告诉我...

553
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,991
You told me...

554
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:21,327
对别人撒谎是可以的，但对自己撒谎是危险的。

554
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:21,327
that it's fine to lie to others,
but dangerous to lie
to yourself.

555
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:24,030
我把这句话记在心里。

555
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:24,030
I took that to heart.

556
00:44:25,031 --> 00:44:27,200
你正在学习。

556
00:44:25,031 --> 00:44:27,200
You're learning.

557
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:30,136
我可能不是你认为的那个。

557
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:30,136
I might not be quite the scum
you think I am.

558
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,310
而且我有可能是贵族血统。

558
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,310
And there is a chance
I am of patrician blood.

560
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,050
你们罗马人太愚蠢了。

560
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,050
You Romans are so foolish.

561
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,052
你认为血液很重要吗？

561
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,052
You think blood matters?

562
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:50,757
在罗马，鲜血就是一切。

562
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:50,757
In Rome, blood is everything.

563
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,893
有了正确的血液，一个人可以做任何事情。

563
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,893
With the right blood,
a man can do anything.

564
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:56,196
整个世界在他面前敞开。

564
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:56,196
The whole world
opens up before him.

565
00:44:56,229 --> 00:44:59,532
你的新朋友，出身高贵的朋友，会忽略恶臭吗？

565
00:44:56,229 --> 00:44:59,532
And will your new,
high-born friends,
ignore the stench

566
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:02,268
你去过哪里，你做了什么？

566
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:02,268
of where you've been
and what you've done?

567
00:45:06,272 --> 00:45:07,807
他们忽略了更糟糕的情况。

567
00:45:06,272 --> 00:45:07,807
They've ignored worse.

568
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:16,783
我不知道你是兴奋还是害怕。

568
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:16,783
I can't tell if you are
excited or frightened.

569
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:20,754
害怕。

569
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:20,754
Frightened.

570
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:29,229
我必须做一些可怕的事情。

570
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:29,229
I have to do something terrible.

571
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:33,033
这曾经给我带来快乐。

571
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:33,033
Which would have once
given me pleasure.

572
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:36,503
但是现在，如果我是一等罗马人，

572
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:36,503
But now, if I'm a Roman
of the first order,

573
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:39,839
这让我很害怕。

573
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:39,839
it terrifies me.

574
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:42,809
然后只想着快乐。

574
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:42,809
Then only think of the pleasure.

575
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:57,390
不。

575
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:57,390
No.

576
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:00,193
不。。。

576
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:00,193
Not...

577
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:03,897
不，什么？还没有？

577
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:03,897
No, what? Not yet?

578
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:06,933
我没这么说。

578
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:06,933
I didn't say that.

579
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:09,269
但你在想。

579
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:09,269
But you were thinking it.

580
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:14,574
也许。

580
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:14,574
Perhaps.

582
00:46:58,351 --> 00:47:00,186
在萨姆尼亚，我有一个表弟。

582
00:46:58,351 --> 00:47:00,186
In Samnia, I have a cousin.

583
00:47:02,122 --> 00:47:04,591
他在地下的骨库工作。

583
00:47:02,122 --> 00:47:04,591
He worked underground
in an ossuary.

584
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:07,594
从死者身上排出液体，

584
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:07,594
Draining fluids from the dead,

585
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:10,230
为地下室做准备。

585
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:10,230
preparing them for the crypts.

586
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:12,866
没有比这更低的了。

586
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:12,866
There is nothing lower.

587
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:15,602
他逃脱了。

587
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:15,602
He escaped that.

588
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:16,903
他自杀了？

588
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:16,903
He took his own life?

589
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:20,373
不，他是自愿入学的

589
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:20,373
No, he enrolled by free will

590
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:22,308
作为 Ludus Magnus 的角斗士。

590
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:22,308
as a gladiator
at the Ludus Magnus.

591
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:24,477
你是说他不是奴隶吗？

591
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:24,477
Do you mean he wasn't a slave?

592
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:25,645
许多人是奴隶。

592
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:25,645
Many are slaves.

593
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:29,015
但有些人是自愿来的。

593
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:29,015
But some come there by choice.

594
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:34,954
选择死在别人的手里。

594
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:34,954
Choosing death
by another's hand.

595
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:37,490
也许不是。

595
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:37,490
Maybe not.

596
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:40,927
三年过去了，他还活着。

596
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:40,927
It's been three years,
and he's still alive.

597
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,364
他有饭吃，有地方睡觉，受到尊重。

597
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,364
He eats,
he has a place to sleep,
and is treated with respect.

598
00:47:45,632 --> 00:47:47,233
这不仅仅是男人。

598
00:47:45,632 --> 00:47:47,233
It's not just men.

599
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:49,969
他们也招募女性作为角斗士。

599
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:49,969
They enlist women
as gladiators as well.

600
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:53,673
-女人？-人群觉得这很有趣。

600
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:53,673
-Women?
-The crowds find it amusing.

601
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:58,611
但有时候，一个女人打得那么好，

601
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:58,611
But sometimes,
a woman fights so well,

602
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:00,513
他们停止大笑。

602
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:00,513
that they stop laughing.

603
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:15,228
哇。

603
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:15,228
Whoa. (SHUSHES AND WHISTLES)

604
00:48:15,261 --> 00:48:18,264
-嘿，简单，简单。

604
00:48:15,261 --> 00:48:18,264
-Hey, easy, easy.
-(HORSE SNORTS)

605
00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:20,200
煽动。

605
00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:20,200
Incitatus.

606
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,202
你饿了吧？

606
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,202
You are hungry, huh? (CHUCKLES)

607
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:23,403
这里。

607
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:23,403
Here.

608
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:26,373
给你，男孩。

608
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:26,373
Here you go, boy.

609
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:30,276
在西班牙的家乡，我的祖父曾经说过，

609
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:30,276
Back home in Spain,
my grandfather used to say,

610
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:35,348
马是猎物，人是掠食者。

610
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:35,348
horses are prey,
and men are predators.

611
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:39,586
为了让一匹马奔跑，我们必须说服他们

611
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:39,586
To get a horse to run,
we must convince them

612
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:41,488
我们不是真正的我们。

612
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:41,488
that we are not
what we truly are.

613
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:46,026
杀手。

613
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:46,026
Killers.

614
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:49,462
首先，你让他们知道你不会伤害他们。

614
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:49,462
First, you let them know
that you are not
going to hurt them.

615
00:48:49,496 --> 00:48:53,033
哇，嘘。但这还不够。

615
00:48:49,496 --> 00:48:53,033
Whoa, shh.
But that is not enough.

616
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:55,969
让一匹马奔跑很容易。

616
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:55,969
To get a horse to run is easy.

617
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,638
为了让他真正飞起来，

617
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,638
To get him to really fly,

618
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:01,675
让他全心全意，

618
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:01,675
for him to give
his heart and soul,

619
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:04,044
汗水和肌肉，

619
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:04,044
and sweat and muscle,

620
00:49:05,378 --> 00:49:06,579
我必须爱他。

620
00:49:05,378 --> 00:49:06,579
I must love him.

621
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:10,350
他必须知道这一点。

621
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:10,350
And he must know it.

622
00:49:11,317 --> 00:49:15,021
如果我以正确的方式告诉他，我有多爱他，

622
00:49:11,317 --> 00:49:15,021
And if I tell him the right way,
how much I love him,

623
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:17,657
他会为我做任何事。

623
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:17,657
he will do anything for me.

624
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,341
你赌得很糟糕。

624
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,341
You made a bad bet.

625
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:36,443
我不知道。

625
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:36,443
I don't know.

626
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:38,745
也许提图斯不会再当皇帝了。

626
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:38,745
Perhaps Titus won't be Emperor
for much longer.

627
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,349
他身上有太多的士兵气质。

627
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,349
There's too much
of the soldier in him.

628
00:49:42,882 --> 00:49:45,051
没有足够的政治家。

628
00:49:42,882 --> 00:49:45,051
Not enough politician.

629
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:46,319
谁将取代他？

629
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:46,319
Who will supplant him?

630
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:48,521
图密善。答案是肯定的。

630
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:48,521
Domitian. Of course.

631
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:51,524
如果发生这种情况，

631
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:51,524
And if that were to happen,

632
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:54,694
所有忠于提多的人，都可能和他一起死。

632
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:54,694
all those loyal to Titus,
would likely die with him.

633
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,366
没有人喜欢松散的结局。

633
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,366
Nobody likes loose ends.

634
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:01,768
罗马曾有过像老人一样死去的战士统治者。

634
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:01,768
Rome has had warrior rulers
who died as old men.

635
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:05,271
也许在战时。

635
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:05,271
In wartime maybe.

636
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:08,608
但这是和平。危险得多。

636
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:08,608
But this is peace.
Far more dangerous.

637
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:11,044
在和平中，你不想要战士。

637
00:50:08,641 --> 00:50:11,044
In peace,
you don't want warriors.

638
00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:13,646
你想要街头霸王。

638
00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:13,646
You want street fighters.

639
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:19,486
一千万塞斯特斯的黄金，两天后，

639
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:19,486
Ten million sesterces in gold,
two days from now,

640
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,388
在这个地方，

640
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,388
here in this place,

641
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:24,157
如果你试图讨价还价，

641
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:24,157
and if you try to bargain,

642
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:29,129
它只是告诉我图密善缺乏成功的资源，我会杀了你。

642
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:29,129
it merely tells me Domitian
lacks the resources to succeed,
and I will kill you.

643
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:31,464
并向提多报告他的叛国行为。

643
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:31,464
And report his treason to Titus.

644
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:34,834
两天。

644
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:34,834
Two days.

645
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:39,673
图密善比你想象的更接近死亡。

645
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:39,673
Domitian is closer to death
than you think.

646
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:42,075
如果他死了，他的朋友也会死。

646
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:42,075
And if he dies,
so will his friends.

647
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,544
没有人喜欢松散的结局。

647
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,544
Nobody likes loose ends.

648
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:49,783
京。

648
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:49,783
Ten million.

649
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:52,619
两天。

649
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:52,619
Two days.

651
00:51:12,472 --> 00:51:14,507
哇，哇，哇。

651
00:51:12,472 --> 00:51:14,507
ELIA: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

652
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,844
简单，简单。

652
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,844
Easy, easy.

654
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,828
耶！

654
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,828
Yah!

656
00:51:46,806 --> 00:51:48,208
安德里亚！

656
00:51:46,806 --> 00:51:48,208
Andria!

657
00:51:51,678 --> 00:51:52,712
耶！

657
00:51:51,678 --> 00:51:52,712
Yah!

659
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:13,900
您知道吗？他速度很快，非常快。

659
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:13,900
Did you know?
He's fast, very fast.
