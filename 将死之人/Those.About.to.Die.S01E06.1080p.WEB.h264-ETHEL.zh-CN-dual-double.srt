1
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,779
以前在那些即将死去的人身上......

1
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,779
Previously on
Those About to Die...

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,484
如果那个伤痕累累的大个子来了，你们中的一个人会跟着他

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,484
If the big, scarred man
comes, one of you follows him

3
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,686
另一个来找我。

3
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,686
and the other one
comes to find me.

4
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,265
你的兄弟姐妹正在为他们的生命而战，

4
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,265
Your brother and sister
are fighting for their lives,

5
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,059
你说得好像这是一次伟大的冒险？

5
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,059
and you talk as if this is
some great adventure?

6
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:27,292
维斯塔尔处女，

6
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:27,292
The Vestal Virgins,

7
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:29,963
罗马永恒之火的守护者。

7
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:29,963
guardians of
Rome's eternal flame.

8
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:31,830
你能帮我吗？

8
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:31,830
Could you help me?

9
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,710
我的母亲会不会为她的女儿流泪，就像你为你的女儿流泪一样。

9
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,710
Would that my mother had had tears
for her daughter, as you do for yours.

10
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:35,601
而对于我们的家庭来说，

10
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:35,601
And for our family,

11
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:38,405
我们会烧毁整个该死的帝国。

11
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:38,405
we'll burn down the
entire fucking empire.

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,606
找掩护。

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,606
Take cover.

13
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,564
关门。

13
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,564
Close the door.

14
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:15,141
拿到粗麻布！迅速！

14
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:15,141
Get the burlap! Quickly!

15
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,112
加夫罗斯。

15
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,112
Gavros.

16
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,664
天蝎座，回来吧。

16
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,664
Scorpus, come back.

17
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,633
你叫什么名字？

17
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,633
What is your name?

18
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:41,734
西娜。

18
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:41,734
Xena.

19
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,307
维苏威火山爆发了。

19
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,307
Vesuvius has erupted.

20
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,075
风吹起了灰烬云

20
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,075
The winds have
carried the ash cloud

21
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:51,378
超过100个联赛，横跨罗马及其他地区的大部分地区。

21
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:51,378
over 100 leagues across
much of Rome and beyond.

22
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,246
庞贝城和赫库兰尼姆仅此而已。

22
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,246
Pompeii and
Herculaneum and no more.

23
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,515
幸存者？

23
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,515
Survivors?

24
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:01,388
十五人，也许是18,000人，前往罗马。

24
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:01,388
Fifteen, perhaps 18,000,
making their way to Rome.

25
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,355
几艘船有时间扬帆，

25
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,355
A few ships had
time to raise sail,

26
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,891
他们带着几百名幸存者抵达奥斯蒂亚。

26
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,891
they're arriving at Ostia
with a few hundred survivors.

27
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,236
我们将派出一批禁卫军

27
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,236
We'll send a cohort
of Praetorians

28
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,828
在亚壁古道上与那些人会面。

28
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,828
to meet those on the Appian Way.

29
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:10,729
食物、医生、衣服。

29
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:10,729
Food, physicians, clothing.

30
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:15,168
还有更多。

30
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:15,168
There's more.

31
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,304
更 糟。

31
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,304
Worse.

32
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,711
维斯塔的火焰已经熄灭了。

32
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,711
The vestal flame has gone out.

33
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,548
来自整个罗马的无声厄运。

33
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,548
A silent doom from all of Rome.

34
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,085
它无人看管......

34
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,085
It was unattended...

35
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,521
它已经被重新点燃，Vestal Matron

35
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,521
It has been reignited
and the Vestal Matron

36
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,223
被鞭打，她的尸体挂在赎罪中。

36
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,223
has been flogged, her
corpse hangs in atonement.

37
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,694
设置营地。收集食物。

37
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,694
Set encampments. Gather food.

38
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:45,432
传出消息，罗马将为有需要的人敞开大门。

38
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:45,432
Send word that Rome will
open her gates for those in need.

39
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:46,531
立即。

39
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:46,531
At once.

40
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,211
怎么了？

40
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,211
What's wrong?

41
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:04,384
那个角斗士，努米底亚人，

41
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:04,384
That gladiator, the Numidian,

42
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,895
当我给他奖金时，

42
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,895
when I was giving
him his prize money,

43
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,621
他正要从我的一名警卫手中抢过一把短剑。

43
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,621
he was moving to grab a
gladius from one of my guards.

44
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,556
他要杀了我。

44
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,556
He was going to kill me.

45
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,294
你能想象吗？

45
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,294
Can you imagine?

46
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,931
像我这样有 auctoritas 和 gravitas 的人，

46
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,931
A man of auctoritas and
gravitas such as myself,

47
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,432
被老鼠杀死了。

47
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,432
killed by a mouse.

48
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,269
踩在他身上。

48
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,269
Step on him.

49
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,070
我认为 Flamma 会做踩踏。

49
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,070
I think Flamma
will do the stepping.

50
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,506
他复仇的时机已经成熟。

50
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,506
He's ripe for revenge.

51
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,110
那将是最有趣的

51
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,110
That would be the
most entertaining

52
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,346
粉碎小生物的方式。

52
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,346
way to crush
the little creature.

53
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,687
嘿！

53
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,687
Hey!

54
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,489
-嘿！-这是怎么回事？

54
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,489
- Hey!
- What's going on?

55
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,758
退后。退后。

55
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,758
Stay back. Stay back.

56
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,158
但是他做了什么？

56
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,158
But what has he done?

57
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,461
他激发了图密善的敌意。

57
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,461
He's excited the
animus of Domitian.

58
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,066
Flamma 将进行二番战，赢得 Kwame

58
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,066
There will be a rematch
for Flamma, earning Kwame

59
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:54,867
一种特殊的死亡。

59
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:54,867
a special death.

60
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,072
-把他带走。-你这个混蛋！

60
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,072
- Take him away.
- You bastard!

61
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,598
只有水。没有食物。

61
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,598
Water only. No food.

62
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,536
这减轻了他的一些战斗力。

62
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,536
This takes some of
the fight out of him.

63
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,396
酒。

63
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,396
Wine.

64
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,672
刚从高卢收到。

64
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,672
Just received from Gaul.

65
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,940
看。。。

65
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,940
Look...

66
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,478
这是我们的儿子。

66
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,478
it's our son.

67
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,747
和他父亲一样帅气。

67
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,747
As handsome as his father.

68
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:25,518
有成千上万的难民从庞贝城涌入，

68
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:25,518
There's thousands of refugees
pouring in from Pompeii,

69
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,721
更多在途中。

69
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,721
more en route.

70
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,290
提多答应给他们住房和食物。

70
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,290
Titus has promised
them housing and food.

71
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:32,858
这是我们一直在等待的时刻。

71
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:32,858
It's the moment
we've been waiting for.

72
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,629
外！

72
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,629
Out!

73
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:44,971
我和蒂莉亚和索罗谈过

73
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:44,971
I spoke with Tilia and Soro

74
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,473
以及参议院的其他一些围栏保姆。

74
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,473
and some of the other
fence-sitters in the Senate.

75
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:49,942
他们在摇摆不定。

75
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:49,942
They're wavering.

76
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,646
好吧，我们问了很多。

76
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,646
Well, we're asking
a lot of them.

77
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,850
他们的家庭和财富都受到了影响

77
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,850
Their families and
fortunes have suffered

78
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,286
在四帝之年。

78
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,286
in the Year of the
Four Emperors.

79
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,596
这对皇帝来说是一场赌博

79
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,596
And it is a gamble
for an Emperor

80
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,023
死去，被你取代。

80
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,023
to die and be replaced by you.

81
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,959
参议院看到提图斯耗尽了国库，这很有帮助。

81
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,959
It helps that the Senate sees
Titus draining the Treasury.

82
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,067
他们明天晚上会秘密会面，

82
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,067
They're meeting
tomorrow night, in secret,

83
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,798
听我说。

83
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,798
to listen to me.

84
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,925
他不在这里。

84
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,925
He is not here.

85
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,629
这是紧急的。

85
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,629
It is urgent.

86
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,110
妹妹！

86
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,110
Little sister!

87
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,918
Tenax，你现在在这里工作吗？

87
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,918
Tenax has you working here now?

88
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,754
是的，但现在被释放了。

88
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,754
Yes, but freed now.

89
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:12,492
茱拉，茱拉，我有机会买到她的自由。

89
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:12,492
Jula, Jula, I had the
chance to buy her freedom.

90
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,661
我保证我会为你做同样的事情。

90
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,661
I promise I'll do
the same for you.

91
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,798
我为你感到高兴。

91
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,798
I am so happy for you.

92
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:22,535
我希望是你被释放了。

92
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:22,535
I wish it had been
you who was freed.

93
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,069
你有什么要给我的吗？

93
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,069
Do you have something for me?

94
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,081
- 全部？-是的。

94
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,081
- All of them?
- Yes.

95
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,951
干的好。去。

95
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,951
Well done. Go.

96
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,559
我们离开太久了。

96
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,559
We've been away too long.

97
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,965
她说的对。我需要在我的情妇注意到之前回来。

97
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,965
She's right. I need to get back
before my mistress notices.

98
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,100
去。注意安全。

98
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,100
Go. Be safe.

99
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,942
以为是这样。

99
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,942
Think it was this way.

100
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,215
对不起。

100
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,215
Excuse me.

101
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,058
我们迷失了方向。

101
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,058
We've lost our way.

102
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,125
很容易做到。

102
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,125
Easy to do.

103
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,198
但我很荣幸能帮助你。

103
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,198
But I would be
honored to help you.

104
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:28,467
我必须去Esquiline。

104
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:28,467
I have to go to the Esquiline.

105
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,738
我可以告诉你。跟我来。

105
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,738
I can show you. Follow me.

106
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,015
这是出路。向左。

106
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,015
This is the way
out. To the left.

107
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,115
谢谢。

107
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,115
Thank you.

108
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,586
晚上的街道已经够危险的了。

108
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,586
The streets are
dangerous enough at night.

109
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,022
我会陪你一起去的。

109
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,022
I will accompany you.

110
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,255
请做。

110
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,255
Please do.

111
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,626
我们走吧。

111
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,626
Let's go.

112
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,240
我会确保她安全回家。

112
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,240
I'll see to it that she
gets home safely.

113
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,977
不要占便宜。

113
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,977
Do not take advantage.

114
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,854
这边。

114
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,854
This way.

115
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,789
所以，朱拉，你最终变成了奴隶......

115
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,789
And so, Jula, you ended
up becoming a slave...

116
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,859
在马苏斯领事的家里。

116
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,859
In the house of Consul Marsus.

117
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,561
你可以一个人出去吗？

117
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,561
And you can go out alone?

118
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,797
我可以，但我必须小心。

118
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,797
I can, but I have to be careful.

119
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,523
跟我说说你的兄弟们吧。

119
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,523
Tell me about your brothers.

120
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,691
他们听起来像是少数。

120
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,691
They sound like a handful.

121
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,292
想象一下与他们共用一个房间......

121
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,292
Imagine sharing
the room with them...

122
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,229
至少在家里，我们有自己的空间。

122
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,229
At least at home,
we had our space.

123
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:07,734
连绵起伏的丘陵，茂密的草，你可以在里面游泳。

123
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:07,734
Rolling hills, grass so
thick, you could swim in it.

124
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:11,136
我可以想象你的马喜欢它。

124
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:11,136
I can imagine your
horses loved it.

125
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,238
嗯。

125
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,238
Hmm.

126
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,845
我最近有这种感觉。

126
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,845
I have had this feeling of late.

127
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,916
我再也不会踏上我的祖国了。

127
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,916
That I will never set foot
in my homeland again.

128
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,722
这种感觉我很清楚。

128
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,722
That is a feeling I know well.

129
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,129
谢谢你带我走，Elia。

129
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,129
Thank you for walking me, Elia.

130
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,902
我能再见到你吗？

130
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:42,902
Can I see you again?

131
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,303
或。

131
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,303
Maybe.

132
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:18,437
提图斯·弗拉维乌斯·多米提亚努斯，一个多才多艺的人，

132
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:18,437
Titus Flavius Domitianus,
a man of many talents,

133
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:22,241
其中最重要的是惹恼了你的兄弟。

133
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:22,241
not least of which is
pissing off your brother.

134
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:31,051
或者你是说洗劫耶路撒冷是帕苏斯的主意？

134
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:31,051
Or are you saying that the sacking
of Jerusalem was Passus' idea?

135
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,053
我为此感到自豪。

135
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,053
I am rather proud of it.

136
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,857
不要用我哥哥的肮脏名字来称呼我。

136
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,857
And don't call me by
my brother's filthy name.

137
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,927
图密善会做的。

137
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,927
Domitian will do.

138
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,164
我知道你如何才能赢得你哥哥的信任

138
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,164
I know how you can
win your brother's trust

139
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,334
并让我们的派系恢复运行。

139
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,334
and get our faction
back up and running.

140
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:48,934
我听着呢。

140
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:48,934
I'm listening.

141
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,038
马苏斯召集了参议院会议。

141
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,038
Marsus has convened
a meeting of the Senate.

142
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,841
暗。

142
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,841
In secret.

143
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:59,078
所以，我猛扑过去，把他们都逮捕了，然后......

143
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:59,078
So, I swoop in,
arrest them all and...

144
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,648
拯救皇帝。

144
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,648
save the Emperor.

145
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,450
你只需要在那里。

145
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,450
You just need to be there.

146
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,086
看到这一切，让他们用自己的话吊死自己。

146
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,086
See it all and let them hang
themselves on their own words.

147
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,302
还有另一批难民正在前往罗马的途中。

147
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,302
There's another group of
refugees en route to Rome.

148
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,794
在Martius校园的公寓里准备一个营地。

148
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,794
Prepare an encampment on
the flats of Campus Martius.

149
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,831
粮食，木柴，城市警卫。

149
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,831
Provisions, firewood,
urban guards.

150
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,000
快点吧，我很忙。

150
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's make it quick, I'm busy.

151
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,568
如果你对我多一点尊重，我可以更好地为你服务

151
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,568
I could serve you better if you
treated me with more respect

152
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,169
比克拉克或客户的。

152
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,169
than that of a
clark or a client.

153
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,437
这是一种习惯。

153
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,437
It's a habit.

154
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,173
在指挥帐篷里呆了太多天。

154
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,173
Too many days in a command tent.

155
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,177
外。

155
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,177
Out.

156
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,251
你和我一样处于危险之中。

156
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,251
You are in jeopardy, as am I.

157
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,874
为了保护我们俩，

157
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,874
In order to protect us both,

158
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,224
我需要你暂停我的禁闭。

158
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,224
I need you to suspend
my confinement.

159
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,161
哥哥。

159
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,161
Brother.

160
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,529
这就是我说的那个人。

160
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,529
This is the man I spoke of.

161
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,166
我的客户，Tenax。

161
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,166
My client, Tenax.

162
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,570
这样，凯撒。

162
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,570
This way, Caesar.

163
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,577
你们两个，和我一起。

163
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,577
You two, with me.

164
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,623
你在令人不安的时刻勇敢地度过了夜晚。我感谢你。

164
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,623
You brave the night in
troubling times. I thank you.

165
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,493
几个世纪以来，我们的家庭

165
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,493
For centuries, our families

166
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,729
他们负责保护我们心爱的城市和帝国

166
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,729
have been charged with protecting
our beloved city and Empire

167
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,532
来自那些会激怒众神的人。

167
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,532
from those who
would anger the Gods.

168
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:37,336
然而，现在他们可怕的判决从天而降。

168
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:37,336
Yet now their terrible verdict
rains down from the sky.

169
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,472
我们都知道，随着维斯塔尔火焰的熄灭，

169
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,472
And we all know, that with
the Vestal flame extinguished,

170
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,344
我们不再受到灶神星和众神的保护，

170
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,344
we are no longer protected
by Vesta and the Gods,

171
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,280
这可能真的是时代的终结。

171
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,280
and this could truly
be the end of times.

172
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,085
所以我问自己，弟兄们，发生了什么变化

172
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,085
So I ask myself, brothers,
what has changed

173
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,154
从过去的快乐日子开始？

173
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,154
since the happy
days of the past?

174
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,624
我找不到其他答案，只能......

174
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,624
And I can find no
other answer but...

175
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,794
我们有一位新皇帝。

175
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,794
that we have a new Emperor.

176
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,966
轻踩，领事。

176
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,966
Tread lightly, Consul.

177
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,101
参议员，我们今天都轻装上阵，

177
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,101
We all tread lightly
today, Senator,

178
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,571
在灰烬上！

178
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,571
on ashes!

179
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,440
就想想皇帝吧

179
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,440
Just consider an Emperor

180
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,376
谁偏爱国家而不是罗马本身，

180
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,376
who favors the country
over Rome itself,

181
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,715
谁和一个异教徒的犹太女王躺在一起。

181
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,715
and who lies with a
heretic Judean Queen.

182
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,150
难怪众神选择埋葬我们！

182
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,150
No wonder the Gods
have chosen to bury us!

183
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,052
但是他已经抛弃了他的犹太女王，

183
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,052
But he has discarded
his Judean Queen,

184
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,654
并娶了一个罗马妻子。

184
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,654
and taken a Roman wife.

185
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,591
他娶了一个罗马妻子只会进一步加重他的罪行，

185
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,591
His taking a Roman wife only
further compounds his crime,

186
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,394
对于犹太毒蛇

186
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,394
for the Judean viper

187
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,996
仍然与他同床共枕

187
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,996
still shares his bed

188
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,334
并在他耳边嘶嘶作响。

188
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,334
and hisses her
poison in his ear.

189
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:45,538
希伯来神喜悦罗马跪下。

189
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:45,538
The Hebrew God delights
as Rome sinks to her knees.

190
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,509
那么罗马人呢？

190
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,509
And what of the Roman people?

191
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,277
我们的员工？

191
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,277
Our People?

192
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,746
我们的客户？

192
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,746
Our clients?

193
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,716
我们的神圣职责？

193
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,716
Our sacred duty?

194
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,022
我们的人睡在下水道里

194
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,022
Our people sleep in the sewer

195
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,557
而提多打开了闸门

195
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,557
while Titus opens
the flood gates

196
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,692
成千上万的难民。

196
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,692
to thousands of refugees.

197
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,528
他给这些陌生人喂奶

197
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,528
He suckles these strangers

198
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,999
并把剩下的钱花在花哨的纪念碑上

198
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,999
and spends what's left on
garish monuments to himself

199
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,200
和他的家人，

199
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,200
and his family,

200
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,237
而罗马人民却在挨饿！

200
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,237
while the people of Rome starve!

201
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,373
羞耻！

201
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,373
Shame!

202
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,709
没有人质疑变革的必要性。

202
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,709
No one questions
the need for change.

203
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,680
唯一的问题是，它能成功吗？

203
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,680
The only question
is, can it succeed?

204
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,749
它可以而且必须。

204
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,749
It can and it must.

205
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,752
我向你们保证，遥远的军团，

205
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,752
I assure you, the
distant legions,

206
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,624
近身卫兵，罗马人民，

206
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,624
the close guards,
the people of Rome,

207
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,394
众神自己也会为这种变化鼓掌！

207
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,394
and the Gods themselves
will applaud the change!

208
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,031
- 尼禄的命运！- 尼禄的命运！

208
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,031
- The fate of Nero!
- The fate of Nero!

209
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,619
马苏斯领事，

209
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,619
Consul Marsus,

210
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:12,459
参议员托雷尔和塞普尔修斯，都是叛徒！

210
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:12,459
Senators Torel and
Sepulcius, traitors all!

211
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,461
逮捕他们。

211
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,461
Arrest them.

212
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,563
主。

212
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,563
Lord.

213
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,769
众神恳求我们采取行动，

213
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,769
The Gods beseech us to act,

214
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,805
现在是时候了。

214
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,805
and the time is now.

215
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:40,819
执政官马尔苏斯、参议员托雷尔和塞普尔修斯

215
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:40,819
The Consul Marsus, the
Senators Torel and Sepulcius

216
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,722
特此以叛国罪被捕。

216
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,722
are hereby arrested for treason.

217
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,491
抓住他！

217
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,491
Take him!

218
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:48,861
还有他。

218
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:48,861
And him.

219
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:50,863
拿走他们！

219
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:50,863
Take them!

220
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,368
和我在一起。

220
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,368
With me.

221
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,643
所以你为蓝军和白军开车？

221
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,643
So you drove for the
Blues and the Whites?

222
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,412
11个第一。

222
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,412
Eleven firsts.

223
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,013
哇。

223
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,013
Wow.

224
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,615
发生了什么事？

224
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,615
What happened?

225
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,419
酒。。。和高尚的生活。

225
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,419
Wine... and high living.

226
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,955
天蝎座就是这样做的。他仍然开车。

226
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,955
Scorpus does
that. He still drives.

227
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,458
就是这样，还有更多。

227
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,458
It was that and more.

228
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,259
把一个人放在战车上需要很多，

228
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,259
Takes a lot to put
a man in a chariot,

229
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,862
更让他放弃。

229
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,862
and even more
for him to give it up.

230
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:58,797
那么，你为什么要这样做？

230
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:58,797
So, why did you?

231
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,743
我开始参加比赛是因为马匹。

231
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,743
I started racing
because of the horses.

232
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,346
像你一样，

232
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,346
Like you,

233
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:15,748
我能感觉到他们。

233
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:15,748
I can feel them.

234
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,419
但赛车是不同的。

234
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,419
But racing is different.

235
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:26,226
四匹马的比赛是自杀，你......以某种方式生存。

235
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:26,226
A four-horse race is a
suicide you... somehow survive.

236
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,229
我看到六个朋友死在赛道上，

236
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,229
I saw half-a-dozen
friends die on the track,

237
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,164
我自己也勉强避免了死亡

237
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,164
and I barely
avoided death myself

238
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,701
比这更多的次数。

238
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,701
more times than that.

239
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,772
然后，有一天我离开了那条轨道，我完成了。

239
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,772
And then, one day I walked
off that track, and I was done.

240
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,546
一旦你开始思考死亡，

240
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,546
Once you start
thinking about death,

241
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,647
结束了。

241
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,647
it's over.

242
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,788
我的兄弟们都想参加比赛。

242
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,788
My brothers both want to race.

243
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,589
你担心他们。

243
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,589
You worry about them.

244
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,567
生活很少会按照你期望的方式进行。

244
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,567
Life rarely goes
the way you expect.

245
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,617
嘘。这是给你的。

245
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,617
Psst. This is for you.

246
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,753
只是一会儿。

246
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,753
Just a short while.

247
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,497
哥哥。

247
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,497
Brother.

248
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,072
我担心我会空着肚子死去。

248
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,072
I feared I was to die
on an empty stomach.

249
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,641
皇帝的弟弟

249
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,641
The Emperor's brother

250
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,809
似乎对你的死感兴趣。

250
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,809
seems to have an
interest in your death.

251
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,713
这种感觉是相互的，兄弟。

251
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,713
The feeling is mutual, brother.

252
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,615
但我认为他会先如愿以偿。

252
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,615
But I think he will
get his wish first.

253
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,718
观众想要二番战。

253
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,718
The crowd would like a rematch.

254
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,555
他们带着复仇的兴奋。

254
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,555
They carry the
excitement of revenge.

255
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,634
多少次在战斗前夕，

255
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,634
How many times
on the eve of battle,

256
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,803
你与死亡和平相处了吗？

256
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,803
did you make your
peace with death?

257
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,605
太多了，数不清。

257
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,605
Too many to count.

258
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,674
每一次，你都欺骗了死亡。

258
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,674
And each time,
you cheated death.

259
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:30,282
在战斗中，我的人民以我们的咆哮而闻名

259
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:30,282
In battle, my people
are known for our roar

260
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,719
当我们冲锋时，吓唬我们的敌人。

260
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,719
as we charge,
terrifying our enemy.

261
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:36,355
在我们奔向他们的刀剑和盾牌之前，

261
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:36,355
Before we run at their
swords and shields,

262
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,892
我们低声恳求死亡。

262
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,892
we whisper a quiet
entreaty to death.

263
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,402
死神啊，如果你愿意，就带我去吧，

263
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,402
Take me if you will, O Death,

264
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,271
但让我活着不是更好吗

264
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,271
but is it not better
to let me live

265
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,574
并通过杀人来服侍你？

265
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,574
and serve you by killing others?

266
00:22:58,912 --> 00:22:59,912
大胆的词语。

266
00:22:58,912 --> 00:22:59,912
Bold words.

267
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,148
亲自向死神提出交易。

267
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,148
Offering a deal
to Death himself.

268
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,616
她自己。

268
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,616
Herself.

269
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:06,685
死亡是一个女人。

269
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:06,685
Death is a woman.

270
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:09,655
到目前为止，她一直在听我的话。

270
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:09,655
She has so far listened to me.

271
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:12,092
哈莉娅，也许她会听你的。

271
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:12,092
Halja, perhaps she
will listen to you.

272
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:18,698
我想她太爱弗拉玛了，救不了我，兄弟。

272
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:18,698
I think she is too in love with
Flamma to save me, brother.

273
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,134
我什么时候死？

273
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,134
When do I die?

274
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:27,673
五天。

274
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:27,673
Five days.

275
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,753
我的朋友给我带来了酒。

275
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,753
And my friend brings me wine.

276
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:46,192
短暂的一生仍然可以是美好的生活。

276
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:46,192
A short life can
still be a good life.

277
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,603
我欠你的债，兄弟。

277
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,603
I am in your debt, brother.

278
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,405
我只担心你的安全，就像我担心父亲的安全一样。

278
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,405
I worry only for your
safety, as I did Father's.

279
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,307
你认为参议院会如何反应？

279
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,307
How do you think
the Senate will react?

280
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,909
他们会看的。

280
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,909
They'll watch.

281
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,576
并等待暴徒的反应。

281
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,576
And wait for the
reaction of the mob.

282
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:07,313
呵呵，那你有什么建议？

282
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:07,313
Huh, so what do you suggest?

283
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,847
增加谷物。

283
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,847
Increase the grain dole.

284
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,153
波尔图？告诉我。

284
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,153
Porto? Tell me.

285
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,357
我们的粮食储备足以使它翻倍。

285
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,357
We have grain stores
enough to double it.

286
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,792
然后这样做。

286
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,792
Then do so.

287
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,199
还有什么？

287
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,199
What else?

288
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,269
将首届运动会从50天增加到100天。

288
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,269
Increase the Inaugural Games
from fifty days to a hundred.

289
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,508
并带回人民的英雄。

289
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,508
And bring back
the people's hero.

290
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,711
让天蝎座再次为黄金派系而战。

290
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,711
Let Scorpus race again
for the Gold Faction.

291
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:39,813
这是非常明智的。

291
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:39,813
That's very wise.

292
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,790
派系主主在他们的感情中取代了我，

292
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,790
The faction owners have
replaced me in their affection,

293
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,717
所以我要把他们换成暴徒。

293
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,717
so I shall replace
them in the mob's.

294
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,019
黄金派系将恢复。

294
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,019
The Gold faction
will be reinstated.

295
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,721
你有我的话。

295
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,721
You have my word.

296
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:56,663
我哥哥答应了我

296
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:56,663
My brother has granted me

297
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,131
另一个为他服务的机会。

297
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,131
another opportunity
to serve him.

298
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,366
我将组织增加的首届运动会

298
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,366
I am to organize the
increased Inaugural Games

299
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:01,934
我们的弗拉维安圆形剧场。

299
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:01,934
of our Flavian Amphitheater.

300
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,203
赌注的巨额将是你喜欢的。

300
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,203
The enormity of the
wagers will be to your liking.

301
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:05,971
毫无疑问。

301
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:05,971
No doubt.

302
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,240
但谁将成为这些游戏的主人呢？

302
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,240
But who will be
master of these games?

303
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,845
- 帕苏斯？- 他有经验。

303
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,845
- Passus?
- He has experience.

304
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:15,248
各派系的礼貌和对他们的尊重。

304
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:15,248
Courtesy of the factions
and beholden to them.

305
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,750
你还有别的建议吗？

305
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,750
You have another suggestion?

306
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:19,152
那我呢？

306
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:19,152
What about me?

307
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:24,723
你雄心勃勃。

307
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:24,723
You are ambitious.

308
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,692
我对你毫不隐瞒。

308
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,692
I've made no secret
of that with you.

309
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,996
你确实有一定的才能。

309
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,996
You do have certain talents.

310
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,164
但娱乐艺术是其中之一吗？

310
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,164
But is the art of
entertainment one of them?

311
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,169
恕我直言，殿下......

311
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,169
With all due respect,
Your Highness...

312
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:43,442
你太高了

312
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:43,442
you are too far
above the lower order

313
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,177
知道他们真正想要什么。

313
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,177
to know what they really want.

314
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:48,080
我知道，因为我是他们中的一员。

314
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:48,080
I know, because I'm one of them.

315
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,917
我感受到了他们的饥饿，

315
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,917
I have felt their hunger,

316
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,086
并生活在他们的污秽中。

316
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,086
and lived in their filth.

317
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,222
我知道他们害怕什么，我知道他们渴望什么，

317
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,222
I know what they fear,
and I know what they crave,

318
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:00,960
我可以设计出满足这种渴望的娱乐方式。

318
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:00,960
and I can devise entertainment
that will feed that craving.

319
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,297
它们比你想象的更基础。

319
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,297
They're more base
than you can imagine.

320
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,201
很好，一个测试。

320
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,201
Very well, a test.

321
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,938
让我们看看你如何处决叛徒。

321
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,938
Let's see how you do with
the execution of the traitors.

322
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,174
当你这样做时，

322
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,174
And while you do so,

323
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,844
让斯科普斯回到我的一辆黄金战车上。

323
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,844
get Scorpus back in one
of my Golden chariots.

324
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,795
哎呀！哎呀！

324
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,795
Hyah! Hyah!

325
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:42,836
哎呀！

325
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:42,836
Hyah!

326
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,177
你可以的！加油！

326
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,177
You can do it! Come on!

327
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,959
天蝎座！天蝎座！天蝎座！

327
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,959
Scorpus! Scorpus! Scorpus!

328
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,833
-哦！是天蝎座！-女士 们。

328
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,833
- Oh! It's Scorpus!
- Ladies.

329
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:30,884
你被逮捕了。

329
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:30,884
You are under arrest.

330
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:32,986
不。

330
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:32,986
No.

331
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:36,522
我是天蝎座，一个派系的首席战车手。

331
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:36,522
I'm Scorpus, lead
charioteer of a faction.

332
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:38,157
把你的手拿开。

332
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:38,157
Get your hands off me.

333
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:57,477
哎呀！你听着。我是伟大的天蝎座。

333
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:57,477
Oi! You listen. I am
The Great Scorpus.

334
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:58,944
不是你的动物之一。

334
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:58,944
Not one of your animals.

335
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,482
皇帝会听到的！

335
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,482
The Emperor will hear of this!

336
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,502
你这样对我。

336
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,502
You did this to me.

337
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:25,771
你这头猪。

337
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:25,771
You pig.

338
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,777
好吧，你和天蝎座玩得很开心。

338
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,777
Well, you had your
fun with Scorpus.

339
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,045
现在，让他出去。

339
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,045
Now, let him out.

340
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,680
您因非法博彩而被捕。

340
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,680
You were arrested
for illegal betting.

341
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,448
非法投注？

341
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,448
Illegal betting?

342
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,984
这是来自你们这样的人的笑话。是的？

342
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,984
It's a joke coming from
the likes of you. Yes?

343
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:40,854
对我来说很有趣，我的朋友，

343
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:40,854
Funny for me, my friend,

344
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,323
不是真的适合你。

344
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,323
not really for you.

345
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:47,594
但是，为了我们的旧友谊，

345
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:47,594
But, for the sake
of our old friendship,

346
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:48,894
我可能会结束这一切，

346
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:48,894
I could probably end this,

347
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,765
如果你只是简单地签回黄金派系。

347
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,765
if you simply sign back
to the Gold Faction.

348
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,037
哦，看在他妈的份上，天蝎座。

348
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,037
Oh, for fuck sake's, Scorpus.

349
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,506
你拥有黄金派系25%的股份。

349
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,506
You own 25% of the Gold faction.

350
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:02,342
它值十倍......一百倍以上

350
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:02,342
It's worth ten times... a
hundred times more than

351
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:05,778
莱托付给你的可怜的 600,000 美元！

351
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:05,778
the measly 600,000
that Leto's paying you!

352
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,782
去他妈的自己。

352
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,782
Go fuck yourself.

353
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:22,028
等。等！

353
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:22,028
Wait. Wait!

354
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:31,037
我会为金牌而战，

354
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:31,037
I will drive for the Gold,

355
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:36,308
但你再也不叫我朋友了。

355
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:36,308
but you don't ever
call me a friend again.

356
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,078
不错的选择...

356
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,078
Good choice...

357
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,513
我的朋友。

357
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,513
my friend.

358
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:44,316
嘿！

358
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:44,316
Hey!

359
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:47,487
嘿，你放我出去，你这个小混蛋！

359
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:47,487
Hey, you let me
out, you little shit!

360
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,094
为灶神星祈祷。

360
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,094
A prayer for Vesta.

361
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:57,297
哦，永恒炉膛的女神。

361
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:57,297
Oh Goddess of
the eternal hearth.

362
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,334
你的祷告会被垂听。

362
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,334
Your prayer will be heard.

363
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,814
科妮莉亚。看看你

363
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,814
Cornelia. Look at you,

364
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,650
处女座维斯塔利斯千里马！

364
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,650
Virgo Vestalis Maxima!

365
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,719
维斯塔尔酋长。

365
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,719
Chief Vestal.

366
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,355
你父亲和我为你的提升而欢欣鼓舞。

366
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,355
Your father and I
rejoice at your elevation.

367
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:28,193
一个女人被棍棒和鞭打致死，

367
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:28,193
A woman clubbed
and flogged to death,

368
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,262
因为维斯塔大火熄灭了。

368
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,262
because the vestal
fires went out.

369
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,232
那是你骄傲的源泉吗？

369
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,232
That is a source of your pride?

370
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,301
那么，这次会议是关于什么的呢？

370
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,301
So, what is this meeting about?

371
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:39,372
- 你可能没有听说过... - 维斯塔尔人听到了一切。

371
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:39,372
- You may not have heard...
- The Vestals hear everything.

372
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,509
作为 Vestal Matron，您为众神代言。

372
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,509
As Vestal Matron,
you speak for the Gods.

373
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,012
如果我们一起去皇帝面前

373
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,012
If we go before the
Emperor together

374
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:48,882
- 并恳求你父亲的性命...... - 不。

374
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:48,882
- and plead for your father's life...
- No.

375
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,285
Cornelia，你的父亲需要你。

375
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,285
Cornelia, your father needs you.

376
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,453
他不需要我，

376
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,453
He did not need me,

377
00:30:54,554 --> 00:30:59,125
当他把我关在这个金笼子里将近 30 年时。

377
00:30:54,554 --> 00:30:59,125
when he condemned me to this
golden cage for nearly 30 years.

378
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,661
我们给了你与众神交流的机会。

378
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,661
We gave you opportunity
to commune with the Gods.

379
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,631
我从来没有听说过。一次都没有！

379
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,631
I've never heard them. Not once!

380
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,336
你把我关在这监狱里，

380
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,336
You placed me in this prison,

381
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:11,371
你派我来这里，不是为了我的利益，

381
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:11,371
you sent me here,
not for my benefit,

382
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,270
但为了你自己和我兄弟的荣耀。

382
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,270
but for your own glory
and that of my brother.

383
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,642
放弃你是我的责任，

383
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,642
It was my duty to give you up,

384
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:19,412
现在，这是你的职责

384
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:19,412
and now, it is your duty

385
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,280
帮助拯救你的父亲

385
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,280
to help save your father

386
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:24,150
从Tarpeian岩石上扔下来。

386
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:24,150
from being thrown
off the Tarpeian rock.

387
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,920
如果可以的话，我会帮忙把他推开。

387
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,920
I would help push
him off if I could.

388
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,190
不要说这样的话。

388
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,190
Do not say such a thing.

389
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:33,692
你是他的女儿。

389
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:33,692
You are his daughter.

390
00:31:34,794 --> 00:31:36,229
我是维斯塔处女。

390
00:31:34,794 --> 00:31:36,229
I'm a Vestal Virgin.

391
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,566
我不再是他的女儿，

391
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,566
I am no longer his daughter,

392
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:42,634
或你的。

392
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:42,634
or yours.

393
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:47,673
科妮莉亚！

393
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:47,673
Cornelia!

394
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,443
我求求你了。

394
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,443
I beg of you.

395
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,336
你收到我的信了吗？

395
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,336
Did you get my letter?

396
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,140
我明白你有多爱

396
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,140
I understand how much you love

397
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,674
你的西班牙马...

397
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,674
your Spanish horses...

398
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:25,310
但请告诉我你在来之前去过浴场。

398
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:25,310
but please tell me you visited
the baths before coming.

399
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:27,747
-总是。- “总是，”他说。

399
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:27,747
- Always.
- "Always," he says.

400
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:33,486
哦。你确实去洗澡了。

400
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:33,486
Oh. You did go to the baths.

401
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,556
你的话掩盖了真相。

401
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,556
Your words hide the truth.

402
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,092
我知道你有多喜欢马厩的味道。

402
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,092
I know how much you
love the smell of stables.

403
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:41,326
哦。。。从不。

403
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:41,326
Oh... never.

404
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:49,001
我想把你从这里偷走。

404
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:49,001
I want to steal you
away from here.

405
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,506
然后你会看到我被钉在十字架上。

405
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,506
Then you would see
me nailed to the cross.

406
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,842
马苏斯被关在牢房里。

406
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,842
Marsus is in a cell.

407
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:57,242
他不能再伤害你了。

407
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:57,242
He can no longer harm you.

408
00:32:57,844 --> 00:32:59,112
我的情妇呢？

408
00:32:57,844 --> 00:32:59,112
What about my mistress?

409
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,613
我们会买到你的自由。

409
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,613
We'll buy your freedom.

410
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,382
用什么？

410
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,382
With what?

411
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,684
我有我的工资和一小部分梭哈费。

411
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,684
I have my wages and the
small portion of the stud fees.

412
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:08,587
在几场胜利之后，这将是值得的。

412
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:08,587
After a few wins, it
will be worth something.

413
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:11,257
三千塞斯特斯？

413
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:11,257
Three thousand sesterces?

414
00:33:14,527 --> 00:33:16,796
因为那是她为我付出的代价。

414
00:33:14,527 --> 00:33:16,796
Because that is
what she paid for me.

415
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,275
我相信

415
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,275
I believe

416
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,778
如果你有钱，你会救我。

416
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,778
if you had the money,
you would save me.

417
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:48,361
朱拉，停下。

417
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:48,361
Jula, stop.

418
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,697
否则，我不想停下来。

418
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,697
Otherwise, I won't want to stop.

419
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,467
如果我不想停下来怎么办？

419
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,467
What if I don't want to stop?

420
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:03,710
我担心......

420
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:03,710
I feared...

421
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:07,079
我的第一次

421
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:07,079
my first time

422
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,648
会和...

422
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,648
would be with...

423
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,755
我希望它和你在一起。

423
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,755
I want it to be
with you instead.

424
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:21,628
至少我知道它应该是什么感觉。

424
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:21,628
At least I know
how it should feel.

425
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,331
我也不知道应该有什么感觉。

425
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,331
I don't know how
it should feel either.

426
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:30,903
然后。。。

426
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:30,903
Then...

427
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:32,771
让我们一起发现它。

427
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:32,771
let us discover it together.

428
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:44,817
是否确定？

428
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:44,817
Are you sure?

429
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:46,751
我敢肯定。

429
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:46,751
I am sure.

430
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,034
在我看来，它们是一样的。

430
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,034
They look the same to me.

431
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,304
是的。看起来是这样，

431
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,304
Yes. It would appear so,

432
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,940
但它们要轻得多。

432
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,940
but they're much, much lighter.

433
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,577
更难驾驶，但速度要快得多。

433
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,577
More difficult to
drive, but much faster.

434
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,750
那我的付款呢？

434
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,750
And what about my payment?

435
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,518
我们稍后再谈钱。

435
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,518
Let's talk about money later.

436
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:27,527
这是怎麽？

436
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:27,527
What is this?

437
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,795
我该怎么办？

437
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,795
What am I supposed
to do with this?

438
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,467
哦。

438
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,467
Oh.

439
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,882
批准。

439
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,882
Approved.

440
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:52,918
批准。

440
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:52,918
Approved.

441
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,755
- 一切都好吗？- 都很好。

441
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,755
- All good?
- All good.

442
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:25,585
天蝎座！天蝎座！天蝎座！

442
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:25,585
Scorpus! Scorpus! Scorpus!

443
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:28,887
来吧，快点！

443
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:28,887
Come on, faster!

444
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,025
天蝎座再次出手。

444
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,025
Scorpus makes his move again.

445
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,659
这可能是他本周的第三场胜利。

445
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,659
Could be his third
victory this week.

446
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,329
天蝎座！天蝎座！天蝎座！

446
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,329
Scorpus! Scorpus! Scorpus!

447
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,534
你是对的，图密善。

447
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,534
You were right, Domitian.

448
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,536
暴民内容，

448
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,536
The mob content,

449
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,940
参议院畏缩不前。

449
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,940
and the Senate cowed.

450
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:52,778
- 愿我们的血液占上风。- 直到罗马本身沦陷。

450
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:52,778
- May our blood prevail.
- Till Rome itself falls.

451
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,018
去！去！

451
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,018
Go! Go!

452
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,827
哦，亲爱的！

452
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,827
Oh, dear!

453
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:12,998
你去哪儿？

453
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:12,998
Where are you going?

454
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,333
比赛还没有结束。

454
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,333
The race is not finished.

455
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,936
我的司机遭遇了海难。我为什么要留下来？

455
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,936
My drivers shipwrecked.
Why should I stay?

456
00:37:25,144 --> 00:37:28,715
我开始理解人群对这个天蝎座的热爱。

456
00:37:25,144 --> 00:37:28,715
I'm beginning to understand
the crowd's love for this Scorpus.

457
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:38,958
是的！

457
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:38,958
Yes!

458
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:45,398
天蝎座！天蝎座！天蝎座！

458
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:45,398
Scorpus! Scorpus! Scorpus!

459
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,969
啊，胜利的派系老板！

459
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,969
Ah, the victorious
faction owner!

460
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,438
我有一个问题：

460
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,438
I have a question:

461
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:56,409
投注总是在比赛开始前停止？

461
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:56,409
the betting is always
stopped before the race starts?

462
00:37:56,509 --> 00:37:58,711
-答案是肯定的。-为什么？

462
00:37:56,509 --> 00:37:58,711
- Of course.
- Why?

463
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:00,413
一直都是这样。

463
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:00,413
It's always been done that way.

464
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:01,914
这就是法律。

464
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:01,914
That's the law.

465
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,349
你总是遵守法律吗？

465
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,349
Do you always follow the law?

466
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:07,152
你把钱留在桌子上，

466
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:07,152
You are leaving
money on the table,

467
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:08,655
很多。

467
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:08,655
lots of it.

468
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:12,057
在努米底亚，有赛马、斗鸡、摔跤、

468
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:12,057
In Numidia, with horse
racing, cock fighting, wrestling,

469
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,293
投注贯穿整场比赛。

469
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,293
the betting goes
for the whole match.

470
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:15,561
如果你被抓住了怎么办？

470
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:15,561
And what if you get caught?

471
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,931
违法的关键是不要这样做。

471
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,931
The key to breaking
the law is not to.

472
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,469
我们所要做的就是改变投注系统。

472
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,469
All we have to do is
change the betting system.

473
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,405
我们如何做到这一点，并接受新的赌注？

473
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,405
And how do we do that,
and take the new bets?

474
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,907
我们把你的孩子放在看台上。

474
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,907
We put your kids in the stands.

475
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,878
嗯。

475
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,878
Hmm.

476
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:51,097
“恭喜你。

476
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:51,097
"Congratulations.

477
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:53,266
“你把你的黄金派系找回来了。

477
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:53,266
"You have your
Gold Faction back.

478
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,400
“你的奖金，

478
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,400
"Your winnings,

479
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:57,403
“否则你的孩子会继续死去，

479
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:57,403
"or your boys will
continue to die,

480
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,773
“你的秘密将不再是秘密。

480
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,773
"and your secret will
be a secret no more.

481
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,974
“这永远不会结束。

481
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,974
"This will never end.

482
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:03,943
“除非你结束它。”

482
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:03,943
"Unless you end it."

483
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:06,980
Tenax，有人想和你谈谈。

483
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:06,980
Tenax, somebody
wants to speak with you.

484
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,623
他想和你开会。

484
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,623
He wants a conference with you.

485
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,682
告诉他我早上第一件事就是去那里。

485
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,682
Tell him I'll be there
first thing in the morning.

486
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:20,025
他在等你，

486
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:20,025
He's waiting for you,

487
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,394
现在。

487
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,394
now.

488
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,039
Tenax 来了。

488
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,039
Tenax is here.

489
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:40,413
对不起，兄弟，我的一个客户。

489
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:40,413
Excuse me, brother,
one of my clients.

490
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,719
外！

490
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,719
Out!

491
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:50,923
我以为我会亲自领取我的奖金。

491
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:50,923
I thought I would collect
my winnings in person.

492
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,159
来了，多米纳斯。

492
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,159
Coming, Dominus.

493
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:55,260
这些大赌注都是靠信用进行的。

493
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:55,260
These big bets
are made on credit.

494
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:57,963
我们必须等待贵族偿还债务。

494
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:57,963
We have to wait for the
patricians to pay their debts.

495
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:00,934
明天把你欠的钱给我。

495
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:00,934
Bring me what you owe tomorrow.

496
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:03,202
理解？

496
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:03,202
Understood?

497
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:18,885
你！你偷了我的司机。

497
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:18,885
You! You stole my driver.

498
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:20,887
你必须和天蝎座谈谈。

498
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:20,887
You'll have to talk
to Scorpus about that.

499
00:40:20,987 --> 00:40:22,621
天蝎座达成了交易。

499
00:40:20,987 --> 00:40:22,621
Scorpus made a deal.

500
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:24,099
他现在属于白派。

500
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:24,099
He belongs to the
White Faction now.

501
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:25,233
他似乎不这么认为。

501
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:25,233
He doesn't seem to think so.

502
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,427
如果你想要忠诚，你应该给你的男人更多的钱。

502
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,427
If you want loyalty, you
should pay your men more.

503
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:29,896
你这个该死的暴发户！

503
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:29,896
You fucking upstart!

504
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,900
我希望他回来。

504
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,900
I want him back.

505
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:40,407
你们，你们所有人，

505
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:40,407
You, all of you,

506
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:43,009
你认为众神膏你来领导吗？

506
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:43,009
you think the Gods have
anointed you to lead?

507
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,344
你错了。

507
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,344
You're wrong.

508
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:47,047
你的位置和你杀死的那些人一样脆弱

508
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:47,047
Your positions are as fragile
as those the men you killed

509
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:49,548
要到达你所在的位置，现在让开。

509
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:49,548
to get to where you
are, now step aside.

510
00:40:52,152 --> 00:40:53,271
还是我应该打电话给警卫？

510
00:40:52,152 --> 00:40:53,271
Or should I call the guards?

511
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:55,922
我是个大忙人。

511
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:55,922
I'm a busy man.

512
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:05,197
谢谢你，参议员。

512
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:05,197
Thank you, Senator.

513
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:15,275
特纳克斯！你要走了吗

513
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:15,275
Tenax! Are you
just going to leave

514
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,077
从今天开始不给我我的份额？

514
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,077
without giving me
my share from today?

515
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:19,612
我很着急。

515
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:19,612
I'm in a hurry.

516
00:41:19,713 --> 00:41:20,847
嘿，你怎么了？

516
00:41:19,713 --> 00:41:20,847
Hey, what is wrong with you?

517
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:23,583
- 你喝醉了？-是的，我是。

517
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:23,583
- You're drunk?
- Yes, I am.

518
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,619
我需要我的钱。我有一场胜利的狂欢要付出代价。

518
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,619
And I need my money. I
have a victory orgy to pay for.

519
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,288
赊账。

519
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,288
Have it on credit.

520
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:30,322
我赢了。

520
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:30,322
I won.

521
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:32,391
我们的派系赢了。

521
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:32,391
Our faction won.

522
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,094
来吧，天蝎座必须得到报酬！

522
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,094
Come on, Scorpus must be paid!

523
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:36,096
当我拥有它时。

523
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:36,096
When I have it.

524
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:38,864
那辆购物车里有什么？

524
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:38,864
What is in that cart?

525
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,512
我不想听到你的任何其他消息，

525
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,512
I don't want to hear
anything else from you,

526
00:41:43,536 --> 00:41:44,871
直到我有钱。

526
00:41:43,536 --> 00:41:44,871
until I have my money.

527
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,139
我想要我的钱！

527
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,139
I want my money!

528
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:50,909
我想要我的钱。

528
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:50,909
I want my money.

529
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:01,653
-什么？-还没有。

529
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:01,653
- Anything?
- Not yet.

530
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,655
我已经按照你的要求回到了伊德斯。

530
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,655
I have returned on the
Ides as you requested.

531
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:40,193
你能帮我吗？

531
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:40,193
Would you help me?

532
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:43,929
有一个人，

532
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:43,929
There's a man,

533
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,331
特纳克斯。

533
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,331
Tenax.

534
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:48,034
一个罪犯。

534
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:48,034
A criminal.

535
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:50,268
你认识他吗？

535
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:50,268
Do you know him?

536
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,106
是的。

536
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,106
Yes.

537
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:56,076
他把我的大女儿当奴隶。

537
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:56,076
He owned my eldest
daughter as a slave.

538
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:58,744
我为她买了自由，

538
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:58,744
I bought her freedom,

539
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,780
现在她和我为他工作。

539
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,780
and now she and I work for him.

540
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,215
他带着他罪行的恶臭。

540
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,215
He carries the
stench of his crimes.

541
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:06,318
你也被那股恶臭玷污了。

541
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:06,318
You are tainted
by that stench, too.

542
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:10,989
我只为我的孩子做这件事。

542
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:10,989
I only do it for my children.

543
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,626
然而，你却试图欺骗我

543
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,626
And yet, you
sought to deceive me

544
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:16,896
用我来解救你的女儿。

544
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:16,896
and use me to
free your daughter.

545
00:43:16,996 --> 00:43:18,364
- 不，不，不... - 你假设

545
00:43:16,996 --> 00:43:18,364
- No, no, no...
- You assumed

546
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:21,735
我对父母怀有恶意，

546
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:21,735
I bear ill will
toward my parents,

547
00:43:21,835 --> 00:43:23,045
你认为你可以使用它

547
00:43:21,835 --> 00:43:23,045
and you thought
you could use that

548
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:24,670
将您的孩子从他们手中解放出来。

548
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:24,670
to free your child from them.

549
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:29,675
是的。

549
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:29,675
Yes.

550
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:32,445
关于罗马，你还有很多东西需要学习

550
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:32,445
There's much you still
need to learn of Rome

551
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:34,079
和 Vestals。

551
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:34,079
and the Vestals.

552
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:38,385
我屬於這座城市，而不是我父親。

552
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:38,385
I belong to this
city, not to my father.

553
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:42,355
他密谋破坏神圣的秩序，必须死。

553
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:42,355
He conspired to break the
divine order, and must die.

554
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:47,960
你不配为我代祷。

554
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:47,960
You are not worthy
of my intercession.

555
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:50,530
不，拜托。我的女儿，她是无辜的，

555
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:50,530
No, please. My daughter,
she's an innocent,

556
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,097
她值得你保护。

556
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,097
she's worthy of your protection.

557
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:55,034
只有罗马值得我保护。

557
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:55,034
Only Rome is worthy
of my protection.

558
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,257
怎么了？

558
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,257
What's wrong?

559
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,161
黑暗的一天。

559
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,161
A dark day.

560
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:24,164
同意。

560
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:24,164
Agreed.

561
00:44:25,197 --> 00:44:26,266
目前。

561
00:44:25,197 --> 00:44:26,266
At the moment.

562
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:33,072
那是什么样子？

562
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:33,072
What is that look?

563
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:37,242
我正在重新考虑我与你的关系。

563
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:37,242
I'm reconsidering my
association with you.

564
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:07,460
尼卡。妮卡，醒醒！

564
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:07,460
Nica. Nica, wake up!

565
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:33,052
你留在这里！

565
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:33,052
You stay here!

566
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:14,027
特纳克斯！特纳克斯！

566
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:14,027
Tenax! Tenax!

567
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:18,530
脸上有疤痕的大个子。

567
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:18,530
Big man with scars on his face.

568
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:22,068
锁上门。

568
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:22,068
Lock the door.

569
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:33,445
- 达契亚在哪里？-不知道。

569
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:33,445
- Where's Dacia?
- No idea.

570
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:34,547
快 点。

570
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:34,547
Hurry.

571
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:50,789
在这里等候。

571
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:50,789
Wait here.

572
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:42,608
放下刀。

572
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:42,608
Drop the knife.

573
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:59,659
你应该付给你的男人更多的钱。

573
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:59,659
You should pay your men more.

574
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:09,867
你想活下去吗？

574
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:09,867
You want to live?

575
00:51:11,003 --> 00:51:12,038
刀，

575
00:51:11,003 --> 00:51:12,038
The knife,

576
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:13,672
慢慢移动

576
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:13,672
move it slowly

577
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:17,777
到你虚弱的手上。把它传给我，下手。

577
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:17,777
to your weak hand.
Pass it to me, underhand.

578
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:35,628
如果你想做某事，就自己做。

578
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:35,628
If you want something
done, do it yourself.

579
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:40,300
现在，我已经从你那里夺走了一切，

579
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:40,300
Now, that I've taken
everything from you,

580
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,934
我要杀了你。

580
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,934
I'm going to kill you.

581
00:51:49,675 --> 00:51:52,911
很好，你从与暴徒和低等人的战斗中学到了东西。

581
00:51:49,675 --> 00:51:52,911
Good, you learned from
fighting thugs and low-lifes.

582
00:51:53,012 --> 00:51:56,181
我从地球上最伟大的军队中战斗中学到了东西。

582
00:51:53,012 --> 00:51:56,181
I learned from fighting in the
greatest army on this Earth.

583
00:52:50,202 --> 00:52:51,603
昆图斯。

583
00:52:50,202 --> 00:52:51,603
Quintus.

584
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:58,043
你只是一个发牢骚的小弱者。

584
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:58,043
You're just a
whiny little weakling.

585
00:52:58,143 --> 00:53:02,815
现在，我要离开你，就像你离开我一样。

585
00:52:58,143 --> 00:53:02,815
Now, I'll leave
you, as you left me.

586
00:53:05,284 --> 00:53:07,387
在我们杀死我们的主人之前，

586
00:53:05,284 --> 00:53:07,387
Before we killed our master,

587
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:10,590
他向我透露了他最黑暗的秘密。

587
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:10,590
he revealed his
darkest secret to me.

588
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:14,427
因为他的妻子拥有一个种马场，

588
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:14,427
Because his wife
owned a stud farm,

589
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,963
他把你当作奴隶藏在她的眼皮底下。

589
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,963
he hid you as a slave
right under her nose.

590
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:19,766
当你在地狱里烤的时候，

590
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:19,766
While you roast in hell,

591
00:53:21,134 --> 00:53:22,302
想想看。

591
00:53:21,134 --> 00:53:22,302
think about this.

592
00:53:25,505 --> 00:53:27,639
他是你的父亲！

592
00:53:25,505 --> 00:53:27,639
He was your father!

593
00:53:33,012 --> 00:53:36,882
没错。贵族的血液流淌在你身上。

593
00:53:33,012 --> 00:53:36,882
That's right. Patrician
blood runs through you.

594
00:54:16,222 --> 00:54:18,992
再见了，小昆图斯。

594
00:54:16,222 --> 00:54:18,992
Farewell, little Quintus.
