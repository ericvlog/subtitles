1
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:08,273
之前在那些即将死去的人身上......

1
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:08,273
Previously on
Those About To Die...

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:13,646
地球上最伟大的城市的人们，让游戏开始吧！

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:13,646
People of the greatest city
on Earth, let the games begin!

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,917
你丈夫打得好，他会赢木剑。

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,917
Your husband fights well,
he will win the wooden sword.

4
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,519
这是关于什么的？

4
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,519
What's this about?

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,489
- 她现在是罗马的财产。-不！请！

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,489
- She is now the property of Rome.
- No! Please!

6
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:23,823
这是怎麽？

6
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:23,823
What is this?

7
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:25,402
我已经注册了 Ludus。

7
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:25,402
I've enrolled myself
in the the Ludus.

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,094
领航员今天下午抵达奥斯蒂亚。

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,094
The navigator arrives
in Ostia this afternoon.

9
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:29,862
杀了他，此时此地。

9
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:29,862
Kill him, here and now.

10
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:34,334
我有一件最重要的事情要送给提图斯皇帝。

10
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:34,334
I have something of the utmost
importance to give to the Emperor Titus.

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,746
今天，我们似乎孤军奋战。

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,746
It seems, today, we fight alone.

12
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:52,118
没有人知道他们会让我们面对什么。一支军队。动物。

12
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:52,118
There's no telling what they'll
pit us against. An army. Animals.

13
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,121
我们将背靠背。

13
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,121
We'll go back to back.

14
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,191
让我们看看我们可以带走多少。

14
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,191
Let's see how many
we can take with us.

15
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:26,218
谢谢。

15
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:26,218
Thank you.

16
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,221
因为你教给我的东西，诺斯曼。

16
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,221
For what you have
taught me, Northman.

17
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,890
不。

17
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,890
No.

18
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,426
谢谢你，我的努米底亚兄弟。

18
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,426
Thank you, my Numidian brother.

19
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,729
今天，我们一起生活，或者一起死去。

19
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,729
Today, we live together,
or we die together.

20
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,264
火与冰。

20
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,264
Fire and ice.

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,338
兄弟，你似乎很激动。

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,338
Brother, you seem agitated.

22
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,677
我唯一担心的是首届奥运会是否完美。

22
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,677
My only concern is that the
Inaugural Games are perfect.

23
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,515
好吧，也许奥斯蒂亚凉爽的空气会让你平静下来。

23
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,515
Well, perhaps the cool
air of Ostia will calm you.

24
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,387
- 奥斯蒂亚？-是的。

24
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,387
- Ostia?
- Yes.

25
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:07,260
在我们完成这一天的游戏后，导航员在那里等着我们。

25
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:07,260
A navigator waits for us there
after we finish this day of games.

26
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:28,348
士兵！去找禁卫军。移动。

26
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:28,348
Soldier! Go get the
Praetorians. Move.

27
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,050
士兵，让大家退后！回来！

27
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,050
Soldier, keep everybody
back! Get back!

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,651
我说回去！

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,651
I said get back!

29
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,788
士兵，让他们远离。我不想让任何人靠近这里，明白吗？

29
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,788
Soldier, keep them away. I don't
want anybody near here, understand?

30
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,355
禁卫军除外。快点！

30
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,355
Except for Praetorians. Move it!

31
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,663
跟我来。

31
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,663
Come with me.

32
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:27,533
拜托，拜托，告诉我你为什么要带她去。

32
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:27,533
Please, please, just tell
me why you are taking her.

33
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,201
这个门口没有女人。

33
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,201
No women at this gate.

34
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,271
不，不，拜托。我是她的母亲。

34
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,271
No, no, please. I'm her mother.

35
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,038
我需要知道这是关于什么的。

35
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,038
I need to know
what this is about.

36
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,441
滚开！

36
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,441
Fuck off!

37
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,975
你怎么敢这样跟我说话？

37
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,975
How dare you
talk to me like this?

38
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,242
走开！

38
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,242
Go away!

39
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,384
- 我是我妈妈，没有她我不会离开。-离开！

39
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,384
- I'm her mother, I won't leave without her.
- Leave!

40
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,213
你不能那样逮捕人！

40
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,213
You can't arrest
people like that!

41
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,418
你们这些混蛋！

41
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,418
You bastards!

42
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:56,696
罗马市民！我们向您介绍...

42
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:56,696
Citizens of Rome!
We present you...

43
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,735
一对战士。

43
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,735
a warrior pair.

44
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,040
-加油！-夸！夸！

44
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,040
- Come on!
- Kwame! Kwame!

45
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,877
我们不是角斗士，而是死在罗马军团士兵的手中。

45
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,877
Instead of gladiators, we are to die
at the hands of Roman legionnaires.

46
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,211
我父亲也是。

46
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,211
As did my father.

47
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:15,648
好。一个战士的死亡。

47
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:15,648
Good. A warrior's death.

48
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,951
两个角斗士背靠背战斗，

48
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,951
Two gladiators having
fought back to back,

49
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:23,255
作为野蛮的阿喀琉斯和感性的帕特洛克罗斯，

49
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:23,255
as savage Achilles,
and sensuous Patroclus,

50
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:26,925
快朋友在生死中联系在一起。

50
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:26,925
fast friends bonded
in life and death.

51
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,894
维果，北方人！

51
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,894
Viggo, the Northman!

52
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,774
还有狮子杀手夸梅！

52
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,774
And Kwame, the Lion Killer!

53
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,613
- 加油夸梅！- 加油夸梅！

53
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,613
- Come on Kwame!
- Come on Kwame!

54
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:50,216
在11场胜利之后，今天，

54
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:50,216
After 11 victories, today,

55
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,451
维果战斗

55
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,451
Viggo fights

56
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,819
伟大的...

56
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,819
the Great...

57
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,891
夸！

57
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,891
Kwame!

58
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,298
无敌弗拉玛的杀手！

58
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,298
Killer of the invincible Flamma!

59
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,101
这两个，最伟大的角斗士，

59
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,101
These two, the
greatest of all gladiators,

60
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,870
将，为了你的快乐，

60
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,870
will, for your pleasure,

61
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,406
现在互相争斗，

61
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,406
fight each other now,

62
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:17,576
至死不渝！

62
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:17,576
to the death!

63
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,742
角斗士。

63
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,742
Gladiators.

64
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,845
聘！

64
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,845
Engage!

65
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,850
夸。要坚强，兄弟，要坚强。

65
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,850
Kwame. Be strong,
brother, be strong.

66
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:57,983
我支持你。

66
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:57,983
I have your back.

67
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,603
来！

67
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,603
Come!

68
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,908
战斗！战斗！

68
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,908
Fight! Fight!

69
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,877
战斗！战斗！

69
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,877
Fight! Fight!

70
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,723
你是个怪物。他们带走了我的女儿！

70
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,723
You're a monster.
They've taken my daughter!

71
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,957
他们把她带到哪里去了？

71
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,957
Where have they taken her?

72
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:41,761
哪里？

72
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:41,761
Where?

73
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,903
我已经付了票！

73
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,903
I've paid my ticket!

74
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,002
来吧，战斗！

74
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,002
Come on, fight!

75
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,507
- 战斗，战斗，战斗！- 战斗，战斗，战斗！

75
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,507
- Fight, fight, fight!
- Fight, fight, fight!

76
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,076
这是娱乐的一部分吗？

76
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,076
This is part of
the entertainment?

77
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,144
我预料到了这一点。

77
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,144
I expected this.

78
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,687
罗马市民们，我向你们介绍......

78
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,687
Citizens of Rome,
I present to you...

79
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,658
朱拉！

79
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,658
Jula!

80
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,665
狮子杀手的小妹妹，夸梅！

80
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,665
Little sister of the
Lion Killer, Kwame!

81
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:21,434
朱拉！

81
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:21,434
Jula!

82
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,737
一个奴隶。罗马的财产。

82
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,737
A slave. The property of Rome.

83
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,709
还有北方人的儿子维果。

83
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,709
And the son of the
Northman, Viggo.

84
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:36,883
七岁，父亲眼中的光芒。

84
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:36,883
Seven years old, and
the light of his father's eye.

85
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,751
不。不。

85
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,751
No. No.

86
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,086
不。不。

86
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,086
No. No.

87
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,725
勇敢的角斗士们，还有什么比这更能鼓励战斗的呢，

87
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,725
What better encouragement
to fight, brave gladiators,

88
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,629
但是为了挽救家人的生命？

88
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,629
but to save the
lives of your family?

89
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,101
谁会死？

89
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,101
Who will die?

90
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,236
谁会活下来？

90
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,236
And who will live?

91
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,750
不。

91
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,750
No.

92
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,653
你设计了这种娱乐活动吗？

92
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,653
Did you devise
this entertainment?

93
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,889
哥哥。

93
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,889
Brother.

94
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,659
这是你的主意吗？

94
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,659
Was this your idea?

95
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,629
-是的。- 哦，好吧，

95
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,629
- Yes.
- Oh, well,

96
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,032
然后女神 Discordia 就住在你里面。

96
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,032
then the goddess
Discordia lives within you.

97
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,036
只有狡猾的头脑才能召唤出这样的事情。

97
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,036
Only a devious mind
could conjure such a thing.

98
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,960
我的朋友，我别无选择，只能杀了你。

98
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,960
My friend, I have no
choice but to kill you.

99
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,663
请原谅我。

99
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,663
Please forgive me.

100
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,000
如果你成功了，就不需要宽恕了。

100
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,000
If you succeed, no
forgiveness is needed.

101
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,802
罪魁祸首将归咎于这些贪婪的狼......

101
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,802
The blame will lie with
these ravening wolves...

102
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,774
罗穆卢斯的私生子。

102
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,774
Bastard children of Romulus.

103
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,708
夸！

103
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,708
Kwame!

104
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,200
嘿，姑娘！那个女人在哪里？

104
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,200
Hey, girl! Where's that woman?

105
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,875
特纳克斯。

105
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,875
Tenax.

106
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,711
他与 Aedile Ludi 合作。我在哪里可以找到他？

106
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,711
He works with the Aedile
Ludi. Where do I find him?

107
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,111
特纳克斯，他在里面的某个地方。

107
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,111
Tenax, he's somewhere inside.

108
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,418
分头行动，找到他，杀了他。

108
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,418
Split up, find him, kill him.

109
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,120
是时候收拾残局了。

109
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,120
It's time to tie up loose ends.

110
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,780
所以我无话可说。

110
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,780
So there is nothing I can say.

111
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,383
你确定要离开吗？

111
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,383
You're certain about leaving?

112
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,181
我很想带你一起去。

112
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,181
I would so love to
take you with me.

113
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,495
但你知道他们对偷马贼做了什么。

113
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,495
But you know what
they do to horse thieves.

114
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,759
艾莉亚，是朱拉！

114
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,759
Elia, it's Jula!

115
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,293
- 他们把她带到了圆形剧场！-什么？

115
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,293
- They've taken her to the amphitheatre!
- What?

116
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,230
他们利用她来强迫她的兄弟与他最好的朋友战斗。

116
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,230
They're using her to force her
brother to fight his best friend.

117
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,102
不！

117
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,102
No!

118
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,359
奇怪的是，看着两个所谓的忠诚朋友......

118
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,359
Strangely compelling to watch
two supposedly loyal friends...

119
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,163
可以称他们为家人，

119
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,163
could call them family,

120
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,033
战斗至死。

120
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,033
fighting to the death.

121
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,104
你不觉得吗，兄弟？

121
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,104
Don't you think, brother?

122
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,015
不要！

122
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,015
Don't!

123
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,335
这里。

123
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,335
Here.

124
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,571
嘿，你不能把你他妈的马留在这里。

124
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,571
Hey, you can't leave
your fucking horse here.

125
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,345
哦！

125
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,345
Oh!

126
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,364
夸！夸！夸！

126
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,364
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

127
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,533
夸！夸！夸！

127
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,533
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

128
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,136
夸！夸！夸！

128
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,136
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

129
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,351
停！停！

129
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,351
Stop! Stop!

130
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,154
那是你的儿子吗？

130
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,154
Is that your son?

131
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,557
那里。

131
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,557
There.

132
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,317
-起床！起床！-起床！

132
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,317
- Get up! Get up!
- Get up!

133
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,590
大！

133
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,590
Da!

134
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,192
维果

134
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,192
Viggo

135
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,661
英勇奋战。

135
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,661
has fought bravely.

136
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,696
让他活下去。

136
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,696
Let him live.

137
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,738
住！

137
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,738
Live!

138
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,443
住！住！住！

138
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,443
Live! Live! Live!

139
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,179
让他活下去

139
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,179
Let him live

140
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,214
再次为你而战！

140
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,214
to fight for you again!

141
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,117
住！住！住！

141
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,117
Live! Live! Live!

142
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,386
给他四分之一！

142
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,386
Give him quarter!

143
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,057
住！住！住！住！

143
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,057
Live! Live! Live! Live!

144
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,795
住！住！住！住！

144
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,795
Live! Live! Live! Live!

145
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,704
我有一个决定要做，兄弟。

145
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,704
I have a decision
to make, brother.

146
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,740
怜悯还是死亡？这是什么？

146
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,740
Mercy or death? What's it to be?

147
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,676
怜悯。

147
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,676
Mercy.

148
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,752
也许不是今天。

148
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,752
Perhaps not today.

149
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,459
-不！-不！

149
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,459
- No!
- No!

150
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,729
-不 不！什么？-什么？

150
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,729
- No, no! What?
- What?

151
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,198
不！

151
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,198
No!

152
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,467
不！

152
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,467
No!

153
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,234
不！

153
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,234
No!

154
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,205
不！

154
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,205
No!

155
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,354
没关系，儿子。

155
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,354
It's all right, son.

156
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,822
没关系。

156
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,822
It's all right.

157
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,426
你将与众神同在，

157
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,426
You will rest with the Gods,

158
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,396
并在我的梦中拜访我。

158
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,396
and visit me in my dreams.

159
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,233
请。请尽你所能

159
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,233
Please. Please do what you can

160
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:56,368
为了让我的儿子活着。

160
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:56,368
to keep my son alive.

161
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,805
我会的。我会的。

161
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,805
I will. I will.

162
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,673
死亡之屋。

162
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,673
The house of death.

163
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,679
我不会再有这个了。

163
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,679
I will have no more of this.

164
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,215
木剑！木剑！

164
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,215
Wooden sword! Wooden sword!

165
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:19,486
木剑！木剑！

165
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:19,486
Wooden sword! Wooden sword!

166
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:23,355
木剑！木剑！

166
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:23,355
Wooden sword! Wooden sword!

167
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,859
木剑！木剑！

167
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,859
Wooden sword! Wooden sword!

168
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,031
木剑！木剑！

168
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,031
Wooden sword! Wooden sword!

169
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,732
哥哥。

169
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,732
Brother.

170
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,237
木剑！木剑！

170
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,237
Wooden sword! Wooden sword!

171
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,539
木剑！木剑！

171
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,539
Wooden sword! Wooden sword!

172
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,789
木剑！木剑！

172
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,789
Wooden sword! Wooden sword!

173
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,840
这些游戏，

173
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,840
These games,

174
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,844
我们的城市，

174
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,844
our city,

175
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,713
我们的帝国，

175
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,713
our empire,

176
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,983
颂扬其最重要的美德。

176
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,983
celebrates its most
important virtue.

177
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,488
武士气概，

177
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,488
Martial valor,

178
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,490
和对罗马的责任。

178
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,490
and duty to Rome.

179
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,728
随着他今天的胜利，

179
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,728
With his victory today,

180
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,565
让这个角斗士

180
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,565
let this gladiator

181
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,134
庆祝自由！

181
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,134
celebrate freedom!

182
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,920
-夸！夸！夸！-夸！夸！夸！

182
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,920
- Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!
- Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

183
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,894
夸！夸！夸！

183
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,894
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

184
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,603
释放她。

184
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,603
Free her.

185
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,921
这个角斗士

185
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,921
This gladiator

186
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,025
已经赢得了权利

186
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,025
has earned the right

187
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,060
活在他的自由中

187
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,060
to live in his freedom

188
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,030
然而，他认为合适！

188
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,030
however he sees fit!

189
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:49,702
让他的姿态

189
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:49,702
Let his gesture

190
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,872
留！

190
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,872
stay!

191
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,894
拿去吧。

191
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,894
Take it.

192
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,665
拿去吧。

192
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,665
Take it.

193
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,011
你现在是自由的。

193
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,011
You are free now.

194
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,580
你是自由的。

194
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,580
You are free.

195
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,584
你是自由的。

195
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,584
You are free.

196
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,252
朱拉。

196
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,252
Jula.

197
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:41,855
你没事吧？

197
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:41,855
Are you okay?

198
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,592
谢谢。

198
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,592
Thank you.

199
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,961
去。

199
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,961
Go.

200
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:49,695
来。

200
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:49,695
Come.

201
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,930
谢谢。

201
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,930
Thank you.

202
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,866
夸！夸！夸！

202
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,866
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

203
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:16,623
带她去特纳克斯的公寓，在那里等我。

203
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:16,623
Take her to Tenax's
apartment and wait for me there.

204
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:18,057
我们得谈谈。

204
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:18,057
We need to talk.

205
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,993
去。去。

205
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,993
Go. Go.

206
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,203
夸！夸！夸！

206
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,203
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

207
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:35,342
夸！夸！夸！

207
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:35,342
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

208
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:39,211
夸！夸！夸！

208
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:39,211
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

209
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,147
夸！夸！夸！

209
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,147
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

210
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,170
怎么了？

210
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,170
What's wrong?

211
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,174
我生了你的孩子。

211
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,174
I bear your child.

212
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:15,582
你为什么不告诉我？

212
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:15,582
Why didn't you tell me?

213
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,784
因为我害怕它会让你离开。

213
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,784
Because I was afraid it
would make you leave.

214
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,653
朱拉。

214
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,653
Jula.

215
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:23,123
我哪儿也不去。

215
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:23,123
I'm not going anywhere.

216
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,539
主啊，我们护送奥斯蒂亚的队伍已经上马了。

216
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,539
Our escort to Ostia has
mounted already, Lord.

217
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,242
很好。哥哥

217
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,242
Very well. Brother,

218
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,179
我们在奥斯蒂亚有业务要处理。

218
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,179
we have business
in Ostia to attend to.

219
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
我想如果我留下来是最好的。

219
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
I think it would
be best if I stayed.

220
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,983
你的皇帝

220
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,983
Your Emperor

221
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:54,086
命令它。

221
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:54,086
commands it.

222
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,732
诺斯曼的儿子，杀了他。

222
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,732
The Northman's son, kill him.

223
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:13,205
你听到了。杀了他。

223
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:13,205
You heard me. Kill him.

224
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:16,776
杀了那个男孩！

224
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:16,776
Kill the boy!

225
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,013
阿伦！不！不！

225
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,013
Ahren! No! No!

226
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,051
不！

226
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,051
No!

227
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,152
不！

227
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,152
No!

228
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:32,392
不！不！不！

228
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:32,392
No! No! No!

229
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:49,909
哥哥！

229
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:49,909
Brother!

230
00:26:58,151 --> 00:26:59,219
有了这个，

230
00:26:58,151 --> 00:26:59,219
And with this,

231
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:03,155
首届运动会的第一天闭幕。

231
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:03,155
the first day of the
Inaugural Games closes.

232
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,563
这是谁干的？

232
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,563
Who did this?

233
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,298
我们不知道，凯撒。

233
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,298
We don't know, Caesar.

234
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,665
没有人看到发生了什么。

234
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,665
Nobody saw what happened.

235
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,167
这是你的杰作。

235
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,167
This is your handiwork.

236
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,368
不。

236
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,368
No.

237
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,972
带她去皇宫。

237
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,972
Take her to the palace.

238
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:56,076
是的，我的主人。你听到了。

238
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:56,076
Yes, my lord. You heard him.

239
00:27:56,576 --> 00:27:57,977
到奥斯蒂亚。

239
00:27:56,576 --> 00:27:57,977
To Ostia.

240
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,492
你这个肮脏的，背叛的狗屎。

240
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,492
You filthy, betraying shit.

241
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,028
没有背叛。

241
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,028
There is no betrayal.

242
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,131
只有生存。

242
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,131
Only survival.

243
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,201
你是个赌徒。你只是输了。

243
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,201
You're a gambler.
You simply lost.

244
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,037
图密善将死在他哥哥的手里，

244
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,037
Domitian will die by
his brother's hand,

245
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,405
你会死在我的剑下。

245
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,405
you will die by my sword here.

246
00:28:59,506 --> 00:29:02,608
我们的小安排将和你一起死去。

246
00:28:59,506 --> 00:29:02,608
And our little arrangement
will die along with you.

247
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:04,510
生存。

247
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:04,510
Survival.

248
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,080
还有 1000 万塞斯特斯。

248
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,080
And the 10 million sesterces.

249
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,917
我们都有开支。

249
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,917
We all have expenses.

250
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,125
特纳克斯！

250
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,125
Tenax!

251
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:54,119
永远不要让士兵与街头霸王对抗。

251
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:54,119
Never pit a soldier
against a street fighter.

252
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,384
你背叛了我。

252
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,384
You betrayed me.

253
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,221
你撒谎了。

253
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,221
You lied.

254
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,824
也许被背叛了，但我从未对你撒谎。

254
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,824
Betrayed, perhaps,
but I never lied to you.

255
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,659
我杀了一个人，付出的代价要少得多。

255
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,659
I've killed a man for far less.

256
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:38,530
我相信你有。

256
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:38,530
I'm sure you have.

257
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:03,721
拥抱墙壁。

257
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:03,721
Hug the wall.

258
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:24,477
我稍后会和你打交道。

258
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:24,477
I'll deal with you later.

259
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,628
大家，快回来！

259
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,628
Everyone, get back!

260
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,798
不 不！不，不，不，不，不！

260
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,798
No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

261
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,666
你做了什么？

261
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,666
What have you done?

262
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:49,501
我不得不这样做。

262
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:49,501
I had to.

263
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,306
我不明白你。

263
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,306
I don't understand you.

264
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:54,773
你从来没有这样做过。

264
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:54,773
You never did.

265
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,068
马尼利乌斯说他要付多少钱？

265
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,068
How much did Manilius
say he was going to pay?

266
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,505
我们有命令要杀了你。

266
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,505
We have orders to kill you.

267
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:27,007
多少？

267
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:27,007
How much?

268
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:29,409
十万，每个。

268
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:29,409
A hundred thousand, each.

269
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,511
我付给他1000万。

269
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,511
I paid him 10 million.

270
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:37,282
跟我来，你可以分享所有这些。

270
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:37,282
Come with me, and
you can share all of that.

271
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:40,818
木已成舟。

271
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:40,818
The die is cast.

272
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:44,057
嘿！

272
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:44,057
Hey!

273
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:49,621
我会把它引开。保护母亲。

273
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:49,621
I will lure it away.
Protect mother.

274
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,358
来！

274
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,358
Come!

275
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:10,496
我们是一体的，

275
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:10,496
We are one,

276
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:13,632
你和我...

276
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:13,632
you and I...

277
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:18,637
来自阿佩德马克的孩子们。

277
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:18,637
children from Apedemak.

278
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,775
让我们诅咒这些罗马人，

278
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,775
Let us curse these Romans,

279
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:25,512
让他们受苦！

279
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:25,512
and make them suffer!

280
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,034
你在科西嘉岛附近停泊了多长时间？

280
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,034
How long did you lay
at anchor off Corsica?

281
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:50,769
三周。

281
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:50,769
Three weeks.

282
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:53,039
听谁的命令？

282
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:53,039
Upon whose order?

283
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:59,878
如果你说实话，你的家人将受到保护。

283
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:59,878
Your family will be
protected if you tell the truth.

284
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:07,753
图密善·弗拉维安努斯。

284
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:07,753
Domitian Flavianus.

285
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,724
我看到了他的命令并遵循了他们。

285
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,724
I saw his orders
and followed them.

286
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:15,862
把他带出去。

286
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:15,862
Get him out of here.

287
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:27,907
现在我是傻瓜的两倍。

287
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:27,907
Now I am twice the fool.

288
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,344
首先，信任你。

288
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,344
Firstly, for trusting you.

289
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,349
其次，在这种信任消失之后，

289
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,349
Secondly, after
that trust had gone,

290
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:39,786
因为以为我可以控制你。

290
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:39,786
for thinking I
could control you.

291
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:43,021
他应。

291
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:43,021
He should die.

292
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:44,990
此时此地。

292
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:44,990
Here and now.

293
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:46,992
不，不，他会的。

293
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:46,992
No, no, he will.

294
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,961
但。。。

294
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,961
But...

295
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:51,463
当众。

295
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:51,463
in public.

296
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:57,003
在参议院被定罪后，将他从塔佩岩中扔出去。

296
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:57,003
Throw him from the Tarpeian
Rock after conviction in the Senate.

297
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:14,054
皇帝，滚回去，在我身后！

297
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:14,054
Emperor, get back, behind me!

298
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,739
请原谅我，提图斯勋爵。

298
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,739
Forgive me, Lord Titus.

299
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:08,007
我辜负了你。

299
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:08,007
I failed you.

300
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:17,050
哦，兄弟，命运玩弄着生命的线索。

300
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:17,050
Oh, brother, the fates
toy with the threads of life.

301
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:19,018
把他绑起来。

301
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:19,018
Bind him.

302
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:24,023
我想，是时候把那根脏线剪短了。

302
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:24,023
Time to cut that soiled
thread short, I think.

303
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:27,059
- 你认为暗杀会救你吗？- 嗯，这是一个开始。

303
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:27,059
- You think assassination will save you?
- Well, it's a start.

304
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,163
你扮演莫塔，你会，亲手杀了我吗？

304
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,163
You play Morta, will
you, and kill me yourself?

305
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,262
我想我可以。

305
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,262
I thought I might.

306
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:33,032
哥哥。

306
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:33,032
Brother.

307
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:35,635
弟弟

307
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:35,635
Little brother,

308
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:38,605
隐藏你的恐惧，隐藏你的眼泪。

308
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:38,605
hide your fears
and hide your tears.

309
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,039
你还记得我跟你说过的话吗？

309
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,039
Do you remember what I told you?

310
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,273
你不是士兵。

310
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,273
You are no soldier.

311
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:45,644
那一刻你无法杀死任何人。

311
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:45,644
That in the moment you'd
be unable to kill anybody.

312
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:46,956
是什么让你认为你现在能做到？

312
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:46,956
What makes you
think you can do it now?

313
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,516
- 你低估了我。- 我呢？

313
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,516
- You underestimate me.
- Do I?

314
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:57,190
无论他说什么，他都会付给你，我会付给你十倍的钱。

314
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:57,190
Whatever he said he'll pay you,
I'll pay you ten times as much.

315
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,925
- 他在撒谎。- 我是吗？

315
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,925
- He's lying.
- Am I?

316
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,831
我向土星发誓，你将拥有你想要的一切。

316
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,831
I swear by Saturn,
you'll have all you desire.

317
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:06,900
什么。这是你的。

317
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:06,900
Anything. It's yours.

318
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,704
无论他付给你什么，与此相比都算不了什么。

318
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,704
Whatever he paid you, it will
be nothing compared to this.

319
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,438
不要听他的话。

319
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:12,438
Do not listen to him.

320
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:14,541
他不能见证这种邪恶。

320
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:14,541
He cannot have
witnesses to this evil.

321
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,242
-闭嘴！-哦不。

321
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,242
- Shut up!
- Oh, no.

322
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,478
听我说！

322
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,478
Listen to me!

323
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:19,913
陛下将军！

323
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:19,913
Your General!

324
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:21,914
陛下！

324
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:21,914
Your Emperor!

325
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,351
你们这些傻瓜，难道不明白吗？

325
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,351
You fools, do you
not understand?

326
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:26,052
他会杀了你们所有人。

326
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:26,052
He will kill you all.

327
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:27,152
跪。

327
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:27,152
Kneel.

328
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:33,992
跪。

328
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:33,992
Kneel.

329
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:37,163
跪！

329
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:37,163
Kneel!

330
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,137
我哥哥只是个孩子。

330
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,137
My brother is just a child.

331
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:49,476
他只是一个软弱、任性的小孩。

331
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:49,476
He's just a weak,
petulant little child.

332
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:50,976
所以考虑一下。

332
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:50,976
So consider this.

333
00:41:51,945 --> 00:41:53,813
谁更有可能让你活下去？

333
00:41:51,945 --> 00:41:53,813
Who's more likely
to let you live?

334
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:56,849
我和你一样是一名士兵。

334
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:56,849
I'm a soldier just like you.

335
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:59,052
我是一个坚强的人，但我是一个正义的人。

335
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:59,052
I'm a hard man,
but I'm a just man.

336
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:01,221
我是一个光荣的人。看看他。

336
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:01,221
And I'm an honorable
man. Look at him.

337
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:03,422
看看他！

337
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:03,422
Look at him!

338
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:05,257
是恐惧驱使着他。

338
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:05,257
It's the fear that drives him.

339
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,628
你更信任谁？这种恐惧就是你的死亡！

339
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,628
Who can you trust more?
That fear will be your death!

340
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:10,864
闭嘴。不要听他的话。

340
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:10,864
Shut up. Do not listen to him.

341
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:14,233
我哥哥说得对，是的，不要听我的。

341
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:14,233
My brother's right,
yes, do not listen to me.

342
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:17,737
倾听你的心声。

342
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:17,737
Listen to your heart.

343
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:19,338
想想你的家人。

343
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:19,338
Think of your families.

344
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,141
想想你所爱的人。

344
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,141
Think of those you love.

345
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:24,610
最重要的是，

345
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:24,610
And above all else,

346
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,880
想想我们心爱的罗马！

346
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,880
think of our beloved Rome!

347
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:30,282
谁是这座城市的伟大守护者？

347
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:30,282
Who is the greater
guardian of this city?

348
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,052
我？

348
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,052
Me?

349
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:36,989
或者这个卑鄙的，

349
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:36,989
Or this vile,

350
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:39,525
绝望，软弱，

350
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:39,525
desperate, weak,

351
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:41,226
卑鄙的蠕虫？

351
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:41,226
despicable worm?

352
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,175
看，兄弟。

352
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,175
Look, brother.

353
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,282
苦涩的眼泪。

353
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,282
Bitter tears.

354
00:43:02,382 --> 00:43:04,284
你能尝尝吗？

354
00:43:02,382 --> 00:43:04,284
Can you taste them?

355
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:08,253
我从你手中遭受的羞辱和残酷。

355
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:08,253
From the humiliation and
cruelty I suffered at your hand.

356
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,989
好吧，现在你可以窒息了。

356
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,989
Well, now you can choke on them.

357
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:15,961
看，兄弟，命运来了。

357
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:15,961
Look, brother,
here come the fates.

358
00:43:17,664 --> 00:43:19,132
剪 断。

358
00:43:17,664 --> 00:43:19,132
Snip.

359
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:20,233
剪 断。

359
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:20,233
Snip.

360
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,235
剪 断。

360
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,235
Snip.

361
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:42,956
干的好。

361
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:42,956
Well done.

362
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:46,159
我活着就是为了服侍你。

362
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:46,159
I live to serve you.

363
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:50,697
凯撒。

363
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:50,697
Caesar.

364
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:14,387
继续好好服侍我，我就让你活下去。

364
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:14,387
Continue to serve me
well, and I will let you live.

365
00:44:15,588 --> 00:44:16,956
现在离开。

365
00:44:15,588 --> 00:44:16,956
Now leave.

366
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:19,259
我会在四只眼睛下和 Tenax 说话。

366
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:19,259
I'll speak to Tenax
under four eyes.

367
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,737
父亲，现在见到我了吗？

367
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,737
See me now, Father?

368
00:44:33,106 --> 00:44:35,074
我是你应该选择的统治者。

368
00:44:33,106 --> 00:44:35,074
I am the ruler you
should've chosen.

369
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:43,382
你最伟大的表演。他凸出的眼睛。

369
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:43,382
Your greatest show
yet. His bulging eyes.

370
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:46,885
几乎和看叛徒被鳄鱼吃掉一样有趣。

370
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:46,885
Almost as entertaining as watching
traitors be eaten by crocodiles.

371
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:50,724
您将成为一名出色的 Aedile Ludi。

371
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:50,724
You will make an
excellent Aedile Ludi.

372
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:52,726
你尊重我。

372
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:52,726
You honor me.

373
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:57,030
现在清理这个烂摊子。

373
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:57,030
Now clean up this mess.

374
00:44:58,331 --> 00:45:00,300
我哥哥死于自然原因。

374
00:44:58,331 --> 00:45:00,300
My brother died
of natural causes.

375
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,771
被变质的鱼什么的毒死了。

375
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,771
Poisoned by spoiled
fish or something.

376
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:15,748
勇往直前。让参议院开会。

376
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:15,748
Ride ahead. Have
the Senate assemble.

377
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,208
我的兄弟

377
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,208
My brother

378
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:50,777
死了。

378
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:50,777
is dead.

379
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,414
有人会说他被杀了。

379
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,414
Some will say he was killed.

380
00:46:55,347 --> 00:46:56,548
但那是谎言。

380
00:46:55,347 --> 00:46:56,548
But that is a lie.

381
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:02,956
我听说我哥哥答应了一部分收入

381
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:02,956
I have heard my brother has
promised a portion of the income

382
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:05,891
从我们的弗拉维安圆形剧场到四个...

382
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:05,891
from our Flavian Amphitheatre
to be given to the four...

383
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,561
不。

383
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,561
No.

384
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:11,297
五大派系。

384
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:11,297
The five factions.

385
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:16,202
这种安排已经不复存在了。

385
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:16,202
This arrangement is no more.

386
00:47:18,704 --> 00:47:24,309
弗拉维安圆形剧场属于罗马人民。

386
00:47:18,704 --> 00:47:24,309
The Flavian Amphitheatre
belongs to the people of Rome.

387
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,293
为了证实我哥哥死于自然原因，

387
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,293
To confirm my brother
died of natural causes,

388
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:42,494
他的尸体将被带到参议院，

388
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:42,494
his body will be brought
here to the Senate,

389
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:45,398
你们每个人都会看到没有标记的地方

389
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:45,398
where each of you will
see there is not a mark

390
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,467
在他身上。

390
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,467
on him.

391
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:50,369
有人告诉我，我哥哥死于糟糕的食物。

391
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:50,369
I have been told my
brother died from bad food.

392
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,572
一场悲剧。

392
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,572
A tragedy.

393
00:47:52,672 --> 00:47:57,242
有些人认为我不适合当皇帝。

393
00:47:52,672 --> 00:47:57,242
There are some who think
me ill-suited to be Emperor.

394
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,047
事实上

394
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,047
Indeed,

395
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:05,452
你们中有些人认为自己比我更适合担任铜珠宝座。

395
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:05,452
there are some of you who think yourselves
better suited for the curule throne than I.

396
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:10,023
摒弃这种观念。

396
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:10,023
Disabuse this notion.

397
00:48:11,657 --> 00:48:12,657
现在。

397
00:48:11,657 --> 00:48:12,657
Now.

398
00:48:15,027 --> 00:48:16,996
愿你的领事马苏斯的命运

398
00:48:15,027 --> 00:48:16,996
May the fate of
your Consul Marsus

399
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:19,965
以及他在我们弗拉维安圆形剧场的同谋

399
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:19,965
and his co-conspirators
in our Flavian amphitheatre

400
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:24,336
告诉这样的尝试是多么徒劳。

400
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:24,336
tell of how futile
such attempts are.

401
00:48:32,945 --> 00:48:34,280
现在，起来

401
00:48:32,945 --> 00:48:34,280
Now, rise

402
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,650
赞美你的新皇帝。

402
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,650
to acclaim your new Emperor.

403
00:49:28,934 --> 00:49:31,704
凯撒万岁。

403
00:49:28,934 --> 00:49:31,704
Hail Caesar.

404
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:45,251
订单？

404
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:45,251
Orders?

405
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:47,619
保护军械库、国库和宫殿。

405
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:47,619
Secure the armory, the
treasury, and the palace.

406
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:49,688
通知军团。

406
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:49,688
Inform the legions.

407
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,391
给你的警卫细节？

407
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,391
A detail of guards for you?

408
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:55,461
在远处。我希望一个人呆着。

408
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:55,461
At a distance. I
wish to be alone.

409
00:49:55,561 --> 00:49:56,695
是的，我的主人。

409
00:49:55,561 --> 00:49:56,695
Yes, my lord.

410
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,186
你将如何供养她？

410
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,186
How will you provide for her?

411
00:50:20,286 --> 00:50:21,788
我正在为蓝调而骑。

411
00:50:20,286 --> 00:50:21,788
I am riding for the blues.

412
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:24,090
我现在是他们的领头车夫。

412
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:24,090
I am their lead charioteer now.

413
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,659
嗯。当你被杀时？

413
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,659
Hmm. And when you are killed?

414
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,494
我们车手为此有一个俱乐部。

414
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,494
We drivers have a club for that.

415
00:50:29,128 --> 00:50:30,597
我们节省...

415
00:50:29,128 --> 00:50:30,597
We save for...

416
00:50:32,065 --> 00:50:33,632
好吧，以防万一。

416
00:50:32,065 --> 00:50:33,632
Well, just in case.

417
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:38,771
你爱他吗？

417
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:38,771
Do you love him?

418
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:44,376
是的。

418
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:44,376
Yes.

419
00:50:45,277 --> 00:50:46,813
我愿意，母亲。

419
00:50:45,277 --> 00:50:46,813
I do, Mother.

420
00:50:47,981 --> 00:50:49,815
爱。

420
00:50:47,981 --> 00:50:49,815
Love.

421
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,751
婚姻基础薄弱。

421
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,751
A weak basis for marriage.

422
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:55,355
但现在可以了。

422
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:55,355
But it will do for now.

423
00:50:55,454 --> 00:50:56,722
谢谢。

423
00:50:55,454 --> 00:50:56,722
Thank you.

424
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:03,697
Tenax希望你来。

424
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:03,697
Tenax wants you to come.

425
00:51:09,668 --> 00:51:13,907
好好照顾她，否则你会回答我的。

425
00:51:09,668 --> 00:51:13,907
Take good care of her,
or you will answer to me.

426
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:15,708
还有努米底亚的众神。

426
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:15,708
And to the Gods of Numidia.

427
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:17,804
你的新家？

427
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:17,804
Your new home?

428
00:52:18,871 --> 00:52:20,340
天蝎座没有使用它。

428
00:52:18,871 --> 00:52:20,340
Scorpus isn't using it.

429
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,208
无论如何，他讨厌它。

429
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,208
Anyway, he hated it.

430
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:26,311
他更喜欢妓院。

430
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:26,311
He preferred brothels.

431
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:33,353
图密善，我们的新皇帝，让我成为埃迪尔·卢迪。

431
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:33,353
Domitian, our new emperor,
has made me Aedile Ludi.

432
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:36,356
你知道这意味着什么吗？

432
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:36,356
You know what that means?

433
00:52:38,157 --> 00:52:40,260
尤利乌斯·凯撒本人

433
00:52:38,157 --> 00:52:40,260
Julius Caesar himself

434
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,929
在他崛起期间担任 Aedile。

434
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,929
served as Aedile
during his rise.

435
00:52:43,262 --> 00:52:44,931
当之无愧的奖品。

435
00:52:43,262 --> 00:52:44,931
A deserved prize.

436
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:49,202
为了让新皇帝登上王位。

436
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:49,202
For putting a new
emperor on the throne.

437
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,936
现在我们都知道了，

437
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,936
Now we both know that,

438
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:52,871
但不能大声说出来。

438
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:52,871
but it's not to
be said out loud.

439
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,775
尤其是对图密善。

439
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,775
Especially to Domitian.

440
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:04,918
你明白我需要杀了你，不是吗？

440
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:04,918
You understand that I
need to kill you, don't you?

441
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:10,824
我知道你相信这一点。

441
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:10,824
I understand that
you believe that.

442
00:53:14,393 --> 00:53:16,663
那么，这并不奇怪。

442
00:53:14,393 --> 00:53:16,663
No surprise, then.

443
00:53:16,762 --> 00:53:19,865
我希望你能试着讨价还价。

443
00:53:16,762 --> 00:53:19,865
I expected you to try and
bargain your way out of this.

444
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:24,570
只有靠着愚蠢的运气，我才能活着。

444
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:24,570
It's only through
dumb luck that I'm alive.

445
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,672
如果那卷轴传到提多那里，

445
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,672
Had that scroll reached Titus,

446
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:28,907
我会死的，图密善也会死。

446
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:28,907
I would be dead,
and Domitian as well.

447
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:31,110
那么你应该感谢你的罗马神，福尔图纳。

447
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:31,110
Then you should thank
your Roman god, Fortuna.

448
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,344
我愿意。

448
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,344
I do.

449
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:39,818
我不乐意杀了你。

449
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:39,818
I take no pleasure
in killing you.

450
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,389
但你让我别无选择。

450
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,389
But you've given me no choice.

451
00:53:45,324 --> 00:53:46,626
我背叛了你。

451
00:53:45,324 --> 00:53:46,626
I betrayed you.

452
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:50,630
但是我曾经骗过你吗？

452
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:50,630
But did I ever lie to you?

453
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:57,336
你来自阴沟，

453
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:57,336
You are from the gutter,

454
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:00,572
你的钱，

454
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:00,572
your money,

455
00:54:00,673 --> 00:54:04,577
你的赌注，你的盟友，

455
00:54:00,673 --> 00:54:04,577
your betting, your allies,

456
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:09,114
你所有的效忠，你的存在，

456
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:09,114
all your allegiances,
your very being,

457
00:54:09,215 --> 00:54:10,916
下水道都散发着臭味。

457
00:54:09,215 --> 00:54:10,916
all reek of the sewer.

458
00:54:12,818 --> 00:54:16,021
但你现在住在埃斯奎林山上。

458
00:54:12,818 --> 00:54:16,021
But you live on the
Esquiline Hill now.

459
00:54:16,121 --> 00:54:20,360
你需要一个诚实的人来管理你留下的东西。

459
00:54:16,121 --> 00:54:20,360
You need someone honest to
manage what you leave behind.

460
00:54:21,393 --> 00:54:23,463
没有无穷无尽的资金流，

460
00:54:21,393 --> 00:54:23,463
Without an endless
flow of money,

461
00:54:23,563 --> 00:54:25,798
这一切都会分崩离析，

461
00:54:23,563 --> 00:54:25,798
all this will fall apart,

462
00:54:25,898 --> 00:54:29,068
参议员们会笑着滚动

462
00:54:25,898 --> 00:54:29,068
and the senators
will roll with laughter

463
00:54:29,168 --> 00:54:31,070
当他们把你踢回排水沟时。

463
00:54:29,168 --> 00:54:31,070
as they kick you
back to the gutter.

464
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:34,074
我为什么要相信你？

464
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:34,074
Why should I trust you?

465
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:38,811
还有谁？

465
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:38,811
Who else?

466
00:54:44,516 --> 00:54:46,318
为了我的孩子，

466
00:54:44,516 --> 00:54:46,318
For my children,

467
00:54:46,418 --> 00:54:48,387
我一会儿就会背叛你。

467
00:54:46,418 --> 00:54:48,387
I will betray you in a second.

468
00:54:54,728 --> 00:54:58,331
但除此之外，我永远不会对你撒谎。

468
00:54:54,728 --> 00:54:58,331
But beyond that, I
will never lie to you.

469
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:01,099
我从来没有。

469
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:01,099
I never have.

470
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:05,838
还有谁能为你提供？

470
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:05,838
Who else can offer you that?

471
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:12,512
你吓死我了。

471
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:12,512
You terrify me.

472
00:55:20,052 --> 00:55:21,052
好。

472
00:55:20,052 --> 00:55:21,052
Good.

473
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:25,525
你知道在哪里可以找到我。

473
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:25,525
You know where to find me.

474
00:55:49,715 --> 00:55:51,451
我杀了一个皇帝，

474
00:55:49,715 --> 00:55:51,451
I killed an emperor,

475
00:55:52,818 --> 00:55:55,922
但回报是成为 Aedile Ludi。

475
00:55:52,818 --> 00:55:55,922
but the reward was
to become Aedile Ludi.

476
00:55:57,389 --> 00:56:00,393
这只是我旅程的第一步。

476
00:55:57,389 --> 00:56:00,393
This was only a first
step in my journey.

477
00:56:04,898 --> 00:56:07,567
在某个时候，我将前往锡拉丘兹，

477
00:56:04,898 --> 00:56:07,567
At some point, I will
travel to Syracuse,

478
00:56:08,835 --> 00:56:11,403
看看我是否真的是贵族，

478
00:56:08,835 --> 00:56:11,403
to find out if I'm
truly a patrician,

479
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:13,806
正如乌尔苏斯告诉我的那样。

479
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:13,806
as Ursus told me.

480
00:56:15,574 --> 00:56:18,110
也许这将伴随着一些我会继承的土地。

480
00:56:15,574 --> 00:56:18,110
Maybe this will come with
some land I would inherit.

481
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:21,114
我们拭目以待。

481
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:21,114
We will see.

482
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:27,186
我需要提防图密善。

482
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:27,186
I need to be
watchful of Domitian.

483
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:32,958
他就像一个任性的孩子。

483
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:32,958
He's like a petulant child.

484
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:36,161
残酷

484
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:36,161
Cruel,

485
00:56:37,163 --> 00:56:40,599
以及一个不可预测的阴谋家和杀手。

485
00:56:37,163 --> 00:56:40,599
and an unpredictable
schemer and killer.

486
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:45,304
希望

486
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:45,304
Hopefully,

487
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:47,606
我将能够控制他。

487
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:47,606
I will be able to control him.

488
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:16,568
让游戏开始吧。

488
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:16,568
Let the games begin.
