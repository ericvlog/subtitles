1
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:32,091
不，求求你，发发慈悲吧。

1
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:32,091
No, please, please,
please, have mercy.

2
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,992
现在说什么都晚了。

2
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,992
It's too late for mercy now.

3
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,861
- 我们警告过你。- 我保证，

3
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,861
- We warned you.
- I promise,

4
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,996
只要你饶了我一命，求你了

4
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,996
if you just spare
my life, please.

5
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,299
一开始你说你毁了，

5
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,299
First, you say you're ruined,

6
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,359
现在你却想用钱摆平这事

6
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,359
and now you're trying to
buy your way out of this?

7
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,644
你这个肮脏的骗子！

7
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,644
You filthy liar!

8
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,349
你让我恶心。

8
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,349
You disgust me.

9
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,719
不，不，Tenax，我会给你钱的。

9
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,719
No, no, Tenax, I'll
get you your money.

10
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,022
- 干掉他- 不，不，不。

10
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,022
- Finish him.
- No, no, no.

11
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,289
- 拿走他的金子- 不，不，不！

11
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,289
- Take his gold.
- No, no, no!

12
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,332
罗马，曾经是文明的灯塔，

12
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,332
Rome, once the
beacon of civilization,

13
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:16,635
现在是一个腐败和腐朽的大水池。

13
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:16,635
is now a cesspool of
corruption and decay.

14
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,772
它的公民只关心两件事。

14
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,772
Its citizens are only
interested in two things.

15
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:22,542
面包和游戏

15
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:22,542
Bread and games.

16
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:26,746
他们叫我Tenax但那不是我的真实的名字

16
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:26,746
They call me Tenax, but
that's not my real name.

17
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,082
在罗马，生命毫无价值。

17
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,082
Life is of little value in Rome.

18
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:31,484
住在垃圾堆里，

18
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:31,484
Living in the muck,

19
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,319
在富人和权贵的阴影下

19
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,319
in the shadow of
the rich and powerful.

20
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:38,591
我在马克西姆斯马戏团的底层长大

20
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:38,591
I grew up in the underbelly
of the Circus Maximus.

21
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:43,096
总是饿着肚子，为食物而战。

21
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:43,096
Always hungry,
fighting for food.

22
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,899
但野心和努力让我成为了

22
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,899
But ambition and hard
work made me the owner

23
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:48,210
全罗马最大、最赚钱的博彩酒馆的老板。

23
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:48,210
of the biggest and most profitable
betting tavern in all of Rome.

24
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,602
在整个罗马。

24
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,602
In all of Rome.

25
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,704
我们做得怎么样？

25
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,704
How did we do?

26
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,771
刚刚超过8,000第纳尔。

26
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,771
Just over 8,000 Denarii.

27
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,740
- 这一批呢- 珠宝送给西班牙人。

27
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,740
- And this lot?
- Jewelry to the Spaniard.

28
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,841
把剩下的装起来。

28
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,841
Bag the rest.

29
00:02:57,776 --> 00:03:00,212
如果你想在我的酒馆下注，

29
00:02:57,776 --> 00:03:00,212
If you want to place
a bet in my tavern,

30
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,014
有四个赛马队

30
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,014
there are four
horse racing teams

31
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,515
你可以把你的钱，

31
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,515
you can put your money on,

32
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:08,121
绿色派、白色派、红色派和蓝色派。

32
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:08,121
the Green, White,
Red and Blue Factions.

33
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,855
驾！

33
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,855
Hyah!

34
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:12,459
他们的股份都被拥有了几百年

34
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:12,459
Their shares have all been
owned for hundreds of years

35
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,961
由罗马的贵族和元老院

35
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,961
by the nobility and
senators of Rome,

36
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,829
这给了他们难以想象的财富。

36
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,829
which gives them
unimaginable wealth.

37
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,734
但很快，

37
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,734
But soon,

38
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,737
这一切都将改变

38
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,737
all of this is about to change.

39
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:30,776
喂！这个还活着

39
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:30,776
Oi! This one's still alive.

40
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,381
- 过去的储蓄。- 不知道

40
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,381
- Past saving.
- Don't.

41
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,484
结束这一切，我求你。

41
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,484
End this, I beg you.

42
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:38,518
仁慈？

42
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:38,518
Mercy?

43
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:40,819
活着的比死了的更有价值。

43
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:40,819
Live ones are worth
more than dead.

44
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:45,324
仁慈是没有价值的。

44
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:45,324
No value in mercy.

45
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,293
当我时间允许的时候，

45
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,293
When my time allows,

46
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,396
我教孩子们他们需要知道的...

46
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,396
I teach the kids what
they need to know...

47
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,331
卡波，今天的货不错。

47
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,331
Carpo, good load today.

48
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,334
一些我不得不用艰苦的方式学习的东西。

48
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,334
Things that I had to
learn the hard way.

49
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,935
三十塞斯特斯买马。

49
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,935
Thirty sesterces for the horse.

50
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,103
十块给男人。

50
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,103
Ten for the man.

51
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,570
这个还活着

51
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,570
This one's still alive.

52
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,007
- 二十- 点三十分.

52
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,007
- Twenty.
- Thirty.

53
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,641
- 25岁- 完了

53
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,641
- Twenty-five.
- Done.

54
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,046
嘿，听着，伙计们，不管是死是活，

54
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,046
Hey, listen, men, dead or alive,

55
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,816
还是比马肉还不值

55
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,816
it's still worth less
than horse meat.

56
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:13,385
罗马皇帝尼禄结束了自己悲惨的生命后，

56
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:13,385
After Rome's Emperor Nero
took his own pathetic life,

57
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:15,487
一场血腥的内战随之而来。

57
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:15,487
a bloody civil war followed.

58
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:19,425
这一年被称为“四帝之年”。

58
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:19,425
This was called The
Year of the Four Emperors.

59
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,293
四位将军想成为

59
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,293
Four generals wanted to become

60
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,862
强大罗马帝国的统治者

60
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,862
ruler of the mighty
Roman Empire.

61
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,036
最后一个站着的人

61
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,036
The last one standing

62
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,206
是弗拉维乌斯·维斯帕西亚努斯将军

62
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,206
was General Flavius Vespasianus.

63
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,209
他的军队拥立他为皇帝后，

63
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,209
After his army had
made him emperor,

64
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,310
他重建了这座城市，

64
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,310
he rebuilt the city
and began at its center

65
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,081
建造一个新的巨型体育竞技场

65
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,081
to erect a new,
giant sports arena

66
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,581
安抚暴民

66
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,581
to appease the mob.

67
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,685
弗拉维安圆形剧场

67
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,685
The Flavian Amphitheatre.

68
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,057
沿着这里走...

68
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,057
Moving along here and...

69
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:54,060
维斯帕先皇帝出身卑微

69
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:54,060
Emperor Vespasian had
come from a lowly family

70
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,463
有两个儿子。

70
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,463
of mule breeders
and had two sons.

71
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:00,567
最年长的提图斯已经成为一位著名的将军，

71
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:00,567
Titus, the eldest, had
become a famous general,

72
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,571
图密善成了家族中年轻的政治家

72
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,571
and Domitian became the
young politician in the family.

73
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,940
他们被称为弗拉维安王朝。

73
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,940
They were known as
the Flavian Dynasty.

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,911
看哪，罗马最新的荣耀，

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,911
Behold, Rome's latest glory,

75
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,247
是我儿子提图斯征服朱迪亚的后代

75
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,247
born of my son Titus's
conquest of Judea.

76
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,084
我和罗马的士兵们一起分享荣耀。

76
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,084
I share the glory with
the soldiers of Rome.

77
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,252
为罗马的市民而建

77
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,252
Built for the citizens of Rome

78
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,423
在尼禄从他们那里偷走的土地上

78
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,423
on the same land that
Nero stole from them,

79
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,959
建造这座黄金屋

79
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,959
to build this Golden House.

80
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,894
比我想象的要小。

80
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,894
It's smaller than I expected.

81
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,199
你是游戏大师吗，马苏斯领事？

81
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,199
Are you master of the
games, Consul Marsus?

82
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,500
你是埃迪尔·鲁迪吗

82
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,500
Are you Aedile Ludi?

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,569
相信我知道群众想要什么。

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,569
Credit me for knowing
what the crowd wants.

84
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,973
马克西姆斯竞技场适合战车比赛。

84
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,973
Circus Maximus is
fine for chariot racing.

85
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:41,975
观众想看血

85
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:41,975
The crowd wants to see blood,

86
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:43,843
他们想离得足够近才能看到

86
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:43,843
and they want to be
close enough to see it.

87
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:46,512
我已经命令了成千上万的动物和角斗士

87
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:46,512
I've ordered thousands
of animals and gladiators

88
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,180
从帝国的每个角落

88
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,180
from every corner of the empire.

89
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,481
从我们北方的前哨

89
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,481
From our northern outposts

90
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,850
一直到我们努米底亚的省份

90
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,850
all the way down to our
provinces in Numidia.

91
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,422
是的，在我们还在等待这家企业的股票发行的时候。

91
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,422
Yes, while we still await the
offering of shares in this enterprise.

92
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,658
啊我重新考虑过了。

92
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,658
Ah. Well, I've
reconsidered that.

93
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,028
不会有股份。

93
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,028
There will be no shares.

94
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,564
马克西姆斯马戏团属于你

94
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,564
Circus Maximus belongs to you,

95
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,268
四个派系的股东

95
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,268
the shareholders
of the four factions.

96
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,637
但是这个竞技场，

96
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,637
But this arena will, instead,

97
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,875
属于所有罗马公民

97
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,875
belong to all the
citizens of Rome.

98
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,783
维斯帕先皇帝，提图斯，图密善，所有的弗拉维亚人，

98
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,783
Emperor Vespasian, Titus,
Domitian, all of the Flavians,

99
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,485
他们什么都不是

99
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,485
they're nothing.

100
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,786
一个骡子家族。

100
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,786
A family of muleteers.

101
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,790
这些弗拉维亚人威胁到了我们的生存

101
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,790
These Flavians, they
threaten our very existence.

102
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,992
宣称这个新的竞技场属于罗马的公民，

102
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,992
Asserting that this new arena
belongs to the citizens of Rome,

103
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,161
这不过是个策略

103
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,161
it's nothing but a ploy

104
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,730
来满足他们无尽的贪欲

104
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,730
to satisfy their own
boundless greed.

105
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,798
它会耗尽我们从马克西姆斯马戏团获得的财富

105
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,798
It will sap the wealth we
derive from the Circus Maximus,

106
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,668
也许更糟的是我们仅存的权威和尊严

106
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,668
and perhaps worse, what's
left of our authority and gravitas.

107
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,939
执政官，说吧。说吧。

107
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,939
Consul, out with
it. Just say it.

108
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,141
- 一步一步来- 号

108
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,141
- One step at a time.
- No.

109
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,875
一步也不能动。

109
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,875
Not one step at the time.

110
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:53,545
这不仅仅是阻止弗拉维安圆形剧场。

110
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:53,545
It is about more than stopping
the Flavian Amphitheatre.

111
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,848
这是为了阻止弗拉维人。

111
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,848
It is about stopping
the Flavians.

112
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,350
小心点，女人。

112
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,350
Careful, woman.

113
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,351
一个念头就能导致处决。

113
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,351
A mere thought can
lead to execution.

114
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,321
你难道不愿意冒这个险

114
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,321
Wouldn't you
rather take that risk

115
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,956
也不愿被遗忘

115
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,956
than be buried in oblivion?

116
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,658
也许我妻子是对的

116
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,658
Perhaps my wife's right.

117
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,593
如果换了皇帝

117
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,593
If a change in the emperor

118
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,661
意味着他和我们所有人分享

118
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,661
means he shares with all of us.

119
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,499
维斯帕先活不了多久了。

119
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,499
Vespasian is not
long for this world.

120
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,970
大儿子提图斯有责任感。

120
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,970
Titus, the elder son,
has a sense of duty.

121
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,071
但图密善呢？

121
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,071
But what of Domitian?

122
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:20,973
贪财的那个。

122
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:20,973
The venal one.

123
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,709
想象一下他坐在椅子上。

123
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,709
Imagine him on the curule chair.

124
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,545
如果他成为皇帝，

124
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,545
Were he to become emperor,

125
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,516
那我们所有人都完了

125
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,516
that would be the
end of all of us.

126
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,430
听好了

126
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,430
Listen up.

127
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:48,334
我们需要一些水。现在

127
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:48,334
We need some water. Now.

128
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,036
好.

128
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,036
Good.

129
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,610
15袋两百。

129
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,610
Two hundred for 15 bags.

130
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,846
上等黎凡特粉红盐。

130
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,846
Finest grade Levant pink salt.

131
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,940
茱拉别说了

131
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,940
Jula, stop it.

132
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,411
奥拉你就不能告诉妈妈吗

132
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,411
Aura, can't you
just tell Mother?

133
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,147
你想让我跟她说什么？

133
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,147
What do you want me to tell her?

134
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:37,417
我很无聊想离开这里？

134
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:37,417
That I'm bored and I
want to get out of here?

135
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,885
你迟早会的。

135
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,885
Sooner or later you'll have to.

136
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:53,566
继续走

136
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:53,566
Keep going.

137
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:56,702
去吧，姑娘。

137
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:56,702
Go on, girl.

138
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,102
我喜欢

138
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,102
I like it.

139
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,173
跳舞吧

139
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,173
Dance.

140
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,743
- 你听到了！- 求你了

140
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,743
- You heard me!
- Please.

141
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,644
求你了不请不要...

141
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,644
Please. No. Please don't...

142
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,591
不不

142
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,591
No, no.

143
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,164
我要杀了你们两个。

143
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,164
I'll kill you both for that.

144
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:29,836
但首先，让我们和你一起玩。

144
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:29,836
But first, let's have
some fun with you.

145
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,890
这是什么？

145
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,890
What's this?

146
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,993
她是我妹妹

146
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,993
She's my sister.

147
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,327
安静！

147
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,327
Silence!

148
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:56,696
你杀了一个士兵

148
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:56,696
You killed a legionary.

149
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,798
- 他喝醉了。她... - 他是罗马公民。

149
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,798
- He was drunk. She's...
- He was a Roman citizen.

150
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,634
这两个现在是罗马的财产。

150
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,634
These two are now
the property of Rome.

151
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,303
- 带他们来！- 不，不，不。

151
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,303
- Bring them!
- No, no, no.

152
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,206
茱拉茱拉

152
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,206
Jula... Jula!

153
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:13,779
不！不！不！妈妈！妈妈！

153
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:13,779
No! Mother! Mother!

154
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,519
快吃完

154
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,519
Finish up.

155
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,691
我女儿们给我做饭换换口味。

155
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,691
My daughters are cooking
for me for a change.

156
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,019
茱拉灵气！

156
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,019
Jula! Aura!

157
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,892
妈妈！

157
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,892
Mother!

158
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,229
妈妈！妈妈！

158
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,229
Mother! Mother!

159
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,977
卡拉，你要去哪里？

159
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,977
Cala, where are you going?

160
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,581
我要去找我的女儿们。

160
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,581
I'm going after my daughters.

161
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,717
你儿子呢，夸梅？

161
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,717
What about your son, Kwame?

162
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,453
他在打猎。

162
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,453
He's on a hunt.

163
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,254
我不能等他。

163
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,254
I cannot wait for him.

164
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,716
众神在向我们微笑。

164
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,716
The gods smile on us.

165
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,586
罗马人愿意出三倍的价钱买它

165
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,586
The Romans will
pay triple for that one.

166
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,756
他属于神阿培德马克

166
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,756
He is of the god, Apedemak.

167
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,759
恶魔会保护他。

167
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,759
Demons will protect him.

168
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,961
我父亲族人的狮神。

168
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,961
The lion god of
my father's people.

169
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:10,764
我们不能带走他。

169
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:10,764
We cannot take him.

170
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,799
罗马人可以对付神和魔鬼。

170
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,799
The Romans can deal
with the gods and demons.

171
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,701
带他走

171
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,701
Take him.

172
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,903
否则你什么都得不到，夸梅。

172
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,903
Or you get nothing, Kwame.

173
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,431
快点！快点！

173
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,431
Now!

174
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,148
请原谅我

174
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,148
Please forgive me.

175
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:52,599
住手，你们这些傻瓜！

175
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:52,599
Stop, you fools!

176
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,899
我告诉过你，

176
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,899
I have told you,

177
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,869
我可以把他们弄下跳板。

177
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,869
I can get them
down the gangplank.

178
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,836
稳住伊利亚你现在不在贝提卡。

178
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,836
Steady, Elia. You
are not in Baetica now.

179
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,838
他们是无用的。他们会伤害他们。

179
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,838
They are useless.
They will hurt them.

180
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,307
我可以做得更好。

180
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,307
I can do it better.

181
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,875
放下吧

181
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,875
Put it down.

182
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,977
我不需要什么暴发户西班牙人

182
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,977
I don't need some
upstart Spaniard

183
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,312
告诉我怎么做我的工作

183
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,312
telling me how to do my job.

184
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,847
我卸的马比你几天卸的还多。

184
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,847
I've unloaded more
horses than you have days.

185
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,418
我们的马再也不会被扔进那个该死的吊带里了。

185
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,418
Not one more of our horses
goes in that damn sling.

186
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,321
如果我是你，我会听我弟弟的。

186
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,321
I'd listen to our little
brother if I were you.

187
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,489
他知道马。

187
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,489
He knows horses.

188
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:17,923
我卸过犀牛。

188
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:17,923
I've unloaded rhinos.

189
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,826
你可以把大象卸下来。

189
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,826
You could have
unloaded elephants.

190
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,927
我不管

190
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,927
I don't care.

191
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,963
去他妈的让他们自己做。

191
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,963
Fuck 'em. Let them
do it themselves.

192
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,232
我有六艘船等着卸货。

192
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,232
I have six boats
waiting to be unloaded.

193
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,869
从埃及来的运粮船有消息吗？

193
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,869
Any word of the grain
ships from Egypt?

194
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,447
已经三个星期了，没有食物，

194
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,447
It's been three weeks,
and without food,

195
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,273
人们越来越焦躁不安。

195
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,273
the people are growing
more and more restless.

196
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,275
呃，可能今天到，也可能明天到。

196
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,275
Ugh, they might arrive
today, maybe tomorrow.

197
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,144
风暴向南。

197
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,144
Storms to the south.

198
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,013
一看到他们就通知我。

198
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,013
Send word as soon
as they're sighted.

199
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:43,216
稳住稳住就这样

199
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:43,216
Steady. Steady. That's it.

200
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,750
就这样

200
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,750
That's it.

201
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,320
好孩子容易.

201
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,320
Good boy. Easy.

202
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,724
就这样就这样

202
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,724
That's it. That's it.

203
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,626
罗马书第

203
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,626
Romans.

204
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,850
从埃及来的船被耽搁了。

204
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,850
Ships from Egypt are delayed.

205
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,784
没有谷物。明天再来。

205
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,784
There's no grain.
Come back tomorrow.

206
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,253
这是昨天的话。

206
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,253
That was the word yesterday.

207
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,022
我们已经三个星期没有粮食了。

207
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,022
It's been three weeks
since we had grain.

208
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,524
- 你听到我说的了。- 人们在挨饿

208
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,524
- You heard what I said.
- People are starving.

209
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,744
我们该吃什么？

209
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,744
What are we supposed to eat?

210
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,826
罗马无法给予它没有的东西。

210
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,826
Rome cannot give
what it does not have.

211
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,895
我没看到有参议员挨饿。

211
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,895
I don't see any
senators starving.

212
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,298
他们是最大的水蛭。

212
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,298
And they are the biggest
leeches of them all.

213
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,278
也许我们可以把我们的投诉

213
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,278
Perhaps we'll take our complaint

214
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,248
直接送到维斯帕西恩和他的幼崽那里

214
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,248
straight to Vespasian
and his pups.

215
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,049
去帕拉蒂尼！

215
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,049
To the Palatine!

216
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,552
去帕拉蒂尼！去帕拉蒂尼！

216
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,552
To the Palatine!
To the Palatine!

217
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,827
嘿，又有骚乱了。

217
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,827
Hey, there's another riot.

218
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,129
这次又是什么

218
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,129
What is it this time?

219
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,764
管他呢？走吧来吧伙计们

219
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,764
Who cares? Let's
go. Come on, guys.

220
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,437
去帕拉蒂尼！

220
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,437
To the Palatine!

221
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:14,573
去帕拉蒂尼！去帕拉蒂尼！

221
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:14,573
To the Palatine!
To the Palatine!

222
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,375
一起来！我们走！

222
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,375
All together! Let's go!

223
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,753
去帕拉蒂尼！去帕拉蒂尼！

223
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,753
To the Palatine!
To the Palatine!

224
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,888
去帕拉蒂尼！

224
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,888
To the Palatine!

225
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,157
去帕拉蒂尼。走！

225
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,157
Move to the Palatine. Go!

226
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,192
快，快！

226
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,192
Move, move!

227
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,025
为你的罪行付出代价！

227
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,025
Pay for your crimes!

228
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,559
为你的罪行付出代价！

228
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,559
Pay for your crimes!

229
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,843
快点！进去！

229
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,843
Quick! Inside!

230
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,413
关上大门！好了！

230
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,413
Close the gates! All right!

231
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:30,450
为你的罪行付出代价！为你的罪行付出代价！

231
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:30,450
Pay for your crimes!
Pay for your crimes!

232
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,286
来了

232
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,286
Come.

233
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,288
你笑着，因为他们要求你的血。

233
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,288
You laugh as they
call for your blood.

234
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,525
在神圣的尼禄皇帝统治下，每天都有骚乱。

234
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,525
Under the divine Emperor
Nero, there was daily rioting.

235
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,029
你弟弟在哪？

235
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,029
Where is your brother?

236
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,964
我猜是去操他的犹太女王了

236
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,964
Off fucking his Judean
Queen, I imagine.

237
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,099
他应该在这里。

237
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,099
Well, he should be here.

238
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,934
那帮暴徒要杀我们

238
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,934
That mob is out for our blood.

239
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,903
Good reason.他们饿了

239
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,903
Good reason. They're hungry.

240
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,044
只有禁卫军

240
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,044
With only the Palace Guard

241
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,464
和一个世纪的禁卫军

241
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,464
and one century
of our Praetorians,

242
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,973
我不知道我们能坚持多久。

242
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,973
I'm not sure how
long we can hold.

243
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,576
当你被围困在阿莱西亚时，

243
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,576
When you were
besieged at Alesia,

244
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,412
你用声东击西引开了袭击者

244
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,412
you used a diversion to
draw your attackers away.

245
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,747
你没有吗？

245
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,747
Did you not?

246
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,384
驾！驾！

246
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,384
Hyah! Hyah!

247
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:22,935
什么事？

247
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:22,935
What is it?

248
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,537
又是一场食物暴动，大人。

248
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,537
Another food riot, my lord.

249
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,640
皇帝计划一场比赛来吸引骚乱者。

249
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,640
And the emperor plans a
race to draw the rioters away.

250
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,876
为你的罪行付出代价！

250
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,876
Pay for your crimes!

251
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,979
为你的罪行付出代价！

251
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,979
Pay for your crimes!

252
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,259
罗马和平就到此为止了。

252
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,259
So much for Pax Romana.

253
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,895
你觉得一直都是这样吗

253
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,895
You think it's like
this all the time?

254
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,230
希望不是

254
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,230
Let's hope not.

255
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,536
今天有比赛。

255
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,536
There's a race today.

256
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,371
今天没有比赛。

256
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,371
There's not a race today.

257
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,707
你是瞎了还是白痴？

257
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,707
Are you blind or just an idiot?

258
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,608
看啊

258
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,608
Look at that.

259
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:03,709
让我们看看

259
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:03,709
Let's see that.

260
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,117
- 鼓- 我没聋。

260
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,117
- Drums.
- I'm not deaf.

261
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,752
天蝎座无处可寻。

261
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,752
Scorpus is nowhere to be found.

262
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,188
芬布里亚到处都找过了

262
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,188
Fimbria's looked everywhere.

263
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,156
我能猜到。我去叫他

263
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,156
I can guess. I'll go get him.

264
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,857
你们两个准备好下注。

264
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,857
You two get set
up for the betting.

265
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,163
慢点慢点

265
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,163
Slowly, slowly.

266
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,731
小心点

266
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,731
Be careful.

267
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:26,832
菌毛

267
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:26,832
Fimbria!

268
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,001
我们两天内都不应该比赛的。

268
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,001
We were not supposed to
race for another two days.

269
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,236
我们还没准备好。

269
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,236
We are not ready.

270
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,739
皇帝说我们比赛，我们就比赛。

270
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,739
When the emperor
says we race, we race.

271
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,787
天蝎座。

271
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,787
Scorpus.

272
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,723
嗨

272
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,723
Hi.

273
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:53,826
天蝎座？

273
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:53,826
Scorpus?

274
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,096
天蝎座。

274
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,096
Scorpus.

275
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,230
起来

275
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,230
Get up.

276
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,699
为什么？为什么？

276
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,699
Why?

277
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,769
别再吵了。

277
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,769
Stop that noise.

278
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,541
我们后天才比赛。

278
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,541
We are not supposed to race
until the day after tomorrow.

279
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,577
鼓声可能表明情况有所改变。

279
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,577
The drums might
suggest that's changed.

280
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,880
除非你开车，否则几乎没有人下注。

280
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,880
There's barely any betting
unless you're driving.

281
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,448
起来

281
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,448
Get up.

282
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,885
安东尼娅·塞维留斯，你的光临让我荣誉。

282
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,885
Antonia Servilius, you honor
such a place with your presence.

283
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,788
你要是敢对我指手画脚，我就把你眼珠子挖出来。

283
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,788
Look at me in judgment, I'll
have your eyes gouged out.

284
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,596
你和这东西的友谊降低了你的身份。

284
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,596
You lower yourself by
friendship with this thing.

285
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,404
马苏斯领事的妻子你老板？

285
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,404
The wife of Consul
Marsus. Your boss?

286
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,306
蓝色阵营的主人。

286
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,306
The owner of the Blue Faction.

287
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,275
她爱我

287
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,275
She loves me.

288
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,978
- 但为什么呢？- 就像我总是赢一样。

288
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,978
- But why?
- Same as why I always win.

289
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,682
- 因为我可以。- 即使是几百万？

289
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,682
- Because I can.
- Even hungover?

290
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:49,781
即使喝醉了。

290
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:49,781
Even drunk.

291
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,953
或许能让你清醒点。

291
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,953
Maybe that'll sober you up.

292
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,109
母亲爸爸要去哪

292
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,109
Mother. Where's Father going?

293
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,377
来吧

293
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,377
Come on.

294
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,547
- 是天蝎座！- 看是天蝎座

294
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,547
- It's Scorpus!
- Look, it's Scorpus.

295
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,315
- 你是对的- 快点.

295
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,315
- You're right.
- Hurry.

296
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,883
- 快点。-哦！

296
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,883
- Come on.
- Oh!

297
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,655
是天蝎座。

297
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,655
It's Scorpus.

298
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,525
- 去吧小心点去，装上，快。- 走吧快

298
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,525
-Go, careful. Go, rig it, quickly.
-Go. Faster.

299
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,693
哦，你是芬布里亚？

299
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,693
Oh, you are Fimbria?

300
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,096
我有一封来自伊斯帕尼亚贝蒂卡的介绍信。

300
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,096
I have a letter of introduction
from Hispania Baetica.

301
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:39,865
我们有十匹最好的西班牙种马。

301
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:39,865
Uh, we have ten Spanish
stallions of the highest quality.

302
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,469
我看起来像是从奴隶那里买马吗？

302
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,469
Does it look like I'm
buying horses from slaves?

303
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,471
呃，你们的皇帝让西班牙人

303
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,471
Uh, your emperor
made the Spanish

304
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,338
罗马公民，碰巧。

304
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,338
Roman citizens, as it happens.

305
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,141
听着，除非你是皇帝，

305
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,141
Look, unless you
are the emperor,

306
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,509
你可以滚了

306
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,509
you can fuck off.

307
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,659
巴克斯来了。

307
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,659
Bacchus has arrived.

308
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,329
哦，终于。

308
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,329
Oh, finally.

309
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,698
谢谢你，Tenax。

309
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,698
Thank you, Tenax.

310
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,634
天蝎座不比赛的时候下注就少了

310
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,634
Betting's light when The
Great Scorpus isn't racing.

311
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:17,804
那是天蝎座

311
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:17,804
That's Scorpus.

312
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,306
- 我的鞋呢？- 刚从牧场回来，

312
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,306
- Where is my bays?
- Just in from pasture,

313
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,050
- 被脊甲化了- 这对马不好

313
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,050
- being harnessed now.
- It's bad for horses

314
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,911
- 没有做好充分的准备。- 向皇上告状。

314
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,911
- not to be properly prepared.
- Complain to the emperor.

315
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,010
我会的

315
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,010
I intend to.

316
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,115
走开！

316
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,115
Go away!

317
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,616
你没什么好看的。

317
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,616
You have nothing to see here.

318
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:31,984
走开！

318
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:31,984
Away!

319
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:35,721
我看他没什么特别的。

319
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:35,721
He doesn't look
so special to me.

320
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,224
他有86匹马赢了。

320
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,224
He has 86 four horse wins.

321
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,427
是马在奔跑。

321
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,427
It's the horses that run.

322
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,595
你带走他的马，

322
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,595
You take his horses,

323
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,464
- 他赢的钱归我。- 他的女人归我。

323
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,464
- I'll take his winnings.
- And I'll take his woman.

324
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,000
快，快！

324
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,000
Come on, come on!

325
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,570
加夫罗斯，他怎么样？

325
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,570
Gavros, how is he?

326
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,473
他会好很多的。他今天早上跑了一趟。

326
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,473
He'll be much better. He
did a light run this morning.

327
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,142
快点，我们走。

327
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,142
Come on, let's move.

328
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,711
你疯了吗？来吧

328
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,711
Are you crazy? Come on.

329
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,413
开始

329
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,413
Incitatus.

330
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,083
你今天好吗？

330
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,083
How are you today, huh?

331
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,817
我漂亮的儿子。

331
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,817
My beautiful boy.

332
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,288
你尝过吗？

332
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,288
Have you tasted it?

333
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,557
当然了我还活着

333
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,557
Of course. I'm still alive.

334
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:12,826
- 所以呢？- 所以...

334
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:12,826
- So?
- So...

335
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,230
结构良好，有一点醋的味道。

335
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,230
Well-formed, with a
slight scent of vinegar.

336
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,766
太完美了

336
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,766
It's perfect.

337
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,711
- 他会跑得像风一样。- 好极了来吧，我们走吧。

337
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,711
- He will run like the wind.
- Excellent. Come on, let's go.

338
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,836
我们走吧，因西塔斯。来吧

338
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,836
Let's go, Incitatus. Come on.

339
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,540
第一声号角随时会吹响。

339
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,540
The first trumpets
are any minute.

340
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,242
这些是我最新的钻机。

340
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,242
These are my newest rigs.

341
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:31,644
很神奇，是吧？

341
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:31,644
Amazing, huh?

342
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,314
- 你说什么？不，不。

342
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,314
What? No, no, no, no.

343
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,749
这是...这是什么？

343
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,749
What is... What is this?

344
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,692
- 我们谈过了- 天蝎座的新装备？

344
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,692
- We talked about this.
- A new rig for Scorpus?

345
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,352
不我不记得了

345
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,352
No, no, no. I don't
remember that.

346
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,886
是啊，你可能喝醉了。

346
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,886
Yeah, you were probably drunk.

347
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,655
这双更轻转弯时更好

347
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,655
These are lighter,
better on the turns.

348
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,037
我们在他们身上花了一大笔钱。

348
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,037
We have spent a fortune on them.

349
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,727
福图纳有多少次喜欢我的旧装备？

349
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,727
How many times has Fortuna
favored me in my old rig?

350
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:50,663
去吧，得到它！

350
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:50,663
Go, get it!

351
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,432
你听到他说的了

351
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,432
You heard him.

352
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,433
把旧的拿来。走！

352
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,433
Get the old one. Go!

353
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:55,902
- 为胜利干杯。- 为胜利干杯。

353
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:55,902
- To victory.
- To victory.

354
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,337
又是你？

354
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,337
You again?

355
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,772
你们是什么人，间谍吗？

355
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,772
What are you,
spies for the touts?

356
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,607
我们只是想卖掉安达卢西亚人。

356
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,607
We're just looking to
sell our Andalusians.

357
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,676
我告诉过你，我不会

357
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,676
I told you, I'm not gonna deal

358
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,712
跟你和你的老马群在一起你说什么？

358
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,712
with you and your old nags. Huh?

359
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,615
安达卢西亚人？

359
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,615
Andalusians?

360
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:10,949
是的

360
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:10,949
Yes.

361
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:12,719
让我们看看

361
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:12,719
Let's see them.

362
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:14,887
来这边

362
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:14,887
Come, this way.

363
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:18,692
一共13只手，两条腿转，非常紧，

363
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:18,692
All over 13 hands,
two leg turns, very tight,

364
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,694
没有鞭子，像雪一样白色。

364
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,694
no whip and white as snow.

365
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,431
你是卖还是租？

365
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,431
Are you selling or leasing?

366
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,699
呃，卖东西。

366
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,699
Uh, selling.

367
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,666
你可是从西班牙远道而来。

367
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,666
You're a long way from Spain.

368
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,536
这些马对西班牙来说太好了。

368
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,536
These horses are
too good for Spain.

369
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,136
太贵了。

369
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,136
And too expensive.

370
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:34,074
我们想赚足够的钱在家里建一个养殖场。

370
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:34,074
We're looking to make enough to
set up a breeding farm back home.

371
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:37,009
- 两条腿转？- 是的

371
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:37,009
- Two leg turns?
- Yes.

372
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,980
比赛结束后我会和芬布里亚谈谈。

372
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,980
I'll speak to Fimbria
after the race.

373
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,724
天蝎座在比赛。

373
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,724
Scorpus is racing.

374
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,297
蓝派9比3

374
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,297
Blue Faction, 9-3 odds.

375
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,698
司机...

375
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,698
Driver...

376
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,967
天蝎座。

376
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,967
Scorpus.

377
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,211
所有这些都押白色赢。

377
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,211
All of these on White to win.

378
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,778
分散赌注。

378
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,778
Spread the bets.

379
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,980
这样明智吗你已经欠了这么多。

379
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,980
Is that wise? You
already owe so much.

380
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,317
我留你在这里是为了你的嘴和屁股。

380
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,317
I keep you around for
your mouth and your ass.

381
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,818
不是为了听你的建议。

381
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,818
Not for your advice.

382
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,428
你看起来很美，父亲。

382
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,428
You look magnificent, Father.

383
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,561
- 是吗？

383
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,561
Yeah?

384
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:33,732
我觉得自己像马粪。

384
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:33,732
Well, I feel like horse dung.

385
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:35,510
希望你是对的。

385
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:35,510
I hope you're right about this.

386
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,037
你叫提多来了吗？

386
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,037
Have you sent for Titus?

387
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,005
是的

387
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,005
Yes.

388
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:42,342
前几天，在我们参观弗拉维安竞技场时，

388
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:42,342
The other day, during our
tour of the Flavian Arena,

389
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:43,742
你透露了太多

389
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:43,742
you revealed too much

390
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,046
你是被自己的想法唤醒的

390
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,046
that you were aroused
by your own idea.

391
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:47,881
原谅我我

391
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:47,881
Forgive me.

392
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,983
控制我们的情绪是最重要的。

392
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,983
Control of our
emotions is paramount.

393
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:51,984
是的，父亲。

393
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:51,984
Yes, Father.

394
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:53,805
这一课也能让我哥哥受益。

394
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:53,805
A lesson that could
also benefit my brother.

395
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,954
- 是的- 尽管...

395
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,954
- Yes.
- Although...

396
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:59,792
也许我们应该为他和他的犹太女王走了而高兴

396
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:59,792
perhaps we should be happy
he's off with his Judean Queen.

397
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,528
如果他在这里，罗马的街道将血流成河。

397
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,528
Were he here, Rome's
streets would be a river of blood.

398
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:03,663
嗯.

398
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:03,663
Hmm.

399
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,799
神父，来点颜色？

399
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,799
Father, some color, perhaps?

400
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,701
- 颜色？- 在上脸颊。

400
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,701
- Color?
- On the upper cheeks.

401
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,769
号

401
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,769
No.

402
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,739
民众希望看到一个健康的皇帝。

402
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,739
The crowd wants to
see a healthy emperor.

403
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:16,942
颜色.

403
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:16,942
Color.

404
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,779
我希望这不会让你觉得绝望。

404
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,779
I hope this doesn't
reek of desperation.

405
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:25,818
给马苏斯领事让路

405
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:25,818
Make way for Consul Marsus.

406
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,220
让开

406
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,220
Make way.

407
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,292
领事

407
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,292
Consul.

408
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,936
鲁弗斯为蓝调做好准备

408
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,936
Rufus! Ready for the Blues

409
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,572
让他们的马被踢了吗

409
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,572
to get their horses
kicked today?

410
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,641
天蝎座和因西塔斯击败了白人

410
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,641
Scorpus and Incitatus
beat the Whites

411
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:49,776
连续三次

411
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:49,776
three times in a row.

412
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,344
我们的钱在氙气上。

412
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,344
Our money is on Xenon.

413
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,548
- 氙气氙气氙气- 天蝎座可以随时击败氙气。

413
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,548
- Xenon! Xenon! Xenon!
- Scorpus can beat Xenon anytime.

414
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,117
- 任何一天。- 让我们看看。

414
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,117
- Any day.
- Let's see about that.

415
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,195
- 你拿到了吗- 是啊

415
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,195
- Do you have it?
- Yeah.

416
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,000
从因西塔斯的马内。

416
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,000
From the mane of Incitatus.

417
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,538
像这样的，

417
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,538
With such as this,

418
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,406
我会看到一切。

418
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,406
I will see everything.

419
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,576
- 你想认识维克托？- 号

419
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,576
- You wish to know the victor?
- No.

420
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,512
他领先的那一轮。

420
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,512
The round in which
he takes the lead.

421
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:28,948
对其他人来说不可能，

421
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:28,948
Impossible for any other,

422
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,417
但对我来说，有了这个

422
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,417
but for me, with this,

423
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:35,020
福图纳会告诉我一切。

423
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:35,020
Fortuna will show me all.

424
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,527
福图纳笑了。

424
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,527
Fortuna smiles.

425
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,695
这匹马会赢

425
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,695
This horse will win,

426
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,164
在第二局领先

426
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,164
taking the lead on the second

427
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,067
到最后一轮。

427
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,067
to the last round.

428
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:49,602
你确定吗

428
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:49,602
Are you certain?

429
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,171
别侮辱我。

429
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,171
Do not insult me.

430
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,205
否则我诅咒你。

430
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,205
Or I curse you.

431
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,394
下一个

431
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,394
Next.

432
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,730
下一个是谁？

432
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,730
Who's next?

433
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,530
是的

433
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,530
Yes.

434
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,939
全押白色。

434
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,939
All on White.

435
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,184
给你，全押白色。

435
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,184
Here, all on White.

436
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,223
动下一个

436
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,223
Move. Next.

437
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:46,092
滚开鲁弗斯

437
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:46,092
Piss off, Rufus.

438
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:47,936
等你把欠我的钱还了再来

438
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:47,936
Come back when you
have the money you owe me.

439
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:49,328
我想下注。

439
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:49,328
I want to place a bet.

440
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,230
不能再赊账了。

440
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,230
No more credit.

441
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,200
你应该庆幸我没割开你的喉咙

441
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,200
Consider yourself lucky
I haven't slit your throat

442
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:56,336
呢

442
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:56,336
yet.

443
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,904
我有很有价值的东西要赌。

443
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,904
I have something of
great value to wager.

444
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,807
五百股蓝色阵营的股票。

444
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,807
500 shares of the Blue Faction.

445
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:07,946
- 你妻子的股份？- 不是她的。

445
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:07,946
- Your wife's shares?
- They're not hers.

446
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:10,316
她是我妻子，所以他们也是我的

446
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:10,316
She's my wife, which
makes them mine.

447
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,416
很大的赌注。

447
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,416
Very big bet.

448
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:13,420
你可以击垮我

448
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:13,420
You could break me.

449
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:16,455
Scorpus in the Blues赢得比赛

449
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:16,455
Scorpus in the Blues to win.

450
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:17,557
四比一。

450
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:17,557
Four to one.

451
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,359
大了大得多。

451
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:20,359
Big. Much bigger.

452
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,396
天蝎座在倒数第二轮比赛中领先，

452
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,396
Scorpus to pull to the front
on the second-to-last round,

453
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,932
赢得比赛

453
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,932
and win the race.

454
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,534
你想赌一轮吗？

454
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,534
You want to make a round bet?

455
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,403
你知道什么我不知道的吗？

455
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,403
Do you know something I don't?

456
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,672
你愿意打赌吗？

456
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,672
Will you take the bet?

457
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,273
如果不是，我去别的地方。

457
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,273
If not, I go elsewhere.

458
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,346
八比一。

458
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,346
Eight to one.

459
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:42,182
每股八千塞斯特斯。

459
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:42,182
8,000 sesterces per share.

460
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,282
完了

460
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,282
Done.

461
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:55,828
天蝎座在最后一轮领先。

461
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:55,828
Scorpus to take the
lead in the final round.

462
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:57,830
你明白吗？走了

462
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:57,830
Do you understand? Go.

463
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:00,432
35押白色。

463
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:00,432
35 on White.

464
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:13,380
我很紧张。两个塞斯特斯。

464
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:13,380
I'm tight. Two sesterces.

465
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,748
一个塞斯特斯。

465
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,748
One sesterces.

466
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,449
我比她更紧。

466
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,449
And I'm tighter than her.

467
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,519
三个塞斯特斯，我比他们俩都紧。

467
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,519
Three sesterces and I'm
tighter than both of them.

468
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:20,618
嗨

468
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:20,618
Hi.

469
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:44,711
图密善的性爱玩具在赌一大笔钱

469
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:44,711
Domitian's fuck toy is
betting an enormous amount

470
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,078
赌你赢

470
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,078
on you to win.

471
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,623
别玩了

471
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,623
Stop playing.

472
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,290
吃吧

472
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,290
Eat.

473
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:18,411
这有些出乎意料。

473
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:18,411
This was somewhat unexpected.

474
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,680
- 我几乎没有时间穿衣服。- 我听说了。

474
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,680
- I barely had time to dress.
- So I'm told.

475
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,750
或许你应该谨慎一点因为这有损我的尊严。

475
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,750
Perhaps a little more discretion
as it diminishes my dignitas.

476
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:25,919
容我提醒你亲爱的

476
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:25,919
May I remind you, my love,

477
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,395
你的尊严

477
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,395
that a good measure
of your dignitas

478
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,088
是从我的姓氏而来的

478
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,088
is derived from my family name.

479
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:30,824
我们不要忘记这一点。

479
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:30,824
Let us not forget that.

480
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,759
很难，因为你经常提醒我。

480
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,759
Difficult, given your
frequent reminders.

481
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:35,060
领事Antonia.

481
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:35,060
Consul. Antonia.

482
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:36,962
愿诸神再次眷顾我们。

482
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:36,962
May the gods favor us again.

483
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,631
我想他们会的

483
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,631
Oh, I expect they will.

484
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,102
安东尼娅，你怎么评价天蝎座最近的驾驶技术？

484
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,102
Antonia, how would you judge
Scorpus' driving skills of late?

485
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:44,170
他知道如何对待一匹纯种马。

485
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:44,170
He knows how to
treat a thoroughbred.

486
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,492
等等神父

486
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,492
Uh, wait, Father.

487
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,473
现在

487
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,473
Now.

488
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:06,617
听他们的

488
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:06,617
Listen to them.

489
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:10,557
在召唤我们的血之后。

489
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:10,557
So soon after
calling for our blood.

490
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:14,693
马苏斯领事的笑容很阴险

490
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:14,693
Consul Marsus
has a viper's smile.

491
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,463
是啊

491
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,463
Yeah.

492
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:22,067
朋友亲近，敌人更亲近。

492
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:22,067
Friends close, enemies closer.

493
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,804
伪装者更近了。

493
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,804
Pretenders closer still.

494
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,311
罗马的市民们！

494
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,311
Citizens of Rome!

495
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:37,717
我向你们介绍，选手们！

495
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:37,717
I present to you,
the contestants!

496
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,556
四个派系。

496
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,556
Four factions.

497
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:48,528
八辆战车和八个司机

497
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:48,528
Eight chariots and eight drivers

498
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:51,431
要么开车要么死

498
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:51,431
drive or die

499
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,866
走向胜利！

499
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,866
towards victory!

500
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:58,003
绿色队在失利后寻求胜利，

500
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:58,003
The Green seeking
a win after loss,

501
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:01,040
失去之后，失去之后！

501
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:01,040
after loss, after loss!

502
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:02,942
笑声使我们减少。

502
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:02,942
The laughter diminishes us.

503
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,345
但有埃斯塔修斯和阿维塔斯。

503
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,345
But there's Estasius and Avitas.

504
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,513
而红军呢，是被涂成红色

504
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,513
And the Reds, is it painted red,

505
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:10,215
还是最后一次看到的沉船上的血

505
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:10,215
or is it blood from the
last-seen shipwreck?

506
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,619
号那是酒

506
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,619
No. That was wine.

507
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,155
在白色派系中，

507
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,155
In the White Faction,

508
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:17,791
和宽袖车手氙一起

508
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:17,791
with Xenon, the
wide-sleeved driver...

509
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,858
氙气氙气氙气

509
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,858
Xenon! Xenon! Xenon!

510
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:23,362
爱斯普宁的阿多尼斯

510
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:23,362
The Adonis of the Esponine.

511
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:27,132
蓝军和寇科在后面擦屁股

511
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:27,132
And wiping up the
rear, the Blues with Kirko

512
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,635
还有伟大的天蝎座！

512
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,635
and The Great Scorpus!

513
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,472
我们走吧！

513
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,472
Let's go!

514
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,275
他的快马，从奥林匹斯山下来，

514
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,275
With his speed horse,
alighted here from Olympus,

515
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:38,744
伟大的因西塔斯

515
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:38,744
the great Incitatus.

516
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,248
不死不休！

516
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,248
Rise or die!

517
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:58,664
哇哦

517
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:58,664
Whoa.

518
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:06,072
至少你可以说你和大天蝎座赛跑了

518
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:06,072
At least you can say you raced
against The Great Scorpus.

519
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,952
战车准备好了吗

519
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,952
Chariots, ready?

520
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,956
比赛开始了

520
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,956
The race is on.

521
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,724
停止下注。

521
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,724
Betting's closed.

522
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,760
驾！

522
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,760
Hyah!

523
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:17,476
- 你看到了吗？- 他要毁掉至关重要的白色车。

523
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:17,476
- Did you see that?
- He's gonna destroy the vital White cart.

524
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,478
这可不够

524
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,478
It'll take more than that.

525
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,213
来吧！

525
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,213
Come on!

526
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:29,755
来吧！

526
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:29,755
Come on!

527
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,809
又来了

527
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,809
Here it comes.

528
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,650
驾！

528
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,650
Hyah!

529
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:03,590
哦，我的天啊！

529
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:03,590
Oh!

530
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,172
- 残骸- 船

530
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,172
- Wreck.
- Ship.

531
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,742
残骸！船！残骸！船！残骸！

531
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,742
Wreck! Ship! Wreck! Ship! Wreck!

532
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,347
- 我错过了什么？- 不多

532
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,347
- What did I miss?
- Not much.

533
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:32,818
快，检查滑轮！

533
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:32,818
Quick, check the pulley!

534
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,688
先清理基地！

534
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,688
Clear the base first!

535
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:43,829
请给我一张票.

535
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:43,829
One ticket, please.

536
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:51,871
提图斯将军

536
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:51,871
General Titus.

537
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,317
快去快去

537
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,317
Go, go, go!

538
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:06,385
离开赛道！

538
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:06,385
Off the track!

539
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,121
快去快去

539
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,121
Go, go, go!

540
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:10,590
天啊！你在干什麽？

540
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:10,590
Dear God! What are you doing?

541
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,605
天蝎座，现在！倒数第二轮！

541
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,605
Scorpus, now!
Second-to-last round!

542
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,811
- 父亲- 他们在我们的门口

542
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,811
- Father.
- They were at our gate

543
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:33,146
呼唤我们的鲜血

543
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:33,146
calling for our blood.

544
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:35,014
- 听我解释- 现在不行

544
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:35,014
- Let me explain.
- Not now.

545
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:40,887
很高兴见到你，兄弟。你错过了今早的好戏。

545
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:40,887
Pleased to see you, brother.
You missed the fun this morning.

546
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,786
是啊，我会搞定那些暴徒的。

546
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,786
Yes, well, I would have
taken care of the mob.

547
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:44,655
你不能用你的剑解决所有问题。

547
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:44,655
You can't solve every
problem with your sword.

548
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:46,693
他们需要食物来补充内脏。

548
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:46,693
They needed food for their guts.

549
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:48,927
- 不是内脏。- 快到了

549
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:48,927
- Not gutting.
- It's arriving.

550
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:51,398
- 明天就到了。- 你一直这么说。

550
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:51,398
- It's there tomorrow.
- So you keep telling us.

551
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:52,599
我最好还是招待他们

551
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:52,599
Better I entertain them

552
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:54,000
比你的军团士兵杀了他们还多

552
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:54,000
than your
legionnaires kill them.

553
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,802
安静点，

553
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,802
Be quiet,

554
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:56,670
现在

554
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:56,670
now.

555
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,438
- 天蝎座，现在！现在！- 天蝎座！

555
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,438
- Scorpus, now! Now!
- Scorpus!

556
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,775
容易.容易.

556
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,775
Easy. Easy.

557
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:04,110
快点！快点！

557
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:04,110
Now!

558
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:08,590
看看他的两匹马。

558
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:08,590
Look at his two center horses.

559
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:10,050
他们几乎不拉。

559
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:10,050
They're barely pulling.

560
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,588
天蝎座又是最后一名

560
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,588
Oh, Scorpus is last again,

561
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:18,224
也是他后来居上的一次胜利

561
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:18,224
and for one of his
come-from-behind victories.

562
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:19,759
也许这次不会

562
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:19,759
Maybe not this time.

563
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:23,463
驾！

563
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:23,463
Hyah!

564
00:39:23,563 --> 00:39:25,130
Incitatus...

564
00:39:23,563 --> 00:39:25,130
Incitatus...

565
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,335
现在，因西塔斯，现在！

565
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,335
Now, Incitatus, now!

566
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:32,003
嘿！嘿！

566
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:32,003
Hey!

567
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:43,483
你对诡计百看不厌。

567
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:43,483
You never tire of the artifice.

568
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,161
技巧使它具有娱乐性

568
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,161
The artifice is what
makes it entertaining

569
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:46,385
而且有利可图

569
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:46,385
and profitable.

570
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:48,320
嗯，我更喜欢战场上的清晰。

570
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:48,320
Well, I prefer the
clarity of the battlefield.

571
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,664
你以为罗马不是战场吗

571
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,664
You think Rome
isn't a battlefield?

572
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:51,467
不，不，这是一个...这也许是个战场

572
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:51,467
No, no, it's a... It's a
battlefield, perhaps,

573
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,726
但没有明确的。

573
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,726
but one without clarity.

574
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:54,827
- 这让它变得更有趣。- 够了

574
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:54,827
- Which makes it all the more interesting.
- Enough.

575
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,268
冲，天蝎座，冲！

575
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,268
Go, Scorpus, go!

576
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:06,438
兴奋，更多。更多.

576
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:06,438
Incitatus, more. More.

577
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,173
更多.

577
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,173
More.

578
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,313
喔！

578
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,313
Whoo!

579
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:37,670
来吧！

579
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:37,670
Come on!

580
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:41,074
让那个狗娘养的看看你的厉害

580
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:41,074
Show that son of a
bitch what you're made of!

581
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,876
快点，快点！

581
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:43,876
Come on, faster!

582
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,978
啊！我的天啊！

582
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,978
Ah!

583
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:52,284
耶!

583
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:52,284
Yeah!

584
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:53,853
是的，我会的

584
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:53,853
Yes!

585
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:01,161
- 该死的天蝎座- 我的天啊！

585
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:01,161
- Fucking Scorpus.
- God!

586
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,327
该死的天蝎座

586
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,327
Fucking Scorpus.

587
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:10,103
我们的孩子，总是让人失望，不是吗？

587
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:10,103
Our boy, never fails
to disappoint, eh?

588
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:11,237
从来没有

588
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:11,237
Never.

589
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,648
- 父亲- 号

589
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,648
- Father.
- No.

590
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:24,117
- 神父，听我解释。- 后

590
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:24,117
- Father, let me explain.
- Later.

591
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:28,588
记住，当众表扬。

591
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:28,588
Remember, praise in public.

592
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:32,224
私下里的纪律。

592
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:32,224
Discipline in private.

593
00:41:36,963 --> 00:41:41,900
天蝎座！天蝎座

593
00:41:36,963 --> 00:41:41,900
Scorpus! Scorpus!

594
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,516
你今天输了。

594
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,516
You lost today.

595
00:41:57,617 --> 00:41:59,719
只有钱。实际上，很多，

595
00:41:57,617 --> 00:41:59,719
Only money.
Quite a lot, in fact,

596
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,987
但我赢得了更重要的东西

596
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,987
but I won something
far more important.

597
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:04,289
我在父亲眼里削弱了我哥哥的力量。

597
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:04,289
I weakened my brother
in my father's eyes.

598
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:22,842
- 你好- 嗨

598
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:22,842
- Hello.
- Hi.

599
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:25,077
- 你有空吗？- 当然了

599
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:25,077
- Are you free?
- Of course.

600
00:42:25,177 --> 00:42:29,581
天蝎座！天蝎座！天蝎座！

600
00:42:25,177 --> 00:42:29,581
Scorpus! Scorpus! Scorpus!

601
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,119
把鲁弗斯在蓝派的股份给我

601
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,119
Give me Rufus's shares
in the Blue Faction.

602
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:47,900
我们的耐心得到了回报。

602
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:47,900
Our patience has paid off.

603
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:58,210
- 等我一下- 是的天蝎座

603
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:58,210
- Give me a moment.
- Yes, Scorpus.

604
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,094
休息，

604
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,094
Rest,

605
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:17,931
在我的朋友埃莱加宝的怀里。

605
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:17,931
in the arms of
Elegabal, my friend.

606
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,045
你只是运气好。

606
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,045
You just got lucky.

607
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:34,713
运气是游戏的一部分。

607
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:34,713
Luck is part of the game.

608
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:46,425
柯克死了我又赢了一次

608
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:46,425
Kirko is dead and
another victory for me.

609
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:47,659
我该笑还是该哭？

609
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:47,659
Shall I laugh or cry?

610
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,228
- 把我的酒拿来。- 是的天蝎座

610
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,228
- Get my wine.
- Yes, Scorpus.

611
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:51,364
我们把哀悼留给别人吧。

611
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:51,364
Let's leave the
mourning to others.

612
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:53,565
我们应该庆祝一下。

612
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:53,565
We should celebrate.

613
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:55,402
那是什麽？

613
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:55,402
What is that?

614
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:58,237
财富，地位，权力，

614
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:58,237
Wealth, position, power,

615
00:43:59,072 --> 00:44:00,172
和尊重

615
00:43:59,072 --> 00:44:00,172
and respect.

616
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:01,675
全在那里面？

616
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:01,675
All in that?

617
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:04,710
五百股蓝色阵营的股票。

617
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:04,710
500 shares of the Blue Faction.

618
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,445
啊，又来了...再

618
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,445
Ah, here we go... again.

619
00:44:06,545 --> 00:44:10,949
一个新的派系由一个卑微的平民贫民窟罪犯拥有。

619
00:44:06,545 --> 00:44:10,949
A new faction owned by a
lowly, plebeian slumlord criminal.

620
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,818
- 无意冒犯- 没关系

620
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,818
- No offense.
- None taken.

621
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:15,889
一个天才的醉酒司机，

621
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:15,889
And a gifted drunken driver,

622
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:18,625
他既富有又受人尊敬

622
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:18,625
who has wealth and respect,

623
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:20,960
对权力和地位毫不在乎

623
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:20,960
and doesn't give a shit
about power or position.

624
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:24,030
无意冒犯，没关系。

624
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:24,030
No offense, none taken.

625
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:27,233
你不明白这意味着什么吗？

625
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:27,233
Don't you see what this means?

626
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,302
我把这些卖给出价最高的人

626
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,302
I sell these to
the highest bidder

627
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,771
我们就有足够的钱成立自己的派系

627
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,771
and we have enough
to start our own faction.

628
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,041
四个派系已经存在了几百年。

628
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,041
Four factions have existed
for hundreds of years.

629
00:44:35,141 --> 00:44:37,443
贵族拥有它们。不是你和我这样的人。

629
00:44:35,141 --> 00:44:37,443
Patricians own them. Not
the likes of you and me.

630
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:38,577
在这些日子里，

630
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:38,577
In these days,

631
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:40,480
什么事都有可能发生

631
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:40,480
anything can happen.

632
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:42,382
大家起立

632
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:42,382
Men rise.

633
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:46,219
我们的皇帝出身于一个养骡的家庭。

633
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:46,219
Our emperor is from a
family of mule breeders.

634
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,322
总有一天，像我们这样的平民也会统治这座城市。

634
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,322
One day, even plebeians
like us might rule this city.

635
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,025
当然了

635
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,025
No, of course.

636
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:54,460
我会成为神

636
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:54,460
And, uh, I will become a god.

637
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:59,164
不天蝎座需要喝一杯

637
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:59,164
No, Scorpus needs a drink.

638
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:13,346
你哥哥今天做得很好，你没有。

638
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:13,346
Your brother did well
today, you did not.

639
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:16,648
为了确保我们的公民不会饿死，

639
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:16,648
To make sure our citizens
do not starve to death,

640
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,217
或者站起来割断我们的喉咙

640
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,217
or rise up and cut our throats,

641
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:21,855
你的责任是保证我们的粮食供应。

641
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:21,855
your responsibility is to
ensure our grain supply.

642
00:45:21,954 --> 00:45:24,123
风暴，或者没有风暴。

642
00:45:21,954 --> 00:45:24,123
Storms, or no storms.

643
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,192
我不能控制风和潮汐。

643
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,192
I cannot control the
winds or the tides.

644
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:29,228
那你应该体谅他们，不是吗？

644
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:29,228
Then you should make
allowances for them, should you not?

645
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:31,231
- 是吗-是的

645
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:31,231
Yes?

646
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,034
你玩忽职守

646
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,034
You neglect your duty

647
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:38,271
睡在你床上的犹太女王

647
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:38,271
for that Judean Queen
who sleeps in your bed.

648
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:42,842
我告诉过你把她送走，但她还是睡在你的床上。

648
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:42,842
I told you to send her away,
but she still sleeps in your bed.

649
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:45,344
我想知道为什么。

649
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:45,344
I wonder why.

650
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:51,251
我来牵你的马。

650
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:51,251
Here, let me take your horse.

651
00:45:52,952 --> 00:45:54,353
我的王后

651
00:45:52,952 --> 00:45:54,353
My queen.

652
00:45:55,221 --> 00:45:57,923
我来这里太鲁莽了。

652
00:45:55,221 --> 00:45:57,923
It was reckless coming here.

653
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:04,530
我们的敌人认为她对你的影响太大了，

653
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:04,530
Our enemies think she has
too much influence on you,

654
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,132
我也这么想

654
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,132
and I think the same.

655
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:09,068
我打败了犹太人，

655
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:09,068
I defeated the Judeans,

656
00:46:09,168 --> 00:46:11,237
把她和她的八万族人带到了罗马

656
00:46:09,168 --> 00:46:11,237
brought her and 80,000
of her people to Rome

657
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,440
建造我们的竞技场。

657
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,440
to build our arena.

658
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:16,076
她和我同床并不代表她有影响力，

658
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:16,076
Having her in my bed is
not a mark of her influence,

659
00:46:16,175 --> 00:46:19,244
这是他们失败和屈服的标志

659
00:46:16,175 --> 00:46:19,244
it's a mark of their
defeat and submission.

660
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:21,047
他们还让孩子们超负荷工作吗？

660
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:21,047
Do they still
overwork the children?

661
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:23,717
因为你求情了，所以好多了。

661
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:23,717
It is better since
you interceded.

662
00:46:23,817 --> 00:46:24,983
食物分配呢

662
00:46:23,817 --> 00:46:24,983
And the food allotment?

663
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:26,385
还是不够

663
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:26,385
Still insufficient.

664
00:46:26,485 --> 00:46:28,320
罗马人自己也不够。

664
00:46:26,485 --> 00:46:28,320
The Romans themselves
don't have enough.

665
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,155
我们得到的所剩无几。

665
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,155
We get what's
left of very little.

666
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,826
你会为我们的被剥夺辩护

666
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:32,826
You would justify
our deprivation.

667
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:35,628
不，我只是想解释一下。

667
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:35,628
No, I only seek to explain it.

668
00:46:35,728 --> 00:46:39,833
你的罗马将军怎么想

668
00:46:35,728 --> 00:46:39,833
And what does your
Roman general think

669
00:46:39,932 --> 00:46:41,233
关于我们被剥夺的权利

669
00:46:39,932 --> 00:46:41,233
about our deprivation?

670
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,436
不管怎样，你都违背了我。

670
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,436
In either case,
you disobeyed me.

671
00:46:43,936 --> 00:46:45,605
好吧，等我当上皇帝，

671
00:46:43,936 --> 00:46:45,605
Well, when I am emperor,

672
00:46:45,704 --> 00:46:47,507
我得自己做决定。

672
00:46:45,704 --> 00:46:47,507
I will have to make
my own decisions.

673
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:49,943
不是什么时候，是如果！

673
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:49,943
Not when, if!

674
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,211
如果.

674
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,211
If.

675
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,782
不久我将渡过冥河

675
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,782
Soon I shall cross
the River Styx

676
00:46:56,882 --> 00:46:58,952
黑暗王国

676
00:46:56,882 --> 00:46:58,952
to the Kingdom of Darkness,

677
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:01,454
在此之前我得做个决定

677
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:01,454
and before I do, I have
a decision to make.

678
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:03,222
凯撒大帝

678
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:03,222
Julius Caesar

679
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,025
有这样一个选择，

679
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,025
had such a choice,

680
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,460
他选择了年轻的政治家屋大维

680
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,460
and he chose Octavian,
the young politician,

681
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:11,097
而不是那个士兵马克安东尼

681
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:11,097
over Mark Antony, the soldier.

682
00:47:11,197 --> 00:47:12,599
结果是这样的，

682
00:47:11,197 --> 00:47:12,599
And the result was this,

683
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:14,699
我们的帝国

683
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:14,699
our empire.

684
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:19,239
我宁愿选择士兵，

684
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:19,239
Now, I would rather
choose the soldier,

685
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:21,041
但我会选择

685
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:21,041
but I will choose

686
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:24,476
我认为对罗马最好的人

686
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:24,476
whoever I believe
will be best for Rome.

687
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,545
你明白我的意思吗？

687
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,545
Do you understand me?

688
00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:32,351
好.把那个犹太女人赶走。

688
00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:32,351
Good. And send the
Judean woman away.

689
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:35,889
我会考虑的

689
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:35,889
I will consider it.

690
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:43,730
女王陛下，快。我们得走了

690
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:43,730
My queen, quickly.
We must leave.

691
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,431
提图斯在路上了

691
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,431
Titus is on his way.

692
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:58,378
来吧来吧

692
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:58,378
Come on. Come on.

693
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:01,648
快点.快点.

693
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:01,648
Hurry. Hurry.

694
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:05,050
就这样了？

694
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:05,050
This is it?

695
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:18,965
没事没事这将是...

695
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:18,965
It's fine, it's fine.
It's going to be...

696
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:20,333
一切都会好起来的

696
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:20,333
It's going to be fine.

697
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:22,668
我的姐妹篇们。

697
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:22,668
My sisters.

698
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:25,014
- 夸梅- 你在这里干什么？

698
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:25,014
- Kwame!
- What are you doing here?

699
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:26,572
- 是我的错我- 不，是我的。

699
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:26,572
- It's my fault.
- No, it's mine.

700
00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:29,576
- 我杀了一个罗马军团士兵。- 她在保护我。

700
00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:29,576
- I killed a Roman legionary.
- She was protecting me.

701
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:31,378
快点，这边。

701
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:31,378
Quickly, this way.

702
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:33,880
你在那里！快点！抓住他！嘿，士兵。

702
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:33,880
You there! Quick!
Catch him! Hey, soldier.

703
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:38,751
- 不，住手！- 来吧

703
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:38,751
- No, stop it!
- Come on.

704
00:48:38,851 --> 00:48:41,721
- 你在干什么？- 这是一个错误，先生。

704
00:48:38,851 --> 00:48:41,721
- What's going on?
- This is a mistake, sir.

705
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:43,322
她们是我的姐妹篇。

705
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:43,322
They are my sisters.

706
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,125
她是在保护小家伙。

706
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,125
She was protecting
the little one.

707
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:46,960
这是极不公平的。

707
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:46,960
This is most unjust.

708
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:48,061
我为你打猎。

708
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:48,061
I hunt for you.

709
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:50,396
我为你们罗马人服务。

709
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:50,396
I serve you Romans.

710
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:51,764
把他也带来。

710
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:51,764
Bring him as well.

711
00:48:51,864 --> 00:48:52,998
不，不，不！

711
00:48:51,864 --> 00:48:52,998
No, no, no!

712
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:00,974
请原谅我女王身体不适。

712
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:00,974
Forgive me, please.
The queen is indisposed.

713
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:03,043
- 不舒服？- 是的

713
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:03,043
- Indisposed?
- Yes.

714
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:18,123
有什么事吗

714
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:18,123
Is there something?

715
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:21,594
我想为你展现最好的一面。

715
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:21,594
I wanted to look
my best for you.

716
00:49:22,862 --> 00:49:24,063
你先出去

716
00:49:22,862 --> 00:49:24,063
Leave us.

717
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:33,239
我当指挥官太久了

717
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:33,239
I am too long a commander

718
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,041
哪怕是皇帝的命令

718
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,041
for bristled orders,
even from an emperor.

719
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,610
他给你下了什么命令？

719
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:37,610
And what orders
did he have for you?

720
00:49:38,677 --> 00:49:40,347
他让我把你送走。

720
00:49:38,677 --> 00:49:40,347
He told me to send you away.

721
00:49:42,282 --> 00:49:44,016
他说你有损我的尊严，

721
00:49:42,282 --> 00:49:44,016
He says you
diminish my dignitas,

722
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,452
和家庭的责任

722
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,452
and that of the family.

723
00:49:45,552 --> 00:49:47,320
他最好让他的儿子和继承人

723
00:49:45,552 --> 00:49:47,320
He would do better to
grant his son and heir

724
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,556
自己做决定的权利

724
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,556
the right to make
his own decisions.

725
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:50,657
自己...

725
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:50,657
Myself...

726
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:53,826
或者图密善

726
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:53,826
or Domitian.

727
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:58,364
他威胁要选择图密善？

727
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:58,364
He threatened to
choose Domitian?

728
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:00,632
不是很明确，但是...

728
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:00,632
Not in so many words, but...

729
00:50:01,467 --> 00:50:03,202
那你必须把我送走

729
00:50:01,467 --> 00:50:03,202
Then you must send me away.

730
00:50:03,302 --> 00:50:04,302
号

730
00:50:03,302 --> 00:50:04,302
No.

731
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:06,405
你父亲横跨世界

731
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:06,405
Your father sits
astride the world

732
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:08,775
你哥哥在他耳边低语

732
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:08,775
and your brother
whispers in his ear.

733
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,411
如果他们想切掉你的蛋蛋，

733
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,411
If they seek to
cut off your balls,

734
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:14,646
我不会是那个把刀递给他们的人。

734
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:14,646
I will not be the one
to hand them the knife.

735
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:20,652
把我送走。

735
00:50:19,251 --> 00:50:20,652
Send me away.

736
00:50:47,112 --> 00:50:48,114
去矿场。

736
00:50:47,112 --> 00:50:48,114
To the mines.

737
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:54,753
那些是锡矿的

737
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:54,753
Those for the tin mines.

738
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:58,858
竞技场的那两个。

738
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:58,858
Those two for the arena.

739
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,427
快这边

739
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,427
Quick. This way.

740
00:51:01,927 --> 00:51:04,130
我需要更多的战士。

740
00:51:01,927 --> 00:51:04,130
I need more of those, fighters.

741
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,432
角斗士，强壮的男人。

741
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,432
Gladiators, strong men.

742
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:09,469
他们在罗马建的这个新竞技场，

742
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:09,469
This new arena
they built in Rome,

743
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:13,505
他们是一条血河，我们是一片金钱的海洋。

743
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:13,505
a river of blood for them,
an ocean of money for us.

744
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:15,742
去矿场。

744
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:15,742
To the mines.

745
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:19,945
- 茱拉- 母亲

745
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:19,945
- Jula.
- Mother.

746
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,282
去锡矿。

746
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,282
To the tin mines.

747
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:25,050
儿子，告诉我这是个严重的错误。

747
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:25,050
Son, tell me this
is a terrible mistake.

748
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,253
- 对不起妈妈- 怎么会这样？

748
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,253
- I'm sorry, Mother.
- How did this happen?

749
00:51:27,353 --> 00:51:28,463
他们不知道你为他们工作吗？

749
00:51:27,353 --> 00:51:28,463
Don't they know
you work for them?

750
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,489
我试着解救我的姐妹篇们。

750
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,489
I tried to free my sisters.

751
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:34,126
- 你这个愚蠢的孩子。- 去矿场。

751
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:34,126
- You foolish, foolish boy.
- To the mines.

752
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:36,695
也许有一个办法

752
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:36,695
Maybe there is one way.

753
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:38,431
那个人正在整理

753
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:38,431
That man is sorting out

754
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,733
他们将作为角斗士被带到罗马

754
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,733
who will be taken to
Rome as gladiators

755
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:44,003
他将被派往克里特岛的锡矿。

755
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:44,003
and who will be sent
to the tin mines of Crete.

756
00:51:44,103 --> 00:51:45,538
锡矿是什么？

756
00:51:44,103 --> 00:51:45,538
What is the tin mines?

757
00:51:45,637 --> 00:51:47,206
死刑。

757
00:51:45,637 --> 00:51:47,206
A death sentence.

758
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:49,708
向他们展示你的战斗力。

758
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:49,708
Show them you can fight.

759
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,244
向阿佩德马克祈祷

759
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,244
And pray to Apedemak.

760
00:51:52,378 --> 00:51:53,947
他们是巨人。

760
00:51:52,378 --> 00:51:53,947
Those men are giants.

761
00:51:54,514 --> 00:51:56,615
我见识过你的能力。

761
00:51:54,514 --> 00:51:56,615
I've seen what you can do.

762
00:51:58,751 --> 00:52:01,920
让狮子的心在你胸膛里咆哮。

762
00:51:58,751 --> 00:52:01,920
Let a lion's heart
roar in your chest.

763
00:52:03,255 --> 00:52:05,525
给他们看，不然就死定了。

763
00:52:03,255 --> 00:52:05,525
Show them or die trying.

764
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:09,161
朱拉和奥拉呢？

764
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:09,161
What of Jula and Aura?

765
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:10,429
你的姐妹篇们也是。

765
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:10,429
Your sisters as well.

766
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,364
- 你们都得去罗马。- 怎么做？

766
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,364
- You must all go to Rome.
- How?

767
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:14,233
- 女人，出去！- 战斗.

767
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:14,233
- Woman, out!
- Fight.

768
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:17,202
- 你比你知道的要坚强。- 去矿场。

768
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:17,202
- You are stronger than you know.
- To the mines.

769
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:21,775
太短太小了。去矿场。

769
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:21,775
Too short and too
small. To the mines.

770
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:30,983
让他们战斗。

770
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:30,983
Let them fight.

771
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:52,905
停下来！

771
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:52,905
Stop!

772
00:52:54,407 --> 00:52:55,942
我看够了

772
00:52:54,407 --> 00:52:55,942
I've seen enough.

773
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,715
你在找竞技场，是吗？

773
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,715
You seek the arena, do you?

774
00:53:02,815 --> 00:53:06,353
- 带他来- 如果我的姐妹篇们也来的话。

774
00:53:02,815 --> 00:53:06,353
- Bring him.
- Only if my sisters come as well.

775
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:09,556
奴隶提出要求。

775
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:09,556
A slave who makes demands.

776
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:12,092
把他带来。

776
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:12,092
Just bring him.

777
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:14,994
那我就割断自己的喉咙

777
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:14,994
Then I will slit my own throat

778
00:53:15,094 --> 00:53:16,862
我就不会这么做

778
00:53:15,094 --> 00:53:16,862
the moment I am given a weapon.

779
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:19,666
带我看看你的姐妹篇们。

779
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:19,666
Show me your sisters.

780
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:27,907
啊

780
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:27,907
Ah.

781
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:31,744
在罗马的某个老色鬼那里能卖个好价钱。

781
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:31,744
They will fetch a good price
from some old lecher in Rome.

782
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:33,380
把他们也带来。

782
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:33,380
Bring them as well.

783
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,648
来了

783
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,648
Come.

784
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:44,367
- 回家吧管好我的事。- 你打算怎么办？

784
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:44,367
- Go home. Tend my business.
- What are you going to do?

785
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:46,760
奴隶是可以买的。

785
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:46,760
Slaves can be bought.

786
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,730
他们可以被买回来。

786
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,730
And they can be bought back.
