1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,480
前情提要

1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,480
Previously on
Those About to Die...

2
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,388
你在找竞技场，是吗？

2
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,388
You seek the arena, do you?

3
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,858
- 来了- 只是想卖我们的安达卢西亚人。

3
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,858
- Come.
- Just looking to sell our Andalusians.

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,160
比赛结束后我会和芬布里亚谈谈。

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,160
I'll speak to Fimbria
after the race.

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,396
你哥哥今天做得很好，你没有。

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,396
Your brother did well
today, you did not.

6
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:31,564
你玩忽职守

6
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:31,564
You neglect your duty

7
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,801
睡在你床上的犹太女王

7
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,801
for that Judean queen
who sleeps in your bed.

8
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,170
- 你妻子的股份？- 那是什麽？

8
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,170
- Your wife's shares?
- What is that?

9
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,204
财富，地位，权力。

9
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,204
Wealth, position, power.

10
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:40,840
五百股蓝色阵营的股票。

10
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:40,840
500 shares of the Blue Faction.

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,509
为什么柯克的战车会散架？

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,509
Why did Kirko's
chariot fell apart?

12
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:49,808
你可以走了

12
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:49,808
You can leave.

13
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,715
诸神在上

13
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,715
By the Gods...

14
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,384
你在干什麽？

14
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,384
What are you doing?

15
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,353
你想干什么？

15
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,353
What do you want?

16
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,360
- 这是什麽？- 一个开口销，切到一半。

16
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,360
- What's this?
- One cotter pin, cut halfway through.

17
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,328
我的赛车搭档死了。

17
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,328
My racing partner is dead.

18
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,697
如果我没换装备的话我会的。

18
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,697
And I would be if I
hadn't switched rigs.

19
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,501
这是你的补救措施吗

19
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,501
Is this one of your fixes?

20
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,472
天蝎座输了，你就赚大钱。

20
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,472
Scorpus loses, you collect big.

21
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,040
我摔断了几根骨头或者脖子，让它看起来像真实的。

21
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,040
I break a few bones or my
neck, to make it look real.

22
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,842
当然不是

22
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,842
No, of course it's not.

23
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,478
我告诉过你，我对我们俩有更大的计划

23
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,478
I told you, I have much
bigger plans for the both of us

24
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,879
而不是几场作弊的比赛

24
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,879
than a few more rigged races.

25
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,716
那就查出是谁破坏了我的装备

25
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,716
Then find out who
sabotaged my rig,

26
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,251
杀了他们

26
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,251
and kill them.

27
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:42,655
哦...

27
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:42,655
Oh...

28
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,356
不错啊

28
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,356
Nice.

29
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,526
看起来就像我的马，因西塔斯。

29
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,526
Looks just like my
horse, Incitatus.

30
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,329
走了从今天开始拿走你的奖金。

30
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,329
Go. And take your
winnings from today.

31
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,670
别把我当回事

31
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,670
Don't take me for granted.

32
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,737
我不知道

32
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,737
I don't.

33
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,699
是的好孩子

33
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,699
Yes. Good boy.

34
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,605
你怎么认识安达卢西亚人的？

34
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,605
How do you know Andalusians?

35
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:41,173
我开车送他们来的。很久以前的事了

35
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:41,173
I drove them. A long time ago.

36
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:42,574
你比赛了？

36
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:42,574
You raced?

37
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,980
嗯，没有马能和我们的安达卢西亚马匹敌。

37
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,980
Well, there are no horses out
there to equal our Andalusians.

38
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:48,615
他们怎么样？

38
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:48,615
How are they?

39
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,117
索纳和西斯塔的腿被碎片切掉了。

39
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,117
Sorna and Sista got their
legs cut from the debris.

40
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,786
我们得让他们休息一周。

40
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,786
We'll have to rest
them for a week.

41
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,423
安达卢西亚人？

41
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,423
Andalusians, huh?

42
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,259
- 是的- 哈你

42
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,259
- Yes.
- Huh.

43
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,495
加夫罗斯对安达卢西亚人评价很高，我认为他们是猪。

43
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,495
Gavros has a high opinion of
Andalusians, I think they're pigs.

44
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,166
他们比你的海湾更快，更坚固，更灵活。

44
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,166
They're faster than your
Bays, sturdier, and more nimble.

45
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,903
如果他们是猪，那你的海湾是什么？

45
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,903
If they're pigs, what does
that make your Bays?

46
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,504
听听这孩子说的。他让你想起了谁？

46
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,504
Listen to the boy. Who
does he remind you of?

47
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,940
我想的是我，但现在...

47
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,940
I was thinking me, but now...

48
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:16,675
我在想你。

48
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:16,675
I'm thinking you.

49
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,745
明天下午，

49
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,745
Tomorrow afternoon,

50
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,714
我去看看你的安达卢西亚人。

50
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,714
I'll take a look at
your Andalusians.

51
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,983
加弗罗斯

51
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,983
Gavros!

52
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,553
你哥哥很会说话。

52
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,553
Your brother has
a way with words.

53
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,632
明天下午你要为天蝎座赛马。

53
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,632
Your running your horse for
Scorpus tomorrow afternoon.

54
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,696
干得好，弟弟。

54
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,696
Well done, little brother.

55
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,726
想象一下我们的马在罗马为蓝军效力。

55
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,726
Imagine our horse is
running for the Blues in Rome.

56
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,793
你住在哪里？

56
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,793
Where do you stay?

57
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,697
我知道一个地方。跟我来

57
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,697
I know a place. Follow me.

58
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,473
Tenax的人。

58
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,473
One of Tenax's.

59
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,843
这一个比其他的害虫少。

59
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,843
This one has fewer
vermin than the others.

60
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,615
Tenax是谁？

60
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,615
Who's Tenax?

61
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,985
你很快就会知道了。

61
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,985
You'll find out soon enough.

62
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,459
谢谢你加弗罗斯

62
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,459
Thank you, Gavros.

63
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,002
一个月九个塞斯特斯。

63
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,002
Nine sesterces a month.

64
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,670
每个.

64
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,670
Each.

65
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,605
我只有两个。

65
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,605
I only have two.

66
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,007
你把钱花在什么地方了？

66
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,007
What did you spend it on?

67
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,053
你在床上待的时间已经够长了，方索阿。

67
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,053
You've already spent
enough time in a bed, Fonsoa.

68
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,555
现在你发言

68
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,555
Now, you get the floor.

69
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,045
怎么回事？

69
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,045
What's happening?

70
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,817
- 爸爸！- 不不求你了

70
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,817
- Papa!
- No, no, please!

71
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,699
谁让你这么做的

71
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,699
Who told you to do this?

72
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,769
不是我干的。泰纳克斯，拜托。相信我

72
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,769
I didn't do it. Tenax,
please. Believe me.

73
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,305
所以比起我你更害怕那个人。

73
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,305
So you're more afraid of
whoever it was than you are of me.

74
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,574
不求你了求你了我对此一无所知。

74
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,574
No, please, please. I
know nothing about this.

75
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,643
相信我，求你了...

75
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,643
Believe me, please...

76
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,111
你太让我失望了

76
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,111
You disappoint me.

77
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,313
- 不！不！不！不，不，不！- 我知道是谁

77
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,313
- No! No, no, no!
- I know who!

78
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:37,283
他有一头红发，当时他在商店里。

78
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:37,283
He had red hair and
he was in the shop.

79
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,719
他说这是给你的惊喜，爸爸。

79
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,719
He said it was a
surprise for you, Papa.

80
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,020
说这是个秘密

80
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,020
Said it was a secret.

81
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,024
你真走运

81
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,024
Lucky you.

82
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,096
是的，我会的

82
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,096
Yes!

83
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,700
今天是你的大日子，对吧？

83
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,700
It's your day, yeah?

84
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,110
你刚来罗马，对吧？

84
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,110
You're new to Rome, yes?

85
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,178
你是谁？

85
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,178
Who are you?

86
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,715
我是Tenax

86
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,715
I'm Tenax.

87
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,850
问问周围的人

87
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,850
Ask around.

88
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,886
人们会建议你对我有礼貌。

88
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,886
People will suggest
you be polite to me.

89
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,155
你想干什么？

89
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,155
What do you want?

90
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,625
这里的规矩是

90
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,625
The way things work
around here is that

91
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:22,162
在你搞战车比赛之前

91
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:22,162
before you fuck
with a chariot race,

92
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,897
你好好问我。

92
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,897
you ask me nicely.

93
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,899
如果你想用一种可能会杀死

93
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,899
And if you want to do
it in a way that might kill

94
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,201
他是罗马最有价值的车夫

94
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,201
the most valuable
charioteer in Rome

95
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,135
他碰巧是我的朋友

95
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,135
who happens to be my friend,

96
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,873
那我会拒绝

96
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,873
then I'd say no.

97
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,975
我就割了你的蛋蛋。

97
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,975
And I'd cut off your balls.

98
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:42,782
你叫什么名字？

98
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:42,782
Your name again?

99
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,889
Tenax

99
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,889
Tenax.

100
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,923
我听说过你

100
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,923
I heard of you.

101
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,427
你在你的小世界里很强大。

101
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,427
You're very powerful
in your little world.

102
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,395
雇我的人

102
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,395
The person who hired me

103
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,265
来自一个更大的世界

103
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,265
is from a much,
much bigger world.

104
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,779
也许这个人会保护你。

104
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,779
Perhaps this person
will protect you.

105
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:18,985
再说吧

105
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:18,985
We'll see.

106
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,261
走吧卢修斯

106
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,261
Come on, Lucius.

107
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,332
他甚至没有站起来。

107
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,332
He didn't even stand up.

108
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:34,900
你应该杀了他。

108
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:34,900
You should have killed him.

109
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,001
我会的

109
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,001
I will.

110
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,471
首先，我得处理雇他的人。

110
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,471
First, I have to deal with
the one who hired him.

111
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,740
我们要怎么找出是谁？

111
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,740
How do we find out who it was?

112
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,207
他刚告诉我的。

112
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,207
He just told me.

113
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,326
我不会送你走的

113
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,326
I will not send you away.

114
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,929
但你必须这么做

114
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,929
But you must.

115
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,066
我很快就要当皇帝了

115
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,066
I'll be Emperor soon.

116
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,835
没有人会挑战我。

116
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,835
No one will challenge me.

117
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,138
如果你哥哥坐上了教长之位，那我和我的人民怎么办？

117
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,138
If your brother takes the curule
chair, what then of me and my people?

118
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,975
没有什么比

118
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,975
Nothing would
delight him more than

119
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,878
让他的竞技场充满了我们的鲜血

119
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,878
filling his arena
with our blood.

120
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,980
不是他的

120
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,980
It's not his.

121
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,216
是罗马的。

121
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,216
It's Rome's.

122
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,152
是我的

122
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,152
It's mine.

123
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,323
待在这

123
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,323
Stay here.

124
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,192
在罗马。

124
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,192
In Rome.

125
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,894
你们两个出去

125
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,894
You two, out.

126
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:16,101
你杀了那个想杀我的小混蛋吗

126
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:16,101
Did you kill the little
shit who tried to kill me?

127
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,504
不完全是

127
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,504
Not exactly.

128
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,373
图密善下令破坏你的战车。

128
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,373
It was Domitian who ordered
your chariot sabotaged.

129
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,142
图密善？

129
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,142
Domitian?

130
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,043
他为什么要我死？

130
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,043
Why would he want me dead?

131
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,879
他只是需要点钱，所以他...

131
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,879
He just needed
some money, so he...

132
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,014
增加了一点胜算

132
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,014
nudged the odds a bit.

133
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,883
为什么图密善需要钱？

133
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,883
Why would Domitian need money?

134
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,451
他的家族统治着整个世界。

134
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,451
His family rule
the fucking world.

135
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,985
是也不是

135
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,985
Yes and no.

136
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,854
他父亲把他管得很严。

136
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,854
His father keeps
him on a tight leash.

137
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,190
他是两个儿子中最小的一个。

137
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,190
Remember, he is the
lesser of the two sons.

138
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:40,159
他必须非常小心地对待他父亲。

138
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:40,159
He has to tread very
carefully with his father.

139
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:44,063
他欠了罗马各地赌场几百万。

139
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:44,063
He owes millions to betting
taverns all over Rome.

140
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,265
告诉我们他有多绝望。

140
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,265
Which tell us just how
desperate he's become.

141
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,835
这是好消息，真的。

141
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,835
It's good news, really.

142
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,038
这是我们需要的最后一块拼图

142
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,038
This is the final piece
of the puzzle we need

143
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,405
得到我们的派系

143
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,405
to get our faction.

144
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,274
- 你说什么？怎么做？

144
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,274
What? How?

145
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,275
好吧...

145
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,275
Well...

146
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,477
你是我们历史上最好的车手

146
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,477
in you, we have the
best driver in history.

147
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,148
- 同意了- 当我卖掉蓝色的股份时

147
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,148
- Agreed.
- And when I sell the shares in the Blue,

148
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,183
我们就有足够的资金来建立自己的派系

148
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,183
we'll have enough to
fund our own faction.

149
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,552
那么我们只需要得到许可

149
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,552
Then, all we need is permission

150
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,221
从市政厅卢迪，

150
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,221
from the Aedile Ludi,

151
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,623
游戏之王，谁是？

151
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,623
Master of the Games,
who happens to be?

152
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,927
贵族，但是穷

152
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,927
The noble, but skint

153
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,062
图密善，皇帝的儿子。

153
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,062
Domitian, son of the Emperor.

154
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,466
是的，我会的

154
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,466
Yes!

155
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,017
这就是奴隶的下场

155
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,017
That's what happens to slaves

156
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,184
当他们不接受命运的时候

156
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,184
when they don't
accept their fate.

157
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,179
拿着

157
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,179
Take them.

158
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,652
- 不！不！不！- 夸梅

158
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,652
- No!
- Kwame.

159
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,453
看着我坚强点

159
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,453
Look at me. Be strong.

160
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,456
坚强点

160
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,456
Be strong.

161
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,956
- 坚强点- 救命啊！

161
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,956
- Be strong.
- Help!

162
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,359
奥拉，照顾好她！

162
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,359
Aura, look after her!

163
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,231
夸梅不！不！不！不！不！不！

163
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,231
Kwame! No! No!

164
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,235
不！不！不！

164
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,235
No!

165
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,415
法里德

165
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,415
Ah, Farid.

166
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,485
你有什么要给我的？

166
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,485
What do you have for me?

167
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,388
好好欣赏吧。

167
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,388
Feast your eyes.

168
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,961
上帝保佑

168
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,961
By the Gods.

169
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,663
我听说过这样的野兽，但认为它们是虚构的。

169
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,663
I've heard of such beasts, but
thought they were imaginary.

170
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:02,201
他是真实的。你要为他付真实的钱。

170
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:02,201
Oh, he's real. And you're
going to pay real money for him.

171
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,403
他在抓捕过程中杀了两个人，

171
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,403
He killed two men in the taking,

172
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,240
并在运输过程中撕裂了另一个

172
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,240
and ripped apart another
during the transport.

173
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,676
好吧，我完蛋了。

173
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,676
Well, I'm done for.

174
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,610
我已经喜欢上他了。

174
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,610
I like him already.

175
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,450
他是谁？

175
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,450
Who is he?

176
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,153
夸梅，抓他的人。

176
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,153
Kwame, his captor.

177
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,590
他害怕野兽受到恶魔的保护。

177
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,590
He fears the beast is
protected by demons.

178
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,193
我害怕爪子和牙齿。

178
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,193
I fear claws and teeth.

179
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,062
不是魔法。

179
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,062
Not magic.

180
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,200
你应该两个都害怕。

180
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,200
You should fear both.

181
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,226
四百

181
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,226
Four hundred.

182
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,663
五

182
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,663
Five.

183
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,460
稍等

183
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,460
One moment.

184
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,301
一些努米底亚人正在出售珍珠。

184
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,301
Some Numidian is selling pearls.

185
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,635
啊

185
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,635
Ah.

186
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,379
新买的奴隶，会被带到哪里去？

186
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,379
Newly bought slaves,
where would they be taken?

187
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,217
你好

187
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,217
Salam.

188
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,215
你有多少珍珠？

188
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,215
How many pearls do you have?

189
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,551
你卖了那辆车赚的钱呢？

189
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,551
And the money you got
from the one you sold?

190
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,223
她还能有什么？

190
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,223
What else might she have?

191
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,826
你看不出来吗？

191
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,826
Can't you see?

192
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,398
嘘！走！

192
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,398
Psst! Go!

193
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,323
想想我哥哥要把他从塔佩岩上扔下去。

193
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,323
And to think my brother were to
throw him from the Tarpeian Rock.

194
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,395
那会是多么的浪费啊。

194
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,395
What a waste that
would have been.

195
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,534
- 弗拉玛- 弗拉维乌斯·多米提亚努斯

195
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,534
- Flamma.
- Flavius Domitianus.

196
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,368
他们还喂得好吗？

196
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,368
Are they still feeding you well?

197
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,804
是的

197
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,804
Yes.

198
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,471
- 女人？- 我选。

198
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,471
- Women?
- My pick.

199
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,840
在每月的卡伦德和伊德斯。

199
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,840
On the Kalends and
the Ides of each month.

200
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,542
好.

200
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,542
Good.

201
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,380
新来的。

201
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,380
New arrivals.

202
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,423
好.

202
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,423
Good.

203
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,492
好.

203
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,492
Good.

204
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,365
太轻了。即使是退休人员。

204
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,365
Too light. Even for Retiarius.

205
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,700
我见过他打架。

205
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,700
I've seen him fight.

206
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,201
他很快。

206
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,201
He's fast.

207
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,704
据说他赤手空拳杀死了一头狮子。

207
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,704
He's said to have killed
a lion with his bare hands.

208
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,807
赤手空拳？

208
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,807
With his bare hands?

209
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,814
我想看看你能做什么。

209
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,814
I'd like to see what you can do.

210
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:44,718
把他和这个放在一起。

210
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:44,718
Put him with this one.

211
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,586
维果

211
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,586
Viggo.

212
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,598
中等系绳。

212
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,598
Medium tether.

213
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,476
他不能这么做。

213
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,476
He's not allowed to do that.

214
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,011
一把短剑。

214
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,011
A gladius.

215
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,904
停下来！

215
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,904
Stop!

216
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,540
别说了

216
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,540
Stop.

217
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,846
原谅我，弗拉维乌斯·多米提亚努斯。

217
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,846
Forgive me, Flavius Domitianus.

218
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,214
Viggo有追随者。

218
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,214
Viggo has a following.

219
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:58,718
让弗拉玛在众人面前杀了他不是更好吗

219
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:58,718
Isn't it perhaps better to let
Flamma kill him before a crowd?

220
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,720
很好.

220
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,720
Very well.

221
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,990
一头狮子。没有武器。

221
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,990
A lion. Without a weapon.

222
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,961
当然是谎言。但很大胆。

222
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,961
A lie, of course.
But a bold one.

223
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,664
北非充满了肮脏的害虫和狗，

223
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,664
North Africa, filled with
filthy vermin and dogs,

224
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,800
被我威严的父亲安抚

224
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,800
pacified by my august father.

225
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,704
不过，谢天谢地，没有太多的安抚。

225
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,704
But, thankfully, not
pacified too much.

226
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,006
告诉我

226
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,006
So, tell me.

227
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,442
你赤手空拳能杀死什么？

227
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,442
What could you kill
with you bare hands?

228
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,744
克制！

228
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,744
Restrain!

229
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,983
买下他我们要好好表现他的死。

229
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,983
Buy him. We'll make a
good show of his death.

230
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,752
跟我

230
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,752
With me.

231
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,740
他在哪里？

231
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,740
Where is he?

232
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,009
别担心他会来的

232
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,009
Don't worry. He'll be here.

233
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,944
他来了

233
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,944
Here he comes.

234
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,923
对安达卢西亚人来说太小了。

234
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,923
They're small for Andalusians.

235
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,727
马跑得快不是因为它们的体型。

235
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,727
It is not their size
that makes horses fast.

236
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,730
没有鞭子。他们没有它跑得更好。

236
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,730
And no whip. They
run better without it.

237
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,176
啊！

237
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,176
Yah!

238
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:48,894
开球开球

238
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:48,894
Hut, hut, hut.

239
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,798
哇哦

239
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,798
Whoa.

240
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,465
他们很快。

240
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,465
They're fast.

241
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,807
喔。

241
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,807
Whoo.

242
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,476
啊！

242
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,476
Yah!

243
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,728
- 是的，在这里，你...... - 嘿！嘿！

243
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,728
- Yes, here, you...
- Hey!

244
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,530
你考虑过我的提议了吗

244
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,530
Have you thought about my offer?

245
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:25,865
是的，我有。

245
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:25,865
Yes, I have.

246
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,734
两万塞斯特斯换一万

246
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,734
Twenty-thousand
sesterces for the ten,

247
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:31,171
但你们三个继续做马房

247
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:31,171
but the three of you
stay on as stable hands

248
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,605
最大限度地利用他们

248
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,605
to get the most out of them.

249
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,106
- 我们接受。- 两个提议。

249
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,106
- We accept.
- Both offers.

250
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,675
去他妈的。我们说好要回去的。

250
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,675
The hell we do. We
agreed to go back.

251
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,611
埃利亚看看周围

251
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,611
Elia, look around.

252
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,880
- 你真的想回去吗？- 是的

252
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,880
- Do you really want to go back?
- Yes.

253
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,182
我们在马克西姆斯马戏团这里是天蝎座

253
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,182
We're at Circus Maximus
and this is Scorpus.

254
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,285
他想买下你的马然后雇我们。

254
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,285
He's trying to buy
your horses and hire us.

255
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,855
没错他想把我们困在这个城市的下水道里。

255
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,855
Exactly. He wants to trap
us in this sewer of a city.

256
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,191
两万塞斯特斯。

256
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,191
Twenty thousand sesterces.

257
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,258
我会把钱。

257
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,258
I will take the money.

258
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,894
但我们同意卖了马回去。

258
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,894
But we agreed to sell
the horses and go back.

259
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,895
我们真的可以成为这里的某个人。

259
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,895
We could really be someone here.

260
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,263
为我们自己扬名立万。

260
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,263
Make a name for ourselves.

261
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:00,000
马，你想要多少都行。

261
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:00,000
Horses, as many as you want.

262
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,102
我在贝提卡有所有想要的马。

262
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,102
I have all the horses I
want back in Baetica.

263
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,236
小伙子们

263
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,236
Boys.

264
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,270
天蝎座正在等待。

264
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,270
Scorpus is waiting.

265
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:06,573
是的

265
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:06,573
Yes.

266
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:07,773
我们投票。

266
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:07,773
We vote.

267
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,576
我进来了

267
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,576
I'm in.

268
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,710
是的

268
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,710
Yes.

269
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,878
我不投票。我要走了

269
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,878
I am not voting. I'm leaving.

270
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:14,881
埃利亚

270
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:14,881
Elia!

271
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:21,153
他会想通的

271
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:21,153
He'll come around.

272
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:25,759
我们说好的

272
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:25,759
We have a deal.

273
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,559
小混蛋也留下，好吗？

273
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,559
The little shit
stays as well, yes?

274
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,162
是的

274
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,162
Yes.

275
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:42,041
我刚刚驾驶了我一生中最快的马。

275
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:42,041
I have just driven the
fastest horses in my life.

276
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,076
你确定吗？

276
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,076
Are you sure?

277
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,211
他们乘着飞马的翅膀飞翔。

277
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,211
They fly on the
wings of Pegasus.

278
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,148
所以我就买了。

278
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,148
So I bought them.

279
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,884
好吧，用你的钱。

279
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,884
Well, with your money.

280
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,820
- 所以你加入了？- 我当然加入。

280
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,820
- So you're in?
- Of course I'm in.

281
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,890
我一直都在

281
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,890
I've always been in.

282
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:26,318
你想干什么？

282
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:26,318
What do you want?

283
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,756
天蝎座买马不是很正常吗？

283
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,756
Isn't it normal for
Scorpus to buy horses?

284
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,324
用你的钱，是的。

284
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,324
With your money, yes.

285
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,292
这是他自己的事。

285
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,292
This was on his own.

286
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:36,930
你觉得天蝎座会离开我们去别的阵营吗

286
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:36,930
Do you think Scorpus is
leaving us for another faction?

287
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,064
他在策划什么事。

287
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,064
He's up to something.

288
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,800
领事有一个人在这里要求见你。

288
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,800
Consul. There is a man
here requesting an audience.

289
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,435
Tenax，一个平民。

289
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,435
Tenax, a plebeian.

290
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,903
不当然没有

290
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,903
No, of course not.

291
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,239
把他交给我的一个客户。

291
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,239
Send him to one of my clients.

292
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,640
他很坚持。

292
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,640
He is very insistent.

293
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:51,845
他说他有一些关于蓝派的东西要给你。

293
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:51,845
He says he has something to
offer you regarding the Blue Faction.

294
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,218
蓝派五百股。

294
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,218
Five hundred shares
of the Blue Faction.

295
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,422
你怎么拿到这些的

295
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,422
How did you get these?

296
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,923
赌债

296
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,923
A gambling debt.

297
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,392
你为什么带着他们来找我

297
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,392
Why did you come
to me with them?

298
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,862
因为这些股份会让你再次成为蓝派的领导者。

298
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,862
Because these shares will make you
lead owner of the Blue Faction again.

299
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,897
意思是，你会比其他人付更多的钱。

299
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,897
Meaning, you'll pay more
for them than anyone else.

300
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,000
- 也许吧- 当然。

300
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,000
- Perhaps.
- For certain.

301
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:16,903
你当盟主的时候，蓝派很繁荣。

301
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:16,903
The Blue Faction was prosperous
when you were lead owner.

302
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,406
卡尔托尼亚嫁给老利纽斯已经不是什么秘密了

302
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,406
It's no secret that
Caltonia married old Linius

303
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,075
因为他们的股份加起来

303
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,075
because of their
combined shares.

304
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,345
后来，他死了，她仍然是主要的所有者。

304
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,345
And then, he died, and
she remained lead owner.

305
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:29,281
你想要回那个职位也不是什么秘密了。

305
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:29,281
And it's no secret that
you want that position back.

306
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,987
七十万塞斯特斯。

306
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,987
700,000 sesterces.

307
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,123
- 太荒唐了- 八十万塞斯特斯

307
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,123
- That's absurd.
- 800,000 sesterces.

308
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,994
这是一种侮辱性的讨价还价方式。走开

308
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,994
This is an insulting
way to bargain. Be off.

309
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,197
如你所愿

309
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,197
As you wish.

310
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,102
我猜卡托尼亚会想永久巩固她的地位，

310
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,102
I assume Caltonia will want to
permanently solidify her position as

311
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,105
领导者。

311
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,105
lead owner.

312
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,940
别说了

312
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,940
Stop.

313
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,311
五十万

313
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,311
Five hundred thousand.

314
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,213
九

314
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,213
Nine.

315
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:07,921
好吧

315
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:07,921
Fine.

316
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,030
九十万。

316
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,030
Nine hundred thousand.

317
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,865
但我们告诉全世界是五个。

317
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,865
But we tell the
world it was five.

318
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,067
如你所愿

318
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,067
As you wish.

319
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,136
好好享受你的复仇吧领事

319
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,136
Enjoy your revenge, Consul.

320
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,112
卑鄙的人。

320
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,112
Vile man.

321
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,413
为什么他卖给我们而不是她？

321
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,413
Why did he sell to
us and not to her?

322
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:37,450
因为他正确地衡量了我对Caltonia的仇恨

322
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:37,450
Because he correctly
measured my hatred of Caltonia

323
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,952
我想成为领头羊的愿望

323
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,952
with my desire to be lead owner.

324
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:45,525
当她知道这件事时，她会做什么样的表情。

324
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:45,525
What a face she'll make
when she learns of this.

325
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,766
很美，不是吗？

325
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:52,766
Beautiful, isn't it?

326
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:54,968
超越。

326
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:54,968
Beyond.

327
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,872
如果这些犹太人用他们必须建造的设施发动战争，

327
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,872
If these Judeans waged war with
the same facility they have to build,

328
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,272
我们永远也不会打败他们

328
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,272
we never would
have defeated them.

329
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:05,979
弗拉维乌斯·多米提亚努斯

329
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:05,979
Flavius Domitianus.

330
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,289
谢谢你同意见我

330
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,289
Thank you for
agreeing to see me.

331
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,083
你可以为此感谢天蝎座。

331
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,083
You can thank Scorpus for that.

332
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,519
别告诉我你是来讨债的。

332
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,519
Please tell me you're not
here to ask for what I owe you.

333
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:15,821
号

333
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:15,821
No.

334
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,222
不，我早就意识到

334
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,222
No, I've long since
come to realize

335
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,224
接受皇室的赌注

335
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,224
that taking bets from
the Imperial family

336
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,361
只不过是一种税收形式。

336
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,361
is no more than
a form of taxation.

337
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:22,394
好.

337
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:22,394
Good.

338
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,230
说话

338
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,230
Speak.

339
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:28,535
这次谈话应该在四只眼睛的注视下进行。

339
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:28,535
This conversation should
be held under four eyes.

340
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,170
走了

340
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,170
Go.

341
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,074
听着，我不在乎你欠我什么。

341
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,074
Look, I don't care
about what you owe me.

342
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,009
我不在乎你试图操纵

342
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,009
I don't care that
you tried to rig

343
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,911
昨天的比赛，无论如何。

343
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,911
the race yesterday, at all.

344
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,412
它只告诉我一件事。

344
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,412
It just tells me one thing.

345
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,181
你需要钱。

345
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,181
You need money.

346
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,549
很多钱。

346
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,549
Lots of money.

347
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,853
你在玩一个危险的游戏。

347
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,853
You play a dangerous game here.

348
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,253
你也是

348
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,253
As do you.

349
00:29:49,322 --> 00:29:50,589
粮食供应。

349
00:29:49,322 --> 00:29:50,589
The grain supply.

350
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,460
食物暴动野心

350
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,460
Food riots. Ambition.

351
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,127
他们都很危险

351
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,127
They're all dangerous.

352
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,230
我不知道该不该听你的

352
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,230
I don't know whether
I should listen to you

353
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,866
或者干脆杀了你

353
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,866
or simply have you killed.

354
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,134
你可以两样都做

354
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,134
You could do both.

355
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:05,238
为什么不先听我说？

355
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:05,238
Why not listen to
what I have to say first?

356
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,342
- 很好. - 像你一样，我也是个有野心的人。

356
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,342
- Very well.
- Like you, I'm an ambitious man.

357
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:13,212
我的搭档，伟大的御马师，天蝎座，和我

357
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:13,212
My partner, the great
charioteer, Scorpus, and I

358
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:15,347
希望组建一个新的赛车派系

358
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:15,347
wish to form a
new racing faction.

359
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:17,450
他要脱离蓝军？

359
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:17,450
He would break
away from the Blue?

360
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,318
他们为他做了那么多？

360
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,318
After everything
they've done for him?

361
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:20,353
他很有野心。

361
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:20,353
He's ambitious.

362
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,123
和我一样和你一样

362
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,123
Same as me, same as you.

363
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,527
我很享受这样。继续

363
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,527
I'm enjoying this. Continue.

364
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,996
天蝎座和我有足够的钱建立一个新的派系，

364
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,996
Scorpus and I have the
money to start a new faction,

365
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:35,035
我们最近得到了一些马，非常惊人的马，

365
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:35,035
and we've recently acquired
some horses, astonishing horses,

366
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,002
这将确保胜利。

366
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,002
that will ensure victories.

367
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,314
我们现在只需要得到帝国的许可

367
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,314
All we need now is
Imperial permission

368
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:42,107
在马克西姆斯竞技场和他们比赛

368
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:42,107
from you as Aedile Ludi to
race them at the Circus Maximus.

369
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,210
这对我有什么好处

369
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,210
And how would this benefit me?

370
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,578
一条钱的河流。

370
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,578
A river of money.

371
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,651
一半的所有权是秘密的，它将产生一切。

371
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,651
Half ownership in secret
and all that it will yield.

372
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,287
胜利的钱包，门百分比。

372
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,287
Victory purses, gate percentage.

373
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,423
座位费，种马费，投注收入，

373
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,423
Seat fees, stud fees,
betting proceeds,

374
00:30:57,457 --> 00:30:59,558
以及股票本身的价值。

374
00:30:57,457 --> 00:30:59,558
as well as the value of
the shares themselves.

375
00:30:59,592 --> 00:31:02,295
这些“惊人的马”？

375
00:30:59,592 --> 00:31:02,295
These "astonishing horses"?

376
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:06,298
安达卢西亚人用天蝎座的话来说，

376
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:06,298
Andalusians. With, in
the words of Scorpus,

377
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,434
“飞马的翅膀。"

377
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,434
"The wings of Pegasus."

378
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,938
有天蝎座驾驶，我们永远不会输。

378
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,938
With Scorpus driving
them, we'll never lose.

379
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,339
当然，除非，

379
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,339
Unless, of course,

380
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,508
赔率会让亏损变得更有利可图

380
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,508
the odds make
losing more profitable.

381
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,676
还有一件事

381
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,676
And one other thing.

382
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,347
我想正式成为你的客户，

382
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,347
I'd like to formally
become your client,

383
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,482
为了更好地服务于您的利益。

383
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,482
in order to better
serve your interests.

384
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:24,550
我的委托人

384
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:24,550
My client.

385
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,319
这是一大步。

385
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,319
That is a big step.

386
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,256
责任是双向的。

386
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,256
The responsibility
goes both ways.

387
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,660
上上下下

387
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,660
Up and down.

388
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,131
我会考虑的

388
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,131
I'll consider it.

389
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:40,432
还有你的另一个提议

389
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:40,432
And your other offer as well.

390
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:42,535
走了

390
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:42,535
Leave now.

391
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,480
兄弟们！

391
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,480
Brothers!

392
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,354
我要去小便。

392
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,354
Gotta take a piss.

393
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:04,257
啊！我的天啊！看你是不是要在我完事后走。

393
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:04,257
Ah! See if you gotta
go after I'm done.

394
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:36,256
我的珍珠，不然我就把它切了。

394
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:36,256
My pearls, or I cut it off.

395
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,192
我只剩一个了。我发誓

395
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,192
I only have one left. I swear.

396
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:40,727
剩下的我用来还债了。

396
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:40,727
I used the rest to pay debts.

397
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,332
只剩下这些了。

397
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,332
That's all that's left.

398
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,403
在地上

398
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,403
On the ground.

399
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,737
埃利亚，你要我说多少遍

399
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,737
Elia, how many times
do I have to say it?

400
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:27,539
又不是永远。我们很快就会一起回去。

400
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:27,539
It's not forever. We'll all
go back together soon.

401
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,241
具体是什么时候

401
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,241
When, exactly?

402
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,411
在你做马夫而不是马夫之后？

402
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,411
After you're grooms
instead of stable hands?

403
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,380
在你开始开车之后？

403
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,380
After you start driving?

404
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:37,349
给它一个机会。两周后，再做决定。

404
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:37,349
Give it a chance. One
fortnight, then decide.

405
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:38,785
号

405
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:38,785
No.

406
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,253
你们两个都骗了我。

406
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,253
You've lied to me. Both of you.

407
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:44,624
你从没想过要回家，是吗？

407
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:44,624
You never intended
to go home, did you?

408
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:54,233
好好照顾费罗。夏天的大麦，

408
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:54,233
Take good care of Ferox.
Barley in the summer,

409
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:55,711
别忘了带他去牧场

409
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:55,711
and don't forget to
take him to the pasture.

410
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:59,372
只刷水，不刷油。

410
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:59,372
Water brushes only, never oil.

411
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,307
胡萝卜换牙齿

411
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,307
Carrots for his teeth.

412
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,709
伊利亚来了

412
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,709
Elia. Come.

413
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:04,810
快，来！

413
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:04,810
Quickly, come!

414
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,427
费洛斯

414
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,427
Ferox.

415
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,391
靠近一点

415
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,391
Come closer.

416
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,677
是的，是时候了。

416
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,677
Yes, it is that time.

417
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,884
自凯撒·奥古斯都以来，没有一个皇帝

417
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,884
Since Caesar
Augustus, no emperor

418
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,353
由一个真正的儿子继承

418
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,353
has been succeeded
by a true son.

419
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:23,188
他们都被养子跟踪

419
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:23,188
They've all been
followed by adopted sons

420
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:27,360
或者是篡位者直到现在，直到我。

420
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:27,360
or by usurpers.
Until now, until me.

421
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:30,730
哈你

421
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:30,730
Huh.

422
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:32,865
看看你们两个

422
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:32,865
Look at the two of you.

423
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:36,268
两人都有能力取代我的位置。

423
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:36,268
Both more than capable
of taking my place.

424
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,871
提图斯，那个士兵，和我一样

424
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,871
Titus, the soldier, like myself,

425
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:41,340
一系列的胜利。

425
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:41,340
with a string of victories.

426
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:46,311
图密善，我们有洞察力和敏锐的政治家，

426
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:46,311
And Domitian, our politician
of insight and subtlety,

427
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:49,382
在我们不在的时候很擅长应付元老院

427
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:49,382
so adept at handling
the Senate in our absence

428
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:52,452
还帮我固定了教长椅

428
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:52,452
and helping me
secure the curule chair.

429
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,389
这是一个艰难的选择。

429
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,389
It is a difficult choice.

430
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:03,730
但是没有什么比

430
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:03,730
But nothing, nothing
is more important

431
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,498
更重要的罗马了

431
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,498
than protecting
our beloved Rome.

432
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:07,777
我们的外敌很危险，

432
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:07,777
Our foreign enemies
are dangerous,

433
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,971
我们在罗马的敌人也很危险

433
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,971
and our enemies here in
Rome itself are also dangerous.

434
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:16,543
准备牺牲这座城市来实现他们的野心。

434
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:16,543
Ready to sacrifice this city
on the altar of their ambition.

435
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:18,545
但在这两者中，

435
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:18,545
But of the two,

436
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,581
我们的外敌

436
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,581
our foreign enemies,

437
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:26,619
帕提亚人，高卢人，不列颠人，匈奴人

437
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:26,619
the Parthians, the Gauls,
the Britons, the Huns,

438
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,954
他们才是更大的危险

438
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,954
they are the greater danger.

439
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:32,592
因此，我们认为，

439
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:32,592
Therefore,

440
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,463
士兵必须坐在牧师椅上。

440
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,463
a soldier must sit
on the curule chair.

441
00:36:41,668 --> 00:36:46,572
提图斯你将成为皇帝

441
00:36:41,668 --> 00:36:46,572
Titus, you will be Emperor.

442
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,813
图密善？

442
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,813
Domitian?

443
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:58,451
我会尽我所能为我哥哥服务

443
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:58,451
I will serve my brother
in every way I can.

444
00:36:58,485 --> 00:36:59,853
那很好.

444
00:36:58,485 --> 00:36:59,853
That is good.

445
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,621
门！

445
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,621
Door!

446
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:25,545
你现在罢工吗？

446
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:25,545
Do you strike now?

447
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,047
对抗提图斯的军团？

447
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,047
Against Titus' legions?

448
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,784
他的财富和禁卫军的忠诚

448
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,784
His riches and the loyalty
of the Praetorian Guards?

449
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:34,987
号让提图斯相信他赢了

449
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:34,987
No. Let Titus believe he's won.

450
00:37:35,021 --> 00:37:37,757
我要用我得到的武器和他战斗。

450
00:37:35,021 --> 00:37:37,757
I will fight him with the
weapons I've been granted.

451
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:45,831
不。我一定看起来像

451
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:45,831
No, no, no. I must look like

452
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,934
亚历山大大帝，不是街头妓女。

452
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,934
Alexander the Great,
not a street whore.

453
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:52,005
我需要一些更戏剧性的东西来装饰我的隆重登场。

453
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:52,005
I need something much more
dramatic for my grand entrance.

454
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:53,572
天蝎座大帝

454
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:53,572
Scorpus the Great.

455
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,876
自己派系的司机。- 是吗-是的

455
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,876
Driver of his own faction. Yes?

456
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:57,911
出去！

456
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:57,911
Out!

457
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:03,849
嗯？

457
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:03,849
Hmm?

458
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:06,085
这就是你所谓的谨慎吗

458
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:06,085
Is this what you call discreet?

459
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,054
一旦我们得到图密善的批准消息就会传开。

459
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,054
Word will get out once
we get Domitian's approval.

460
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:11,891
如果我们得到批准。

460
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:11,891
If we get approval.

461
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,793
来吧，他在马厩等我们

461
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,793
Come, he's meeting
us at the stables

462
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:15,829
去看安达卢西亚人

462
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:15,829
to look at the Andalusians.

463
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,876
- 我操！- 加弗罗斯去找医生了

463
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,876
- Fuck!
- Gavros went to go get a physician.

464
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,117
- 大人. - 大人.

464
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,117
- My lord.
- My lord.

465
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,389
为什么没人告诉我？

465
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,389
Why didn't someone tell me?

466
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,925
图密善，他来了。外面

466
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,925
Domitian, he's here. Outside.

467
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,827
就像我说的，操！

467
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,827
As I said, fuck!

468
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:52,532
好吧，我去引开他。

468
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:52,532
All right, I'll divert him.

469
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:54,833
拉上窗帘。去，闭上眼睛。

469
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:54,833
Close the curtains.
Go, close them.

470
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:57,137
来吧

470
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:57,137
Come on.

471
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:00,773
来帮帮我

471
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:00,773
Come, help me.

472
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:04,077
这里.

472
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:04,077
Here.

473
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,447
弗拉维乌斯·多米提亚努斯

473
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,447
Flavius Domitianus.

474
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,057
那些长着飞马翅膀的马在哪里？

474
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,057
Where are these horses
with the wings of Pegasus?

475
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:12,184
首先，来点食物或酒怎么样？

475
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:12,184
First, how about some
food, or wine, perhaps?

476
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,619
号

476
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,619
No.

477
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,021
女孩，或者男孩？

477
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,021
Girls, or maybe boys?

478
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,528
我在想，马厩并没有展示他们最好的一面。

478
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,528
I was thinking, the stables
don't show them at their best.

479
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,896
你应该看看他们在赛道上的表现，

479
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:23,896
You should see
them on the track,

480
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,099
- 跑步，也许明天。- Tenax！

480
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,099
- running, perhaps tomorrow?
- Tenax!

481
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:28,101
我没时间跟你说这个。他们在哪里？

481
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:28,101
I have no time for
this. Where are they?

482
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:33,172
我很了解马，能看到它们奔跑或马厩。

482
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:33,172
I know horses well enough
to see them running or stabled.

483
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:37,077
大人.

483
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:37,077
My lord.

484
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:41,581
弗拉维乌斯·多米提亚努斯，你让我们荣誉。

484
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:41,581
Flavius Domitianus,
you honor us.

485
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:42,782
天蝎座。

485
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:42,782
Scorpus.

486
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:47,820
而且很清醒已经印象深刻了。这是其中之一吗

486
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:47,820
And sober. Impressed
already. Is this one of them?

487
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,989
是的，是的，费罗克斯。率先

487
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,989
Yes, yes, Ferox. The lead.

488
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:57,797
他为什么被吊着？

488
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:57,797
Why is he in a sling?

489
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,166
这是西班牙人的技术殿下

489
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,166
It's a Spanish
technique, Your Highness.

490
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:04,036
在长时间的上坡跑后，我们把它们吊起来放了一天。

490
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:04,036
We sling them for a
day after a long uphill run.

491
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,739
这使他们在平地上更快。

491
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,739
It makes them
faster on the flat.

492
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:09,442
是的我听说过这个技术。

492
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:09,442
Yes. Yes, I've heard
of this technique.

493
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,144
其他人呢？

493
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,144
Where are the others?

494
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,880
在牧场。

494
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,880
At pasture.

495
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,018
外面

495
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,018
Outside.

496
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:21,554
没事的

496
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:21,554
It's okay.

497
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,034
马克西姆斯马戏团现在有五个派系。

497
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,034
Circus Maximus
now has five factions.

498
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:36,001
你们每人将拥有四分之一。

498
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:36,001
Each of you will
own one quarter.

499
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:40,673
我对其中一半的所有权将继续保留。

499
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:40,673
My ownership of one half
shall remain in the shadows.

500
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:42,509
- 如你所愿- 听我的命令。

500
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:42,509
- As you wish.
- As I command.

501
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:47,112
别让我失望

501
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:47,112
Do not disappoint me.

502
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:49,181
殿下

502
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:49,181
Your Highness.

503
00:40:53,853 --> 00:40:55,188
还有一件事

503
00:40:53,853 --> 00:40:55,188
One more thing.

504
00:40:57,891 --> 00:41:00,092
我决定让你成为我的客户之一。

504
00:40:57,891 --> 00:41:00,092
I've decided to make
you one of my clients.

505
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,028
你让我感到荣誉。

505
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,028
You honor me.

506
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:06,166
我将为你的利益服务，直到我死。

506
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:06,166
Till my death, I will
serve your interests.

507
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,235
如果对我合适，我会保护你的。

507
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,235
And should it suit me,
I may protect yours.

508
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,909
跟我

508
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,909
With me.

509
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,250
奥甘德斯，这是最好的。

509
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,250
Augendus, the best there is.

510
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:27,219
他曾经是绿党的兽医。

510
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:27,219
He was once
veterinarius for the Greens.

511
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:30,590
你是对的，加夫罗斯。肯定是茄属植物

511
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:30,590
You were right, Gavros.
Most definitely nightshade.

512
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:32,291
你能为他们做什么？

512
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:32,291
What can you do for them?

513
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,561
埋了他们。

513
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,561
Bury them.

514
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:36,028
我没心情开玩笑。

514
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:36,028
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

515
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,329
你能做的很少。

515
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,329
There's little you can do.

516
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:40,967
一个马格纳斯可能会说，把乌鸦在他们的摊位三个晚上。

516
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:40,967
A magnus might say put crows
in their stalls for three nights.

517
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:44,704
用铃铛把奥奇的灵魂从他们的肝脏里召唤出来。

517
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:44,704
And use bells to call out the
Orci spirits from their livers.

518
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:48,907
我可不想拿我的命去赌。尽你所能

518
00:41:44,737 --> 00:41:48,907
I'm not going to bet my life
on that one. Do what you can.

519
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,947
没有人见过这个。

519
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,947
No one has seen this.

520
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:57,217
如果你告诉任何人，

520
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:57,217
If you tell a single
fucking person,

521
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,085
你会死得很惨你明白吗？

521
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,085
you will die in ways you cannot
imagine. Do you understand?

522
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:02,922
是的

522
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:02,922
Yes.

523
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:05,824
记住你唯一要害怕的人

523
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:05,824
Remember, the only
person you have to fear

524
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,862
比图密善更重要的是我

524
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,862
more than Domitian, is me.

525
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:12,297
我们明白，先生。我们在这里什么也没看到。

525
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:12,297
We understand, sir. We
have seen nothing here.

526
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:17,637
你们两个

526
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:17,637
You two.

527
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,108
安德里亚，埃利亚，来。

527
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,108
Andria, Elia, come.

528
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,717
好吧，弟弟。

528
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,717
All right, little brother.

529
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:34,153
你赢了这太危险了

529
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:34,153
You win. This is
getting too dangerous.

530
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:35,989
我说我们沿着玩到天黑，

530
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:35,989
I say we play along until dark,

531
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,791
然后溜出城

531
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,791
and then slip out of the city.

532
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:40,193
- 去哪里？- 任何地方，除了这里。

532
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:40,193
- To go where?
- Anywhere, other than here.

533
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:43,295
- 回家- 我不会让我们的马去死的

533
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:43,295
- Home.
- I'm not going to leave our horses to die.

534
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:44,963
现在他想留下来。

534
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:44,963
Now he wants to stay.

535
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:48,335
这些马还是小马驹的时候我们就养大了。

535
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:48,335
We have reared these horses
ever since they were foals.

536
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:51,838
我爱他们，我不会丢下他们的。

536
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:51,838
I love them, and I'm not
going to leave them behind.

537
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:54,007
皇帝的儿子看到我们了

537
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:54,007
The Emperor's son has seen us.

538
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,376
如果我们逃跑能逃多远？

538
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,376
How far would we get if we run?

539
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,643
我们别无选择

539
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,643
We have no option.

540
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:01,181
我们加入天蝎座和Tenax。

540
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:01,181
We throw in with
Scorpus and Tenax.

541
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:07,152
去找警卫。我会再送些过去

541
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:07,152
And get guards. I'll send more.

542
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:08,221
这是谁干的？

542
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:08,221
Who did this?

543
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:11,224
我也正想问你呢。

543
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:11,224
I was about to ask
you the same thing.

544
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:12,625
我没告诉任何人。

544
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:12,625
I told no one.

545
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:16,096
除了你那该死的裁缝和谁知道还有谁安东尼娅，也许？

545
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:16,096
Except your bloody tailor and who
knows who else. Antonia, perhaps?

546
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:18,864
图密善有奴隶和随从。他们会说话

546
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:18,864
Domitian has slaves
and attendants. They talk.

547
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:21,266
太晚了

547
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:21,266
It's too late now.

548
00:43:22,402 --> 00:43:23,969
我参加比赛的第一年，

548
00:43:22,402 --> 00:43:23,969
My first year of racing,

549
00:43:24,003 --> 00:43:26,239
红军的领头马中了龙葵毒

549
00:43:24,003 --> 00:43:26,239
the Reds' lead horse was
poisoned with nightshade.

550
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,440
卡尔杜斯医生用黄色的灰烬治愈了它。

550
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,440
Physician Caldus
cured it with yellow ash.

551
00:43:28,474 --> 00:43:31,811
黄色的灰烬是毒药。它会比治愈更快地杀死你。

551
00:43:28,474 --> 00:43:31,811
Yellow ash is poison. It
will kill quicker than cure.

552
00:43:31,844 --> 00:43:33,012
这对Caldus很有效。

552
00:43:31,844 --> 00:43:33,012
It worked for Caldus.

553
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,447
你能抓住他吗？他在哪里？

553
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,447
Can you get him? Where is he?

554
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:37,250
庞贝。我去吧

554
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:37,250
Pompeii. I'll go.

555
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,119
你和他一起去保证他的安全

555
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,119
You go with him. Keep him safe.

556
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:43,722
别让人看见。

556
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:43,722
Try not to be seen.

557
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:46,226
我们去找些新鲜的马。

557
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:46,226
Let's get some fresh horses.

558
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,030
天蝎座！天蝎座

558
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,030
Scorpus! Scorpus!

559
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,367
- 警卫- 是的先生

559
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,367
- Guards.
- Yes, sir.

560
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:04,844
Tenax我已经付过你的人钱了。

560
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:04,844
Tenax. I paid your men already.

561
00:44:04,878 --> 00:44:07,179
- 两周前。- 我不收。

561
00:44:04,878 --> 00:44:07,179
- A fortnight ago.
- I'm not collecting.

562
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:10,282
我请客龙葵

562
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:10,282
I'm buying. Nightshade.

563
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:15,221
我不卖毒药。

563
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:15,221
I don't sell poisons.

564
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:17,456
Anymore.

564
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:17,456
Anymore.

565
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:21,728
我把所有的都卖了。

565
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:21,728
I sold all I had.

566
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:24,764
对谁？

566
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:24,764
To whom?

567
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,873
我知道你给我的马下毒。谁雇你的

567
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,873
I know that you poisoned
my horses. Who hired you?

568
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:08,807
无论如何你都会杀了我。

568
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:08,807
You are going to kill me anyway.

569
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:11,110
我为什么要告诉你？

569
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:11,110
Why should I tell you?

570
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:13,913
别那么肯定我会杀了你。

570
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:13,913
Don't be so sure
I'm going to kill you.

571
00:45:13,947 --> 00:45:15,815
你活着对我更有用。

571
00:45:13,947 --> 00:45:15,815
You might be more
use to me alive.

572
00:45:17,016 --> 00:45:20,052
只有他自己知道。

572
00:45:17,016 --> 00:45:20,052
Salto there, only he knew.

573
00:45:20,987 --> 00:45:23,289
他和垃圾堆里的某个人说话。

573
00:45:20,987 --> 00:45:23,289
He spoke to someone in a litter.

574
00:45:23,322 --> 00:45:26,059
- 当我穿过广场。- 描述一下垃圾。

574
00:45:23,322 --> 00:45:26,059
- When I was across the square.
- Describe the litter.

575
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:30,163
真不错金色和绿色条纹，木柄。

575
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:30,163
Fancy. Gold and green
stripes, with wooden handles.

576
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:33,333
记住我的仁慈

576
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:33,333
Remember my mercy.

577
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:39,072
找出那垃圾是谁的。

577
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:39,072
Find out who owns that litter.

578
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:58,157
- 死了多少人- 这是第一个。

578
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:58,157
- How many have died?
- This is the first.

579
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,226
到目前为止，我救了其他人。

579
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,226
I have saved the
others thus far.

580
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:01,795
加夫罗斯

580
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:01,795
Gavros.

581
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:05,164
去买其他的马。

581
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:05,164
Find other horses to buy.

582
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:07,434
所有的好货都归派系所有。

582
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:07,434
All the good stock is
owned by the factions.

583
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:10,170
你找到的任何东西都不会那么好。

583
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:10,170
Anything you find
will not be as good.

584
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,471
他们会活下来的

584
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,471
They'll be alive.

585
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,179
没有更多.

585
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,179
No more.

586
00:46:20,213 --> 00:46:22,315
我们收拾行李准备离开

586
00:46:20,213 --> 00:46:22,315
We pack and we'll
be ready to leave

587
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,117
安德里亚一回来就去

587
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,117
as soon as Andria returns.

588
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,418
我告诉过你了。我不会走的

588
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,418
I've told you. I'm not leaving.

589
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:31,490
你还是个孩子你一直都是个孩子。

589
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:31,490
You're a child. You've
always been a child.

590
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:38,030
自从我们的母亲生你时去世，安德里亚和我就把你宠坏了.

590
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:38,030
Andria and I have spoiled you since the
moment our mother died giving birth to you.

591
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:44,838
好吧走了

591
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:44,838
Fine. Go.

592
00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:13,532
妈妈，你没事吧？

592
00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:13,532
Mother, are you all right?

593
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:19,304
- 我能帮你吗- 好的麻烦您

593
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:19,304
- Can I help you with that?
- Yes, please.

594
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:39,626
- 我们说什么？- 谢谢

594
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:39,626
- What do we say?
- Thank you.

595
00:48:13,126 --> 00:48:15,394
乌拉乌拉，起来。

595
00:48:13,126 --> 00:48:15,394
Woola. Woola, get up.

596
00:48:18,731 --> 00:48:19,932
就是这个

596
00:48:18,731 --> 00:48:19,932
That's the one.

597
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:23,670
来吧，让我们看看它去哪里。

597
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:23,670
Come on, let's
see where it goes.

598
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:31,945
让开

598
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:31,945
Make way.

599
00:48:34,347 --> 00:48:35,715
让开

599
00:48:34,347 --> 00:48:35,715
Make way.

600
00:48:35,748 --> 00:48:39,351
金色和绿色条纹。这绝对是垃圾。

600
00:48:35,748 --> 00:48:39,351
Gold and green stripes.
This is definitely the litter.

601
00:48:49,228 --> 00:48:50,496
去找Tenax

601
00:48:49,228 --> 00:48:50,496
Go get Tenax.

602
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,503
是的当然为了你，我会冲。

602
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,503
Yes, of course.
For you, I'll rush.

603
00:48:56,536 --> 00:48:58,637
我可以在一个月内准备好。

603
00:48:56,536 --> 00:48:58,637
I can have them ready
in less than a month.

604
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:01,340
我没有一个月的时间，我肯定有两天。

604
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:01,340
I don't have a month,
I'm sure I have two days.

605
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:03,143
这些呢？

605
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:03,143
What about these?

606
00:49:03,175 --> 00:49:07,047
哦这是我最好的作品

606
00:49:03,175 --> 00:49:07,047
Oh. These are my best work.

607
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,617
- 我可以给你做一双一模一样的。- 我要这些。

607
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,617
- I can build a pair exactly like these for you.
- I'll take these.

608
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,119
不，这些是莱托的。他为他们订购了氙气。

608
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,119
No, these are Leto's. He
ordered them for Xenon.

609
00:49:14,153 --> 00:49:16,755
他们现在是我的了重新粉刷。

609
00:49:14,153 --> 00:49:16,755
They're mine now. Repaint them.

610
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:18,157
我不能我

610
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:18,157
I can't.

611
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,458
我们找到垃圾了！

611
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,458
We found the litter!

612
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,427
重新粉刷。

612
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,427
Repaint them.

613
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:23,663
什么颜色？

613
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:23,663
What color?

614
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:30,103
围过来，围过来。

614
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:30,103
Gather round, gather round.

615
00:49:31,204 --> 00:49:33,206
拍卖会就要开始了。

615
00:49:31,204 --> 00:49:33,206
The auction is about to begin.

616
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:34,407
让开！

616
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:34,407
Make way there!

617
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:42,414
好吧

617
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:42,414
All right.

618
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:46,318
作为我们的第一个祭品。

618
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:46,318
For our first offering.

619
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:49,556
看看这个英国人。不仅漂亮，

619
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:49,556
Look at this Briton.
Not only beautiful,

620
00:49:49,588 --> 00:49:51,791
但她做的菜都很好吃

620
00:49:49,588 --> 00:49:51,791
but she cooks all
the wonderful dishes

621
00:49:51,824 --> 00:49:53,726
英国人因此而闻名

621
00:49:51,824 --> 00:49:53,726
for which the Britons
are so famous.

622
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,795
谁给我100塞斯特斯？

622
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,795
Who'll give me 100 sesterces?

623
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,434
噢，来吧。那就80。

623
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,434
Oh come on. Eighty, then.

624
00:50:02,568 --> 00:50:04,804
好极了这个是你的。

624
00:50:02,568 --> 00:50:04,804
Excellent. This one's yours.

625
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:06,606
快过来接她。

625
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:06,606
Step right up and
come and get her.

626
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,677
下一个，是一个工作狂。

626
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,677
Up next, this
workhorse of a girl.

627
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,579
适合任何类型的耕作。

627
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,579
Suitable for either
type of ploughing.

628
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,347
谁给我50块？

628
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,347
Who'll give me 50?

629
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:16,349
我给你50.

629
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:16,349
I'll give you 50.

630
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:19,452
50在这里过来拿钥匙

630
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:19,452
Fifty over here.
Come and get the key.

631
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:23,056
现在，我们的主要吸引力。

631
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:23,056
And now, for our
main attraction.

632
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,657
努米底亚姐妹篇。

632
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,657
A pair of Numidian sisters.

633
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:29,295
作为一套或单独出售。有人出价吗？

633
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:29,295
Sold as a set or
individually. Any bids?

634
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:30,630
一百块

634
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:30,630
One hundred.

635
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:32,798
180

635
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:32,798
One-eighty.

636
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,534
两百块

636
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,534
Two hundred.

637
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:36,635
我听说这个是处女。

637
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:36,635
I'm told this one is a virgin.

638
00:50:37,737 --> 00:50:40,206
没有人或野兽碰过。

638
00:50:37,737 --> 00:50:40,206
Untouched by man or beast.

639
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:41,541
谁给我250？

639
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:41,541
Who'll give me 250?

640
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:45,210
有人出价吗？四百？

640
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:45,210
Now any bids? 400?

641
00:50:45,244 --> 00:50:46,413
五

641
00:50:45,244 --> 00:50:46,413
Five.

642
00:50:46,445 --> 00:50:48,114

642
00:50:46,445 --> 00:50:48,114

Eight.

644
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:51,818
三千塞斯特斯。

644
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:51,818
Three thousand sesterces.

645
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,322
成交三千塞斯特斯。

645
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,322
Sold! For 3,000 sesterces.

646
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:57,556
我的话。

646
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:57,556
My word.

647
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,092
快来拿你的东西。

647
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,092
Come and get your goods.

648
00:51:16,842 --> 00:51:18,644
妈妈！

648
00:51:16,842 --> 00:51:18,644
Mother!

649
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:21,380
有点同情心吧。

649
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:21,380
Have some pity.

650
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:22,614
- 求你了- 不好意思

650
00:51:21,414 --> 00:51:22,614
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

651
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:24,650
妈妈！妈妈！

651
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:24,650
Mother! Mother!

652
00:51:24,684 --> 00:51:27,820
下一个，她的妹妹。

652
00:51:24,684 --> 00:51:27,820
And next, her sister.

653
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:28,922
妈妈！

653
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:28,922
Mother!

654
00:51:28,954 --> 00:51:33,793
也许不是处女，但坚固和良好的形成。

654
00:51:28,954 --> 00:51:33,793
Perhaps not a virgin, but
sturdy and well formed.

655
00:51:36,496 --> 00:51:37,664
五百

655
00:51:36,496 --> 00:51:37,664
Five hundred.

656
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:40,166
我出八百。

656
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:40,166
I bid 800.

657
00:51:42,735 --> 00:51:44,804
500块卖给Tenax

657
00:51:42,735 --> 00:51:44,804
Sold to Tenax for 500.

658
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,744
不，不我出800.

658
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,744
No, no, no. I bid 800.

659
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:53,278
抱歉，我没听见。

659
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:53,278
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

660
00:51:53,313 --> 00:51:56,382
给你，给你，1000.

660
00:51:53,313 --> 00:51:56,382
Here, here, 1,000.

661
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,684
她已经被卖了。

661
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,684
She's already sold.

662
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,586
号号

662
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,586
No. No.

663
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:04,190
1000，我加倍你的出价。

663
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:04,190
One thousand, I double your bid.

664
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:05,858
抱歉，交易已经完成了。

664
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:05,858
Sorry, the deal is done.

665
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,411
塔莉亚你先出去

665
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,411
Talia, leave us.

666
00:52:29,382 --> 00:52:30,382
坐下

666
00:52:29,382 --> 00:52:30,382
Sit.

667
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:35,822
我说了坐下。

667
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:35,822
I said sit.

668
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:38,425
你带我走之后，

668
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:38,425
After you take me,

669
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:41,795
你迟早会睡着的。

669
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:41,795
sooner or later
you will fall asleep.

670
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:43,929
如果你这么做了，我会割断你的喉咙。

670
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:43,929
And when you do,
I will slit your throat.

671
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:45,498
你要割断我的喉咙？

671
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:45,498
You're going to slit my throat?

672
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:52,237
我拥有你。你是我的奴隶

672
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:52,237
I own you. You are my slave.

673
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:55,208
我可以对你为所欲为。

673
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:55,208
I can do whatever
I want with you.

674
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,396
你不会放弃的。

674
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,396
You don't give up.

675
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:17,463
我是她妈妈。

675
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:17,463
I am her mother.

676
00:53:22,902 --> 00:53:24,371
我女朋友

676
00:53:22,902 --> 00:53:24,371
My girl.

677
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,873
奥拉，我在这里。

677
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,873
Aura, I'm here.

678
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:31,978
我已经告诉你了她是销售

678
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:31,978
I already told you.
She's not for sale.

679
00:53:32,012 --> 00:53:35,481
一切都是销售在合适的价格。

679
00:53:32,012 --> 00:53:35,481
Everything is for
sale at the right price.

680
00:53:35,514 --> 00:53:36,516
不是她

680
00:53:35,514 --> 00:53:36,516
Not her.

681
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:38,918
你为什么买她？

681
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:38,918
Why did you buy her?

682
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:42,322
我想知道买下你另一个女儿的人的事。

682
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:42,322
I need to know things about the
person who bought your other daughter.

683
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:45,759
我明白了.

683
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:45,759
I see.

684
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,059
你想利用这个女儿

684
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,059
You seek to use this daughter

685
00:53:47,092 --> 00:53:50,864
作为我另一个女儿的中间人来监视你的敌人

685
00:53:47,092 --> 00:53:50,864
as a go-between to my other
daughter to spy on your enemy.

686
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:54,800
我有别的选择。

686
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:54,800
I have an alternative.

687
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:56,603
我听着呢

687
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:56,603
I'm listening.

688
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:58,304
我会做你的中间人

688
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:58,304
I will be your go-between.

689
00:53:59,572 --> 00:54:01,840
但你不能碰她。

689
00:53:59,572 --> 00:54:01,840
But you don't touch her.

690
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:04,510
等这一切结束了不管是什么

690
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:04,510
And when this is
over, whatever it is,

691
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,478
你允许我买下她

691
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,478
you allow me to buy her.

692
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:08,782
以你为代价。

692
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:08,782
At your cost.

693
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:16,989
号

693
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:16,989
No.

694
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:20,592
当这一切都完成后，

694
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:20,592
When all this is done,

695
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:23,896
我会考虑以任何我喜欢的价格把她卖给你。

695
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:23,896
I will consider selling her to
you for whatever price I like.

696
00:54:29,135 --> 00:54:30,469
我需要住宿。

696
00:54:29,135 --> 00:54:30,469
I need lodging.

697
00:54:39,478 --> 00:54:40,646
我在后面有个房间。

697
00:54:39,478 --> 00:54:40,646
I have a room at the back.

698
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:43,016
你可以和你女儿住几晚。

698
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:43,016
You can stay with your
daughter for a couple of nights.

699
00:54:49,088 --> 00:54:50,523
我叫卡拉。

699
00:54:49,088 --> 00:54:50,523
My name is Cala.

700
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,362
你没事吧？

700
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,362
Are you all right?

701
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:23,155
嘿嘘

701
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:23,155
Hey, shh!

702
00:55:23,188 --> 00:55:25,557
水，不是毒药。

702
00:55:23,188 --> 00:55:25,557
Water, not poison.

703
00:55:31,463 --> 00:55:32,699
你对我做得很好。

703
00:55:31,463 --> 00:55:32,699
You did well against me.

704
00:55:32,731 --> 00:55:35,135
- 你想干什么？- 好的

704
00:55:32,731 --> 00:55:35,135
- What do you want?
- A deal.

705
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:43,376
你看到那个大块头角斗士在看我们吗？

705
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:43,376
Did you see the big
gladiator watching us?

706
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:47,079
脖子上有标记的巨人

706
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:47,079
The giant one with the
markings on his neck.

707
00:55:47,112 --> 00:55:49,715
- 是的- 他是Flamma。

707
00:55:47,112 --> 00:55:49,715
- Yes.
- He is Flamma.

708
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:51,384
他会杀了我的

708
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:51,384
He's going to kill me.

709
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:53,719
可怜你。

709
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:53,719
Pity you.

710
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:55,954
是的可怜可怜我吧。

710
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:55,954
Yes. Pity me.

711
00:55:57,222 --> 00:55:58,958
从我小时候起，

711
00:55:57,222 --> 00:55:58,958
See, from the
time I was a child,

712
00:55:58,992 --> 00:56:02,128
我一直都是最大最强壮最快的

712
00:55:58,992 --> 00:56:02,128
I've always been the
biggest, strongest, the fastest.

713
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:05,130
作为一个战士，我总是杀得很轻松。

713
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:05,130
As a warrior, I have
always killed with ease.

714
00:56:05,164 --> 00:56:08,034
也许你会让这位弗拉玛大吃一惊

714
00:56:05,164 --> 00:56:08,034
Perhaps you'll
surprise this Flamma.

715
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:09,068
号

715
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:09,068
No.

716
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:13,005
他要杀我易如反掌。

716
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:13,005
He's going to kill me with ease.

717
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,009
他比我高大，比我敏捷，比我强壮，

717
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,009
He's bigger than me, faster
than me, stronger than me,

718
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:18,610
他有无穷的技巧

718
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:18,610
and he has an
endless well of tricks,

719
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:21,648
任何一个都能让我的肚子被剑刺穿

719
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:21,648
any of which can put a
sword through my belly.

720
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:23,583
这跟我有什么关系

720
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:23,583
What is this to me?

721
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,585
那个商人法里德

721
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,585
The trader, Farid.

722
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:29,989
他说你徒手杀死了一头狮子。

722
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:29,989
He said that you killed
a lion without a weapon.

723
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,726
这是我对罗马人撒的谎

723
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,726
That is a lie I tell the Romans

724
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:34,594
被雇来打猎

724
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:34,594
to get hired for their hunts.

725
00:56:37,496 --> 00:56:39,965
我曾经在没有武器的情况下杀死过一只豹子。

725
00:56:37,496 --> 00:56:39,965
I did once kill a leopard
without a weapon.

726
00:56:40,967 --> 00:56:42,168
它几乎完全长大了，

726
00:56:40,967 --> 00:56:42,168
It was almost full-grown,

727
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:45,137
有时豹子也能杀死狮子

727
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:45,137
and sometimes a
leopard can kill a lion.

728
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:48,742
这就像我杀死了一头狮子。

728
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:48,742
So that is almost
like me killing a lion.

729
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:54,014
差不多了

729
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:54,014
Almost.

730
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:01,653
也许在这里面有一些小东西

730
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:01,653
Perhaps in that, there
is some little thing

731
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:03,789
我可以用来对付火焰。

731
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:03,789
I can use against Flamma.

732
00:57:03,822 --> 00:57:07,559
你所知道的，什么都不是，

732
00:57:03,822 --> 00:57:07,559
With what you know,
which is nothing,

733
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:10,797
你在竞技场一天都活不下去

733
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:10,797
you will not survive
one day in the arena.

734
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:14,034
但如果你告诉我你所知道的

734
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:14,034
But if you tell me what you know

735
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:18,070
和比你更大更强壮的动物战斗

735
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:18,070
about fighting animals
bigger and stronger than you,

736
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:21,173
我可以教你我们的武器

736
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:21,173
I can teach you our weapons.

737
00:57:21,206 --> 00:57:23,208
给你一个生存的机会，

737
00:57:21,206 --> 00:57:23,208
Give you a chance to survive,

738
00:57:23,242 --> 00:57:25,512
梦见木剑

738
00:57:23,242 --> 00:57:25,512
and dream of the wooden sword.

739
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,782
木剑？

739
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,782
The wooden sword?

740
00:57:30,817 --> 00:57:32,217
自由

740
00:57:30,817 --> 00:57:32,217
Freedom.

741
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:35,155
如果角斗士能很好地取悦观众，

741
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:35,155
If a gladiator entertains
the crowd well enough,

742
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:39,092
群众可以要求把木剑给他。

742
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:39,092
the crowd can demand he
be given the wooden sword.

743
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:41,126
把他带出这个地方。

743
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:41,126
Which takes him
out of this place.

744
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:45,764
- 有价值的人。- 你的呢？

744
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:45,764
- The worthy ones.
- And what is yours?

745
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:51,838
去解救我的姐妹篇们，去杀罗马人。

745
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:51,838
To free my sisters,
and kill Romans.

746
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,606
可惜我们杀不了他们。

746
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,606
Pity we can't kill them all.

747
00:57:55,307 --> 00:57:57,143
那个监视我们的人呢

747
00:57:55,307 --> 00:57:57,143
What of the one
who was watching us?

748
00:57:58,277 --> 00:57:59,746
眼睛像土狼的那个？

748
00:57:58,277 --> 00:57:59,746
The one with the
eyes of a hyena?

749
00:58:00,112 --> 00:58:01,614
毫米图密善

749
00:58:00,112 --> 00:58:01,614
Mm. Domitian.

750
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:06,018
他是皇帝维斯帕先的儿子。

750
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:06,018
He is the son of the
Emperor Vespasian.

751
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:10,023
那他就行

751
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:10,023
Then he will do.

752
00:58:11,757 --> 00:58:12,791
- 你说什么？

752
00:58:11,757 --> 00:58:12,791
What?

753
00:58:14,226 --> 00:58:17,297
你想先杀图密善？

753
00:58:14,226 --> 00:58:17,297
You want to start
with killing Domitian?

754
00:58:19,032 --> 00:58:20,632
那我们就这么做

754
00:58:19,032 --> 00:58:20,632
Then that's what we will do.
