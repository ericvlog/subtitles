1
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:07,940
之前在那些即将死去的人身上......

1
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:07,940
Previously on
Those About To Die...

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,775
图密善的那个人是谁？

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,775
Who was that man with Domitian?

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,778
- 他的名字叫特纳克斯。- 我需要更多地了解他。

3
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,778
- His name is Tenax.
- I need to know more about him.

4
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:15,147
那些股份被你丈夫偷走了。

4
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:15,147
Those shares were
stolen by your husband.

5
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:16,850
奉提图斯皇帝之命，

5
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:16,850
By order of Emperor Titus,

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,917
允许在马克西姆斯竞技场运行

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,917
permission to run
in Circus Maximus

7
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:21,353
特此退出黄金派系。

7
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:21,353
is hereby withdrawn
from the Gold Faction.

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,289
你能赤手空拳杀死什么？

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,289
What could you kill
with your bare hands?

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,091
抑制！

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,091
Restrain!

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,626
我会好好展示他的死。

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,626
I'll make a good
show of his death.

11
00:00:27,626 --> 00:00:29,629
我要从你那里拿走一切。

11
00:00:27,626 --> 00:00:29,629
I'm gonna take
everything from you.

12
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:30,929
乌尔苏斯？

12
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:30,929
Ursus?

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,332
你留下来烧死的那个男孩。

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,332
The boy you left to burn.

14
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,621
乌尔苏斯，乌尔苏斯。

14
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,621
Ursus, Ursus.

15
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,557
你做了什么？

15
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,557
What have you done?

16
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,158
你们这些小混蛋！

16
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:32,158
You little fuckers!

17
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,770
请！加油！帮助！

17
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,770
Please! Come on! Help!

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,139
今天不要这样做！

18
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,139
Don't do this today!

19
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:01,421
乌尔苏斯。

19
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:01,421
Ursus.

20
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,158
乌尔苏斯！

20
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,158
Ursus!

21
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,461
我会敞开心扉。

21
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,461
I'll open up.

22
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,731
我们需要更多的石板。

22
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,731
We need more slates.

23
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,305
还有另一位店员处理挥杆赌注。

23
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,305
And another clerk to
handle the swing bets.

24
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,776
- 你听到了吗？-是的。

24
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,776
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

25
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,376
这被留在了门口。

25
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,376
This was left at the door.

26
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:30,977
读给我听。

26
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:30,977
Read it to me.

27
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,778
- 这可能是个人的，我...-只。。。

27
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,778
- It might be personal, I...
- Just...

28
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,383
做吧。

28
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,383
Do it.

29
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,520
不要感到羞耻。

29
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,520
Don't be ashamed.

30
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,356
我的人民已经有1000年没有书面语言了。

30
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,356
My people had no written
language for 1,000 years.

31
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,293
- 我们的过去是沉默的。- 我不感到羞耻。

31
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,293
- Our past is silent.
- I'm not ashamed.

32
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,462
只是阅读它。

32
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,462
Just read it.

33
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,739
大声地。

33
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,739
Out loud.

34
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:04,610
对我来说。

34
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:04,610
To me.

35
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,248
“您在每个比赛日结束时的所有奖金，

35
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,248
"All of your winnings at
the end of each race day,

36
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:11,016
放在二楼的角落房间，

36
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:11,016
put in the corner
room, second floor,

37
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,353
在Cispian Hill的岛内。

37
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,353
in your insula at Cispian Hill.

38
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,421
这是我沉默的代价。

38
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,421
It's the price of my silence."

39
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:23,495
没有人知道这一点。

39
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:23,495
No one learns of this.

40
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:17,410
赌小金马的人。

40
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:17,410
The one who bet
the little gold horse.

41
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,612
大个子，脸上有烧伤疤痕。

41
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,612
Big, with the burn
scars on his face.

42
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,481
-找到他。- 我们一直在关注......

42
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,481
- Find him.
- We've been keeping our eyes...

43
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:27,319
我说现在就去找他！看看每一个博彩酒馆，

43
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:27,319
I said find him, now! Look
in every betting tavern,

44
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,790
每个妓院，每个排水沟，每个粪坑。

44
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,790
every brothel, every
gutter, every shithole.

45
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,358
找到他！

45
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,358
Find him!

46
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,793
你在外面等我。

46
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,793
You wait for me out there.

47
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,766
吃。

47
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,766
Eat.

48
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:44,504
嘿，你是这批人中最好的。

48
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:44,504
Hey, you're the
best out of this lot.

49
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,805
我有事要你做。

49
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,805
I've got something
for you to do.

50
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,843
Cispian Hill有一间公寓，二楼，角落房间。

50
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,843
There's an apartment on Cispian
Hill, second floor, corner room.

51
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:51,944
我知道。

51
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:51,944
I know it.

52
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,581
去那里。环顾四周。看看你能看到什么，

52
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,581
Go there. Take a look
around. See what you can see,

53
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,584
谁在看。隐身。

53
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,584
who's watching. Be invisible.

54
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,586
嘿，先吃饭。

54
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,586
Hey, eat first.

55
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,791
首先是 Suburra。

55
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,791
The Suburra first.

56
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,927
我有一些想法，他可能藏在哪里。

56
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,927
I've got some ideas
where he might be hiding.

57
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,735
姐姐，这个是我给你拿的。

57
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,735
Sister, I got this for you.

58
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,538
谢谢。

58
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,538
Thank you.

59
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,478
特纳克斯，我找到了他。

59
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,478
Tenax, I found him.

60
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,980
那个伤痕累累的大个子。这边。

60
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,980
The big, scarred man. This way.

61
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,963
拜托，拜托。别杀我。

61
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,963
Please, please. Don't kill me.

62
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,199
别杀我！

62
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,199
Don't kill me!

63
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,600
继续寻找。

63
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,600
Keep looking.

64
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,755
氙！氙！氙！氙！

64
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,755
Xenon! Xenon! Xenon! Xenon!

65
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,996
加油！

65
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,996
Come on!

66
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:35,008
氙！氙！氙！氙！

66
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:35,008
Xenon! Xenon! Xenon! Xenon!

67
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,107
不是天蝎座。

67
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,107
Not Scorpus.

68
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,224
加油！

68
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,224
Come on!

69
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,826
去！

69
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,826
Go!

70
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,368
是的。

70
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,368
Yes.

71
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,779
哎呀！

71
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,779
Hyah!

72
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,716
哎呀！

72
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,716
Hyah!

73
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,187
是的！

73
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,187
Yeah!

74
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,793
是的！

74
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,793
Yeah!

75
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,929
氙！氙！

75
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,929
Xenon! Xenon!

76
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,534
看来 Xenon 正在赚取他的薪水。

76
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,534
It seems Xenon is
earning his salary.

77
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,269
他肯定是。

77
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,269
He most certainly is.

78
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,639
谢谢。谢谢大家。

78
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,639
Thank you. Thank you, all.

79
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,076
这是一场既崇高又当之无愧的胜利。

79
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,076
A victory both
noble and deserved.

80
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,177
谢谢。

80
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,177
Thank you.

81
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,479
谢谢。

81
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,479
Thank you.

82
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,822
祝贺。

82
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,822
Congratulations.

83
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,323
闭上你的嘴。

83
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,323
Shut your mouth.

84
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,326
哦，来吧，第三名。

84
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,326
Oh, come on, third place.

85
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:03,830
这比人们对那些老唠叨的期望要好得多。

85
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:03,830
That's much better than one
would expect with those old nags.

86
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,865
我真的不能说我想念他们。

86
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,865
I can't really say I miss them.

87
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,039
今天对你来说不太顺利。

87
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,039
Didn't go so well for you today.

88
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,711
滚开。

88
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,711
Piss off.

89
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,980
你为什么生我的气？

89
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,980
Why are you angry with me?

90
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,783
我不生气你签了白衣军团。

90
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,783
I'm not angry that you
signed for the White.

91
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,086
我受伤了。伤害你不信任我。

91
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,086
I'm hurt. Hurt you
didn't trust me.

92
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:32,926
发生了一些事情。你需要来。

92
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:32,926
Something has happened.
You need to come.

93
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,134
尼卡。

93
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,134
Nica.

94
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,403
来吧，来吧。

94
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,403
Come, come.

95
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,005
尼卡。

95
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,005
Nica.

96
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,274
对不起。

96
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,274
I'm sorry.

97
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,216
天蝎座排在第三位。

97
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,216
Scorpus comes in third.

98
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,926
天蝎座他妈的第三！

98
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,926
Scorpus fucking third!

99
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,399
他妈的第三。

99
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,399
Fucking third.

100
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,437
他妈的。

100
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,437
Fuck.

101
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,041
安全睡眠。

101
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,041
Sleep safe.

102
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,975
睁一只眼。

102
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,975
One eye open.

103
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,915
我从来不认识我的母亲。

103
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,915
I never knew my mother.

104
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:39,183
费利克斯

104
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:39,183
Felix,

105
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,388
在她生病之前，他记得她。

105
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,388
he remembered her
before she got sick.

106
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,923
他说她真的很漂亮。

106
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,923
He said she was really pretty.

107
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,025
像你一样。

107
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,025
Like you.

108
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,928
令堂。。。

108
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,928
Your mother...

109
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,100
她在云端，

109
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,100
she's up there in the clouds,

110
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,269
看着你。

110
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,269
watching you.

111
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,042
我把他送到了那里。

111
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,042
I sent him there.

112
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,510
我早该知道的。

112
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,510
I should have known.

113
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,264
你确定吗？

113
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,264
Are you sure about this?

114
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,467
他杀了一个孩子。

114
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,467
He killed a child.

115
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,173
快点。

115
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,173
Hurry up.

116
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,509
哦。嘿。

116
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,509
Oh. Hey.

117
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,255
仅此而已。

117
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,255
That's all of it.

118
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,393
听我说。

118
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,393
Listen to me.

119
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:58,163
你们俩一直注视着这个地方。

119
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:58,163
The two of you watch
this place at all times.

120
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,667
比菲利克斯躲得更好。

120
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,667
Hide better than Felix did.

121
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,402
你看到了发生在他身上的事情。

121
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,402
You saw what happened to him.

122
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,807
如果那个伤痕累累的大个子来了，你们中的一个人跟着他

122
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,807
If the big scarred man
comes, one of you follows him

123
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,143
另一个来找我。

123
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,143
and the other one
comes to find me.

124
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,280
要非常小心。

124
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,280
Be very careful.

125
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,436
一个祈祷的Tenax。

125
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,436
A praying Tenax.

126
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,072
我是一个赌徒。

126
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,072
I'm a gambling man.

127
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,539
我会尝试一次。

127
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,539
I'll try anything once.

128
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,610
你为什么起床？

128
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,610
Why are you up?

129
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,312
我睡不着。

129
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,312
I couldn't sleep.

130
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,606
菲利克斯是20年前的我。

130
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,606
Felix was me 20 years ago.

131
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,245
我住在马厩附近的腹地。

131
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,245
I lived in the underbelly,
near the stables.

132
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,349
流浪狗？

132
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,349
A stray?

133
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,619
我一直很喜欢马。所以当我到达罗马时，

133
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,619
I always liked horses.
So when I got to Rome,

134
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,520
感觉像是要去的地方。

134
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,520
it felt like the place to go.

135
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,256
靠近马厩。

135
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,256
Near the stables.

136
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:36,096
我们睡在一大堆里，我们30或40个人

136
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:36,096
We slept in a big
pile, 30 or 40 of us

137
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,630
为了温暖和安全。

137
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,630
for warmth and for safety.

138
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,370
好像有这样的事情。

138
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,370
As if there was such a thing.

139
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,673
但你爬了出来。

139
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,673
But you crawled
your way out of it.

140
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,913
我拾荒了

140
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,913
I scavenged

141
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,283
一次吃一点食物。

141
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,283
one bit of food at a time.

142
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,952
一个丑陋的差事，

142
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,952
One ugly errand,

143
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,221
挨了一打，挨了一打，

143
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,221
one beating taken,
one beating given,

144
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,357
一把刀到肋骨，一个固定的比赛，

144
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,357
one knife to the
ribs, one fixed race,

145
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:10,462
买了一套公寓，一步一个脚印。

145
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:10,462
one apartment bought,
one step at a time.

146
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,138
要么崛起，要么死亡，

146
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,138
Rise or die,

147
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,541
罗马方式。

147
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,541
the Roman way.

148
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,682
在罗马之前，

148
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,682
And before Rome,

149
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,952
他知道什么？

149
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,952
what does he know?

150
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,622
这个要钱的人。

150
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,622
This one who demands the money.

151
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,499
我敢打赌，要解决这个问题。

151
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,499
Something to deal
with this, I wager.

152
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,703
嗯，痊愈了。

152
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,703
Hmm, healed well.

153
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,239
如果有这样的事情。

153
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,239
If there is such a thing.

154
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,416
睡。

154
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,416
Sleep.

155
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,743
- 我们在赛车吗，氙气？- 今天没有比赛。

155
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,743
- Are we racing, Xenon?
- There is no race today.

156
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,317
你从来没有玩得开心过？

156
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,317
You never have any fun?

157
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,419
最后像你一样？

157
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,419
And end up like you?

158
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,556
这对我来说似乎并不好玩。

158
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,556
It doesn't seem like fun to me.

159
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,861
嗯，是的。

159
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,861
Well, it is.

160
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,471
对于一个小男孩来说，这是一个大行李箱。

160
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,471
That's a big trunk
for a small boy.

161
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,406
我们跑去加入军团，是吗？

161
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,406
Running off to join
the legions, are we?

162
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,808
妈妈说我们要搬进大房子。

162
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,808
Mother says we're
moving into a big house.

163
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,377
我要有自己的房间。

163
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,377
I'm going to have my own room.

164
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,747
那么请允许我帮助你，阁下。

164
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,747
Then allow me to help you
with that, Your Eminence.

165
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,321
骑上马鞍。

165
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,321
Saddle up.

166
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,338
丰索亚，我看到我儿子让你去工作了。

166
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,338
Fonsoa, I see my son
has put you to work.

167
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,140
大个子，我需要你的帮助。

167
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,140
Big man, I need your help.

168
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,607
哦，是的。

168
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,607
Oh, yes.

169
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,011
那么，去哪里呢？

169
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,011
So, where to?

170
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,279
埃斯奎林。

170
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,279
The Esquiline.

171
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,415
这是一栋带蓄水池和花园的大房子。

171
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,415
It's a big house with a
cistern and a garden.

172
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,551
这只是我母亲的一个朋友的家。

172
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,551
It's just the home of
a friend of my mother.

173
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,686
只要知道你是你所属的地方。

173
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,686
Just knowing that you
are where you belong.

174
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,789
你找到你的归属了吗？

174
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,789
And have you found
where you belong?

175
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,693
你美丽的贝蒂卡不是在呼唤你吗？

175
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,693
Isn't your beautiful
Baetica calling to you?

176
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,430
确实如此。

176
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,430
It was.

177
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,969
好吧，我感谢你让这个地方对他来说是可以忍受的。

177
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,969
Well, I thank you for making
this place bearable for him.

178
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,071
我和我的弟弟一起练习。

178
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,071
I had practice with
my little brother.

179
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,707
我的母亲死于分娩，

179
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,707
My mother died giving birth,

180
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,942
我们的哥哥总是和马一起离开。

180
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,942
and our older brother was
always off with the horses.

181
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:11,877
所以它落在我身上。

181
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:11,877
So it fell to me.

182
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,449
即使在天堂里，也有艰难的时期。

182
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,449
There were tough
times, even in paradise.

183
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,487
方索阿，

183
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,487
Fonsoa,

184
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,522
你忘了我吗？

184
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,522
did you forget about me?

185
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,395
我们现在应该走了。

185
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,395
We should be going now.

186
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:30,573
- 让我来帮忙。- 不，拜托。

186
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:30,573
- Let me help.
- No, please.

187
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,798
你已经做得够多了。

187
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,798
You've done enough already.

188
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,432
请。

188
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,432
Please.

189
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,806
- 跳上去。-哦。

189
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,806
- Jump on.
- Oh.

190
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:43,942
-准备？-是的。

190
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:43,942
- Ready?
- Yes.

191
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,028
你要告诉我你在想什么吗？

191
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,028
Are you going to tell
me what's on your mind?

192
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,998
你告诉所有人，我会回家的。

192
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,998
You are telling everybody
that I will be returning home.

193
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,598
是的。

193
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,598
Yes.

194
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,336
一旦我们赚到了足够的钱，你就要去Leptis Magna了。

194
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,336
Once we've earned enough for
your passage to Leptis Magna.

195
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,137
如果我等一下不是更好吗？

195
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,137
Wouldn't it be
better if I waited?

196
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,140
我们可以作为一个家庭回来。

196
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,140
We could return as a family.

197
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,776
不，只有上帝才能说

197
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,776
No, only the God can say

198
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,996
需要多长时间才能解救你的兄弟姐妹。

198
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,996
how long it will take to
free your brother and sister.

199
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,115
我需要你在我不在的时候管理交易站。

199
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,115
And I need you to run the
trading post in my absence.

200
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,017
Seeno可以做到这一点。

200
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,017
Seeno can do that.

201
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,196
哦，你宁愿留在这里，

201
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,196
Oh, you'd rather stay here,

202
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,186
在这个蛇窝里。

202
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,186
in this den of serpents.

203
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,489
罗马是一个太危险的地方。

203
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,489
Rome is far too
dangerous a place.

204
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
嗯嗯。

204
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
Mm-mm.

205
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,462
我很惊讶我什至不得不告诉你这个，

205
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,462
I'm surprised I even
have to tell you this,

206
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,597
鉴于我们的经验。

206
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,597
given our experience.

207
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,900
我在这件事上没有发言权吗？

207
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,900
Do I have no say in this matter?

208
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,203
母亲，我们一路走来

208
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,203
Mother, we have
come all this way

209
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,538
到世界的中心。

209
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,538
to the center of the world.

210
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,640
我只是想亲眼看看其中的一些。

210
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,640
I just wish to see
some of it for myself.

211
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,576
你的兄弟姐妹正在为他们的生命而战，

211
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,576
Your brother and sister
are fighting for their lives,

212
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,779
你说得好像这是一次伟大的冒险。

212
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,779
and you talk as if this
is some great adventure.

213
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,615
我必须来这里救你

213
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,615
I had to come here
to save you from

214
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,250
最后在摊位上成为一个妓女。

214
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,250
ending up a whore in a stall.

215
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,452
夸梅很可能会死在竞技场上

215
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,452
Kwame may very
well die in the arena

216
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,055
因为你的愚蠢。

216
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,055
because of your foolishness.

217
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,496
对不起。

217
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,496
I'm sorry.

218
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:11,163
对不起。

218
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:11,163
I'm sorry.

219
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,766
对不起。

219
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,766
I'm sorry.

220
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,868
我无意残忍。

220
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,868
It is not my
intention to be cruel.

221
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:20,039
我的大女儿对这个家庭负有责任。

221
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:20,039
My oldest daughter has a
responsibility to this family.

222
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,509
我不会自私。

222
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,509
I won't suffer selfishness.

223
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:28,647
母亲，你不是唯一一个受苦的人。

223
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:28,647
You are not the only one
who is suffering, Mother.

224
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,849
光环。

224
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,849
Aura.

225
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,699
我本可以派奴隶来换取你的财物。

225
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,699
I could have sent slaves
for your belongings.

226
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,801
这没什么大不了的。

226
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,801
It was no trouble.

227
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:50,236
谢谢。

227
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:50,236
Thank you.

228
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,805
我的人民将从这里拿走它。

228
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,805
My people will
take it from here.

229
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,210
祝你好运。给你们俩。

229
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,210
Good luck to you. To you both.

230
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,578
谢谢。也给你。

230
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,578
Thank you. To you as well.

231
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:22,701
你迟到了。

231
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:22,701
You're late.

232
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,672
听着，一个新郎，瘦小的那个，

232
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,672
Listen, one of the
grooms, the skinny one,

233
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,807
说红色派系正在寻求雇用一名后备司机。

233
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,807
said the Red Faction is
looking to hire a reserve driver.

234
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,777
我们为黄金派系工作，兄弟。

234
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,777
We work for the
Gold Faction, brother.

235
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,747
- 什么黄金派系？- Tenax 说他会修复它。

235
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,747
- What Gold Faction?
- Tenax said he'll fix it.

236
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,182
如果他不这样做呢？

236
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,182
And what if he doesn't?

237
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,189
好的，我们会按照你的计划去做。

237
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,189
All right, we'll you
go with your plan.

238
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,758
我们被红色派系雇用，

238
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,758
We get hired by the Red Faction,

239
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:47,993
让特纳克斯保留我们的马匹，并因侮辱而杀了我们。

239
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:47,993
have Tenax keep our
horses and kill us for the insult.

240
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,094
好主意。

240
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,094
Great idea.

241
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:53,967
Xenon 在这方面很擅长。

241
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:53,967
Xenon is great at this.

242
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,877
是的，他是。

242
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,877
Yeah, he is.

243
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,491
奇怪的是，人群没有要求拿到木剑。

243
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,491
It's strange that the crowd has not
demanded to get the wooden sword.

244
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:22,528
他们做到了，三次。

244
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:22,528
They did, three times.

245
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,463
每当他们给予他自由时，

245
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,463
Each time they
granted him his freedom,

246
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,766
他告诉他们把它推到他们的屁股上。

246
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,766
he told them to
shove it up their arses.

247
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,903
什么样的男人会选择留在赛场上？

247
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,903
What type of man chooses
to stay in the arena?

248
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,640
一个不担心失败的人。

248
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,640
One who's not
worried about losing.

249
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:49,655
角斗士

249
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:49,655
Gladiators,

250
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,790
走近一点。

250
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,790
come closer.

251
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,763
为了庆祝我们的皇帝提图斯的婚礼，

251
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,763
To celebrate the wedding
of our emperor, Titus,

252
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,233
已经召集了特殊的游戏。

252
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,233
special games have been called.

253
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,403
婚礼什么时候举行？

253
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,403
When is the wedding?

254
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,137
我要参加吗？

254
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,137
Am I to attend?

255
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:08,942
他们说，这已经发生在夜深人静的时候。

255
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:08,942
It happened already in
the dead of night, they say.

256
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:13,278
尽管如此，它还是需要庆祝的游戏。

256
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:13,278
Nonetheless, it calls
for games of celebration.

257
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,682
Flamma 将引领这场奇观。

257
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,682
Flamma will lead the spectacle.

258
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,852
他的对手，亲自选择

258
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,852
His opponent, chosen personally

259
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,988
作者：Aedile Ludi， Flavius Domitianus

259
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,988
by the Aedile Ludi,
Flavius Domitianus

260
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:26,092
不是别人，正是我们的小狮子杀手，

260
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:26,092
is no other than
our little Lion Killer,

261
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:27,527
夸。

261
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:27,527
Kwame.

262
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,798
当然，他需要一些帮助

262
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,798
He will, of course,
need some help

263
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,836
使它持续足够长的时间，可以称为娱乐。

263
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,836
to make it last long enough
to be called entertainment.

264
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,373
奥齐，普里齐，

264
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,373
Ozzi, Prizzi,

265
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:45,744
你将有幸与夸梅一起死在弗拉玛的手中。

265
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:45,744
you will have the honor of dying
with Kwame at Flamma's hands.

266
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,233
对不起，兄弟。

266
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,233
I am sorry, brother.

267
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,840
来

267
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,840
Come,

268
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:16,809
回到训练。

268
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:16,809
back to training.

269
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,779
我恨不得我的死让新皇后失望。

269
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,779
I would hate for my death to
disappoint the new empress.

270
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,951
你怎么能抛弃白人？

270
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,951
How could you desert the Whites?

271
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,054
Xenon 现在为蓝军开车。

271
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,054
Xenon drives for the Blues now.

272
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,890
你对我们派系的忠诚在哪里？

272
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,890
And where's your
loyalty to our faction?

273
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,660
我的忠诚与我的男人氙气在一起。

273
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,660
My loyalty is with my man Xenon.

274
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,961
他去哪里，我就去哪里。

274
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,961
Where he goes, I go.

275
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:40,232
好吧，你们俩将成为一对可爱的情侣。

275
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:40,232
Well, you two are going
to make a lovely couple.

276
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,670
但这场比赛是肯定的。

276
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,670
But this race is a sure thing.

277
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,704
绿党只经营马雷马诺母马，

277
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,704
The Greens run only
Maremano mares,

278
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,773
雨后无与伦比。

278
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,773
unbeatable after rainfall.

279
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,942
如果木星今晚打开天空，

279
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,942
If Jupiter opens
the skies tonight,

280
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,545
他会的，你会把你的钱增加三倍。

280
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,545
which he will, you'll
triple your money.

281
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,247
那为什么要告诉我这一切呢？

281
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,247
So why tell me all this?

282
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,083
好吧，酒馆里没有人会相信我的功劳。

282
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,083
Well, nobody in the
tavern will take my credit.

283
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,318
- 但是如果你在我面前 20 塞斯特斯...... - 对，对。

283
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,318
- But if you front me 20 sesterces...
- Right, right.

284
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,755
我正在努力帮助你。

284
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,755
I'm trying to help you.

285
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,923
就像你通过赌走她的财产来帮助你的妻子一样。

285
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,923
Like you helped your wife
by gambling away her fortune.

286
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:07,894
任何有眼睛的人都知道，种族是一个解决方案。

286
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:07,894
Anybody with eyes
knows that race was a fix.

287
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,997
Tenax 操了我以获得这些股份。

287
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,997
Tenax fucked me
to get those shares.

288
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,901
我警告过你这种谈话。

288
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,901
I warned you about
that sort of talk.

289
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,736
他是怎么让斯科普斯忍住的，嗯？

289
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,736
How did he get Scorpus
to hold back, huh?

290
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:17,903
我永远不会知道。

290
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:17,903
I'll never know.

291
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,972
Tenax 操了我以获得这些股份。

291
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,972
Tenax fucked me
to get those shares.

292
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:21,807
弄脏别人的地板

292
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:21,807
Stain someone else's floor

293
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,410
用你的血。

293
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,410
with your blood.

294
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,897
所以我听说你把你的派系股份输给了Tenax。

294
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,897
So I hear you lost your
faction shares to Tenax.

295
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,299
有人想和你说话。

295
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,299
Someone wants to speak to you.

296
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,435
来。

296
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,435
Come.

297
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,919
欢迎。

297
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,919
Welcome.

298
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,288
是鲁弗斯，是吗？

298
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,288
It's Rufus, yes?

299
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,893
我听说你和Tenax打过交道，

299
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,893
I'm told you've had
dealings with Tenax,

300
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,363
他们称之为苏布拉之王的那个。

300
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,363
the one they call the
King of the Suburra.

301
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,097
请坐。

301
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,097
Please, sit.

302
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,503
原谅我的外表。

302
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,503
Forgive my appearance.

303
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:28,407
我没想到会见到犹太人的女王。

303
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:28,407
I wasn't expecting an audience
with the Queen of the Jews.

304
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:32,945
我听说他操纵了比赛，偷走了你在蓝色派系的股份。

304
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:32,945
I'm told he rigged the race and
stole your shares of the Blue Faction.

305
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,481
当萨琳娜看到我的所作所为时，她眼中的羞愧。

305
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,481
The shame in Salena's eyes
when she saw what I'd done.

306
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,753
我美丽的儿子。

306
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,753
My beautiful son.

307
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:48,094
我突然想到，我们也许可以互相帮助。

307
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:48,094
It occurs to me that we may
be able to help one another.

308
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,431
一个问题。

308
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,431
A question.

309
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,601
你有没有在皇帝的兄弟的陪伴下见过这个Tenax？

309
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,601
Have you ever seen this Tenax in
the company of the Emperor's brother?

310
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:56,802
不是用我自己的眼睛。

310
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:56,802
Not with my own eyes.

311
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,005
但我被告知，Tenax是图密善的客户。

311
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,005
But I'm told that Tenax
is Domitian's client.

312
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,074
有传言说是图密善

312
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,074
Rumor has it that
it was Domitian

313
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,242
谁批准了特纳克斯的黄金派系。

313
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,242
who approved
Tenax's Gold Faction.

314
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,747
这就是你给我一把匕首的地方

314
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,747
This is where you
give me a dagger

315
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,416
让我割开特纳克斯的喉咙？

315
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,416
and ask me to
slit Tenax's throat?

316
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:13,686
我向你保证，有更有能力的人来完成这项任务。

316
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:13,686
I assure you there are more
competent man for that task.

317
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:15,989
我不希望你杀了Tenax。

317
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:15,989
I don't want you to kill Tenax.

318
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,259
我要你向他求工作。

318
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,259
I want you to ask him for work.

319
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,438
没关系。

319
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,438
It is all right.

320
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,807
告诉我你的名字。

320
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,807
Tell me your name.

321
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,552
阿伦，你去哪儿了？

321
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,552
Ahren, where have you been?

322
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,622
哦，你变大了。

322
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,622
Oh, you're getting big.

323
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:56,528
夸

323
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:56,528
Kwame,

324
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,964
有睡眠吗？

324
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,964
any sleep?

325
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:01,334
为什么要把最后的时光浪费在睡眠上？

325
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:01,334
Why waste my last
moments on sleep?

326
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,806
我的妻子林扎和我的儿子阿伦。

326
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,806
My wife, Linza,
and my son Ahren.

327
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,008
你会尊重我们的。

327
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,008
You would honor us.

328
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:10,309
请，请过来，坐。

328
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:10,309
Please, please come, sit.

329
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,551
我有两个姐妹也在罗马。

329
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,551
I have two sisters also in Rome.

330
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,355
我不会再见到他们了。

330
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,355
I won't see them again.

331
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:30,063
你丈夫打得很好。

331
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:30,063
Your husband fights well.

332
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,232
他会赢得木剑。

332
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,232
He will win the wooden sword.

333
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,067
所以我祈祷。

333
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,067
So I pray.

334
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,170
当我这样做时，

334
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,170
And when I do,

335
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,506
我们三个人将返回武里。

335
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,506
the three of us
will return to Buri.

336
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,575
我父亲在那里给我留下了一个农场。

336
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,575
My father left me a farm there.

337
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,210
鹅，几只山羊。

337
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,210
Geese, a couple of goats.

338
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,645
我和琳扎会同时繁殖，

338
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,645
Me and Linza will breed both,

339
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:50,884
还有我们自己，生了更多的孩子，很多。

339
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:50,884
and ourselves as well, making
more babies, lots of them.

340
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,260
你想成为大哥吗？

340
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,260
Would you like to
be a big brother?

341
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,887
是的，你会是一个好大哥。

341
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,887
Yes, you'd be a
good big brother.

342
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,159
向众神祈求的一件好事。

342
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,159
A good thing to
ask the Gods for.

343
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:01,661
婴儿、鹅和山羊。

343
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:01,661
Babies, geese and goats.

344
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:06,465
不，我......

344
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:06,465
No, I...

345
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:10,170
我请求众神保护你，我的兄弟。

345
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:10,170
I ask the Gods to
protect you, my brother.

346
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,310
你浪费了对众神的恳求

346
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,310
You waste an
entreaty to the Gods

347
00:31:18,678 --> 00:31:19,678
给我的？

347
00:31:18,678 --> 00:31:19,678
for me?

348
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:21,914
不浪费。

348
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:21,914
Not wasted.

349
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:29,088
也许有一天我会参观你的农场

349
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:29,088
Perhaps one day
I will visit your farm

350
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,557
并认识你的孩子。

350
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,557
and meet your children.

351
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,260
别忘了山羊。

351
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,260
And don't forget the goats.

352
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,306
它的疯狂。

352
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,306
The madness of it.

353
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,409
提多娶了他的表妹。

353
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,409
Titus married his cousin.

354
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,578
省级什么都没有。

354
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,578
Provincial nothing.

355
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:00,286
要是我认识一个人就好了，

355
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:00,286
If only I knew a man,

356
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:03,189
未稀释的贵族血统，

356
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:03,189
undiluted Patrician blood,

357
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,724
谁可能会登上铜椅。

357
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,724
who might ascend
the curule chair.

358
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,962
一个有着辉煌军事记录的人，

358
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,962
Someone with a
brilliant military record,

359
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,432
对命令感到满意。

359
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,432
comfortable with command.

360
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,201
我们以前跳过这个舞，安东尼娅。

360
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,201
We've done this
dance before, Antonia.

361
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,403
从这里到亚历山大港的每一位贵族

361
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,403
Every Patrician from
here to Alexandria

362
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:20,105
已经跳了这支舞，现在正在做。

362
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:20,105
has done this dance
and is doing it now.

363
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:22,474
参议院在危机时刻向你求助。

363
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:22,474
The Senate turns to
you in moments of crisis.

364
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:25,345
他们中的许多人会为了看到你在铜椅上而杀人。

364
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:25,345
Many of them will kill to
see you on the curule chair.

365
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,013
小心。我们在自己家里说的话是一回事，

365
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,013
Careful. What we say inside
our own home is one thing,

366
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,915
但这样的对话在这些墙外

366
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,915
but such a conversation
outside these walls

367
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:32,018
是无法解铸的骰子。

367
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:32,018
is a die that cannot be uncast.

368
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:36,522
你不确定我是否能成为一个好皇后吗？

368
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:36,522
Are you unsure if I were
to make a good empress?

369
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,826
亲爱的，这是我确信的一件事。

369
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,826
That, my dear, is the one
thing of which I am sure.

370
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,695
皇后。多么可爱的词。

370
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,695
Empress. What a lovely word.

371
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,565
但不如皇帝可爱。

371
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,565
But not as lovely as Emperor.

372
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,133
嘘！

372
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,133
Shh!

373
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,068
内战是有代价的。

373
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,068
The Civil War comes at a cost.

374
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:53,339
参议员们，甚至是我阵营的参议员们，都记得这一点。

374
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:53,339
Senators, even those in
my camp, remember that.

375
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,917
火灾发生后，元老院和暴徒都反对尼禄。

375
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,917
The Senate and the mob both
turned against Nero after the fires.

376
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:57,609
火灾？

376
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:57,609
Fires?

377
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:00,613
你会把火炬点燃罗马，以满足我们的野心。

377
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:00,613
You'd put a torch to Rome
to satisfy our ambition.

378
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:03,549
为了你，为了我们的儿子

378
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:03,549
For you and for our son

379
00:33:04,017 --> 00:33:05,585
为了我们的家庭，

379
00:33:04,017 --> 00:33:05,585
and for our family,

380
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:08,488
我会烧毁整个该死的帝国。

380
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:08,488
I'd burn down the
entire fucking empire.

381
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:13,093
如果我牺牲了这座城市，我会成为什么样的皇帝

381
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:13,093
What kind of emperor would
I be if I sacrificed the city

382
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:14,760
获得对它的统治权？

382
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:14,760
to obtain dominion over it?

383
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:18,365
我们不需要火。

383
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:18,365
We don't need a fire.

384
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:22,234
我们只需要一个火花。

384
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:22,234
We just need a spark.

385
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,416
谢谢你，亲爱的。

385
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,416
Thank you, my dear.

386
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,457
出去。

386
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,457
Get out.

387
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,226
- 我们可以谈谈吗？- 我说出去。

387
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,226
- May we speak?
- I said get out.

388
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:48,161
- 拜托，我...- 如果这是关于股份的

388
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:48,161
- Please, I...
- If this is about the shares

389
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,462
不管你认为我做了什么来得到他们，

389
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,462
and whatever you
think I did to get them,

390
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:52,198
不要浪费你的呼吸。

390
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:52,198
don't waste your breath.

391
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,500
我是来找你的工作的。

391
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,500
I'm here to ask you for work.

392
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,902
- 做什么？- 您需要的任何东西。

392
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,902
- Doing what?
- Anything you need.

393
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,103
没有人会雇用我。

393
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,103
Nobody else will hire me.

394
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,138
这是有充分理由的。

394
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,138
For a good reason.

395
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:01,074
我少喝酒，从不偷东西。

395
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:01,074
I drink less and never steal.

396
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,278
至少从你那里。

396
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,278
At least from you.

397
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,114
我从比你强壮得多的人那里听说过。

397
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,114
I've heard that from much
stronger men than you.

398
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,481
我向我的儿子发誓。

398
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,481
I swear it on my son.

399
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:11,150
一个好的誓言，

399
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:11,150
A good oath,

400
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,485
但不是来自傻瓜。

400
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,485
but not from a fool.

401
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,521
Tenax，拜托了。

401
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,521
Tenax, please.

402
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,757
我求求你了，拜托了。

402
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,757
I beg you, please.

403
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:30,969
每天三杯

403
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:30,969
Three sesterces a day

404
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,139
她说什么你就做什么。

404
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,139
and you do whatever she says.

405
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,974
谢谢你，Tenax...

405
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,974
Thank you, Tenax...

406
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,775
如果你从我这里偷东西，

406
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,775
If you steal from me,

407
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:40,380
我会砍掉你的手，把它们卖给卡波。

407
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:40,380
I will cut off your hands
and sell them to Carpo.

408
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:45,751
谢谢。

408
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:45,751
Thank you.

409
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,893
妈妈！

409
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,893
Mother!

410
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,467
这是什么？这是什么？

410
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,467
What is it? What is it?

411
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,204
妈妈，夸梅。

411
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,204
Mama, Kwame.

412
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:08,574
夸。

412
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:08,574
Kwame.

413
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:10,976
你知道吗？

413
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:10,976
Did you know about this?

414
00:35:11,077 --> 00:35:12,411
不。

414
00:35:11,077 --> 00:35:12,411
No.

415
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:14,981
我能做些什么？

415
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:14,981
What can I do?

416
00:35:15,081 --> 00:35:16,548
没有办法阻止它。

416
00:35:15,081 --> 00:35:16,548
There's no stopping it.

417
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,684
不是现在。

417
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,684
Not now.

418
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,387
它已经发布，他们已经在集结区了。

418
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,387
It has been posted, they'll
already be at the staging area.

419
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,088
一切都是有代价的。

419
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,088
Everything has a price.

420
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,592
不是这个。不是现在。

420
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,592
Not this. Not now.

421
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:26,525
但你认识人。

421
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:26,525
But you know people.

422
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:27,936
你有影响力，你可以做到。

422
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:27,936
You have influence
and you can do it.

423
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,699
如果我是皇帝本人，我现在无法阻止这一切。

423
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,699
Were I the Emperor himself,
I couldn't stop this now.

424
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,603
暴徒闻到了血腥味。

424
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,603
The mob smells blood.

425
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:44,677
我能见到他吗？

425
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:44,677
Can I see him?

426
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:05,498
我们向提图斯皇帝致敬

426
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:05,498
We hail the Emperor Titus

427
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,900
和他的新婚妻子玛西娅皇后。

427
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,900
and his new wife,
the Empress Marcia.

428
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,539
皇帝很高兴地宣布

428
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,539
The Emperor is
pleased to announce

429
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,306
经过数周的饥荒，

429
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,306
that after weeks of famine,

430
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,476
他已经填满了粮仓。

430
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,476
he has filled the granaries.

431
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:21,514
罗马市民将不再挨饿！

431
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:21,514
The citizens of Rome
will go hungry no more!

432
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:24,617
为了纪念他的新婚妻子玛西娅，

432
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:24,617
And in honor of his
new wife, Marcia,

433
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:28,954
他提供了一个特别的游戏日！

433
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:28,954
he offers a special
day of games!

434
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,458
表哥，很高兴再次见到你。

434
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,458
Cousin, good to see you again.

435
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,492
你来得正好，正好赶上看弗拉玛

435
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,492
You arrived just in
time to watch Flamma

436
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:35,061
为了你的荣誉杀死三个人。

436
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:35,061
slay three men in your honor.

437
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:38,797
同样为了纪念你，我暂停了对图密善的监禁。

437
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:38,797
Also in your honor, I have
suspended Domitian's confinement.

438
00:36:38,898 --> 00:36:40,934
我们可以一起享受光荣的一天。

438
00:36:38,898 --> 00:36:40,934
Together, we can enjoy
a glorious day of games.

439
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,103
谢谢。

439
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,103
My thanks.

440
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,304
我可以把我的两只看门狗留在我身边。

440
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,304
I get to keep my two
watchdogs by my side.

441
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,773
顺便一提

441
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,773
By the way,

442
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,809
那是我妻子的座位。

442
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,809
that's my wife's seat.

443
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,605
让她通过。

443
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,605
Let her through.

444
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,547
儿子。

444
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,547
Son.

445
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:30,650
妈妈？

445
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:30,650
Mother?

446
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,722
光环，她是自由的。

446
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,722
Aura, she's free.

447
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,925
- 很快，朱拉也会。-好。

447
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,925
- Soon, Jula will be too.
- Good.

448
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,429
你。。。

448
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,429
You...

449
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,297
你会赢得这场战斗。

449
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,297
You are going to win this fight.

450
00:37:45,398 --> 00:37:47,766
然后我们就可以一起回家了。

450
00:37:45,398 --> 00:37:47,766
Then we can all
go home together.

451
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:50,969
无论发生什么，我都想把事情做到最好。

451
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:50,969
Whatever happens, I want
to make the best of things.

452
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,840
不，不，不，不，不，不，不。

452
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

453
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,608
看着我。我。

453
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,608
Look at me. Me.

454
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,679
你出生的那一天，

454
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,679
The day you were born,

455
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,916
你父亲看了你一眼，说：

455
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,916
your father took one
look at you and said,

456
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:09,621
“狮头神阿佩德马克的灵魂住在我们的儿子身上。”

456
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:09,621
"The spirit of Apedemak, the
lion-headed god, lives in our son."

457
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,793
他总是比我更迷信。

457
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,793
He was always more
superstitious than me.

458
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:18,364
老实说，我认为这完全是胡说八道。

458
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:18,364
Honestly, I thought
that was utter nonsense.

459
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,336
但现在我可以看到它了。

459
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,336
But now I can see it.

460
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,074
我看到了。

460
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,074
I see it.

461
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:34,748
就像你手中的三叉戟一样清晰。

461
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:34,748
As clearly as that
trident in your hand.

462
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:40,052
他们希望你做这是一件可怕的事情，

462
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:40,052
It is a terrible thing
they expect you to do,

463
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,121
但你必须这样做。

463
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,121
but you must do it.

464
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,490
我知道，母亲。

464
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,490
I know, Mother.

465
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,626
当你到达沙滩时，

465
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,626
When you reach the sand,

466
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,661
不要停下来。

466
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,661
do not stop.

467
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:51,630
不要放弃，直到他们把你从他身上拉下来。

467
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:51,630
Do not give up until
they pull you off him.

468
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:53,699
我不会停下来。

468
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:53,699
I won't stop.

469
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,635
然后我们会再次见面。

469
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,635
Then we will see
each other again.

470
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,909
说吧，夸梅。

470
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,909
Say it, Kwame.

471
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:08,815
盖茨。

471
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:08,815
Gates.

472
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:12,985
我会再见到你的。

472
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:12,985
I will see you again.

473
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:14,119
说啊。

473
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:14,119
Say it.

474
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:16,755
我会再见到你的。

474
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:16,755
I will see you again.

475
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:18,425
说啊！

475
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:18,425
Say it!

476
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:23,929
我会再见到你的。

476
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:23,929
I will see you again.

477
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:26,865
我们必须走了。

477
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:26,865
We must go.

478
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,702
去。

478
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,702
Go.

479
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,708
你是保护我们家庭的狮子。

479
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,708
You are the lion that
protects our family.

480
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:40,480
弗拉玛！弗拉玛！

480
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:40,480
Flamma! Flamma!

481
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:04,503
弗拉玛！弗拉玛！

481
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:04,503
Flamma! Flamma!

482
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:10,543
弗拉玛！弗拉玛！

482
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:10,543
Flamma! Flamma!

483
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,820
我们这些即将死去的人，

483
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,820
We who are about to die,

484
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,023
向你致敬。

484
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,023
salute you.

485
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:29,561
将它们链接起来。

485
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:29,561
Chain them.

486
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:32,599
这是怎麽？

486
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:32,599
What is this?

487
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:33,699
-移动！-来。来。

487
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:33,699
- Move!
- Come. Come.

488
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,302
弗拉玛！弗拉玛！

488
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,302
Flamma! Flamma!

489
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:40,907
留在中间。

489
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:40,907
Stay in the middle.

490
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:44,043
对于我们今天的最后一场比赛，

490
00:40:41,007 --> 00:40:44,043
For our final bout today,

491
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:45,945
伟大的弗拉玛

491
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:45,945
the great Flamma

492
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:50,083
将与一支只在神话中为人所知的力量作战。

492
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:50,083
will do battle with a
force known only in myth.

493
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:54,487
来自塞壬群岛的邪恶网人。

493
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:54,487
The wicked net men
from the Siren Islands.

494
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:18,844
角斗士。。。

494
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:18,844
Gladiators...

495
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:22,849
准备！

495
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:22,849
Ready!

496
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:28,554
聘！

496
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:28,554
Engage!

497
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,891
嘿！简单，兄弟！

497
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,891
Hey! Easy, brother!

498
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:34,293
待在一起。

498
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:34,293
Stay together.

499
00:41:36,362 --> 00:41:37,396
加油！

499
00:41:36,362 --> 00:41:37,396
Come on!

500
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:36,623
来，来吧。

500
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:36,623
Here, come on.

501
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:46,099
稳住，我亲爱的朋友，稳住。

501
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:46,099
Steady, my dear friend, steady.

502
00:43:15,494 --> 00:43:19,164
众神表示了他们的恩惠。我就知道。

502
00:43:15,494 --> 00:43:19,164
The Gods show
their favor. I knew it.

503
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:45,657
不 不。

503
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:45,657
No, no.

504
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:47,126
对不起，兄弟。

504
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:47,126
I'm sorry, brother.

505
00:43:56,268 --> 00:43:57,302
水。

505
00:43:56,268 --> 00:43:57,302
Water.

506
00:43:58,038 --> 00:44:00,172
皇后脸色苍白。

506
00:43:58,038 --> 00:44:00,172
The Empress is
looking rather pale.

507
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:02,275
也许有人也找到了我哥哥。

507
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:02,275
Perhaps someone's
found my brother as well.

508
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:12,052
夸！夸！夸！

508
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:12,052
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

509
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:13,385
不！

509
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:13,385
No!

510
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:15,688
小个子，他表现出极大的勇气

510
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:15,688
The small one, he
shows great valor

511
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,222
面对一定的失败。

511
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,222
in the face of certain defeat.

512
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,559
看到这样的美德在体育运动中被浪费了，真是可惜。

512
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,559
It's pity to see such
virtue wasted in sport.

513
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:21,027
看看他的美德如何为他服务

513
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:21,027
See how his virtue serves him

514
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:23,429
当弗拉玛用剑刺穿他的心脏时。

514
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:23,429
when Flamma puts a
sword through his heart.

515
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:59,065
你是保护我们家庭的狮子。

515
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:59,065
You are the lion that
protects our family.

516
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:46,846
加油！

516
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:46,846
Come on!

517
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:16,242
夸！夸！夸！

517
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:16,242
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

518
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,952
游戏在你之下，但现在你却在权衡。

518
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,952
The games are so beneath
you, yet now you weigh in.

519
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:01,954
毅力值得肯定。

519
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:01,954
Perseverance
deserves recognition.

520
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,557
无论场地多么卑微。

520
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,557
No matter how lowly the venue.

521
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,293
我很好奇。

521
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,293
I'm curious.

522
00:47:07,393 --> 00:47:10,530
砍掉战友的腿属于什么武德？

522
00:47:07,393 --> 00:47:10,530
What martial virtue does cutting
your comrade's leg off fall under?

523
00:47:23,076 --> 00:47:25,110
这是怎么回事？

523
00:47:23,076 --> 00:47:25,110
What's going on?

524
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,023
在他的第一场比赛中赢得了暴徒的青睐

524
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,023
Winning the favor of the
mob in his first contest

525
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:28,414
这可不是一件小事。

525
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:28,414
is no small feat.

526
00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:30,416
兆头。

526
00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:30,416
Bodes well.

527
00:47:30,884 --> 00:47:32,251
他们能释放他吗？

527
00:47:30,884 --> 00:47:32,251
Might they free him?

528
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:34,387
不。

528
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:34,387
No.

529
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:36,623
他们会想看他一次又一次地战斗。

529
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:36,623
They'll want to watch
him fight again and again.

530
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:39,659
如果他幸运的话，他会建立一个追随者，

530
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:39,659
If he's lucky, he'll
build a following,

531
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:42,262
更好的对手，更好的赔率。

531
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:42,262
better opponents, better odds.

532
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:44,496
也许我匆匆忙忙地和他打赌。

532
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:44,496
Perhaps I was hasty
to bet against him.

533
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:47,000
你在我儿子身上有血钱？

533
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:47,000
You had blood money on my son?

534
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,902
这里是罗马，

534
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,902
This is Rome,

535
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:51,438
都是血钱。

535
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:51,438
it's all blood money.

536
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:15,561
今天比平时更近。

536
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:15,561
Closer than usual today.

537
00:48:16,528 --> 00:48:18,331
特别是对你来说，不是吗？

537
00:48:16,528 --> 00:48:18,331
Especially for you, no?

538
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,001
我的皇帝，皇后。

538
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,001
My Emperor, Empress.

539
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:26,873
兄弟，你为什么不给失败者

539
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:26,873
Brother, why do you
not bestow the loser

540
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:28,507
带着他的安慰奖？

540
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:28,507
with his consolation prize?

541
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:18,657
找掩护。

541
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:18,657
Take cover.

542
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:45,751
你向众神祈求火花。

542
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:45,751
You ask the Gods for a spark.

543
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:49,054
有你的火花。

543
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:49,054
There is your spark.
