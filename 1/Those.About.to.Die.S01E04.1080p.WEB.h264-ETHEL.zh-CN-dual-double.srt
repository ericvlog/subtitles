1
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:11,410
有史以来第一次，

1
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:11,410
For the first time in history,

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,278
黄金阵营！

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,278
the Gold Faction!

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,446
驾！

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,446
Hyah!

4
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:21,286
两千塞斯特斯换我女儿奥拉的自由

4
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:21,286
Two thousand sesterces for
my daughter Aura's freedom.

5
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:23,455
上帝保佑

5
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:23,455
By the Gods.

6
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:28,327
罗马的皇帝必须站着死去才能成为神。

6
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:28,327
An Emperor of Rome must
die standing to become divine.

7
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:56,289
死了多少人

7
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:56,289
How many dead?

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,627
约200 μ战斗仍在郊区继续。

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,627
About 200. Fighting still
continues in the Suburra.

9
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,463
我父亲的葬礼？

9
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,463
My father's funeral?

10
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,632
明天可以继续了。

10
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,632
Safe to go ahead tomorrow.

11
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,140
参议员们

11
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,140
Senators.

12
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,942
我认为这些游戏的目的

12
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,942
I thought the intention
of these games

13
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,210
是为了安抚民众而不是激怒他们

13
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,210
was to calm the
citizens, not inflame them.

14
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,546
问题是这个新的黄金派系。

14
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,546
The problem is this
new Gold Faction.

15
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:24,016
只有我们四个的时候一切都很稳定。

15
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:24,016
Things were stable when
we were just the four of us.

16
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,493
当一个新的派系

16
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,493
What do you expect
when a new faction

17
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,920
是一个平民和该死的叙利亚人的

17
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,920
is owned by a plebeian
and a damned Syrian.

18
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,823
它给了较低层次的想法。

18
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,823
It gives the lower orders ideas.

19
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,192
你有什么建议

19
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,192
So, what do you counsel?

20
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,259
很简单，结束黄金阵营。

20
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,259
Simple, end the Gold Faction.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,262
有趣.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,262
Interesting.

22
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:40,465
先把这个放一边。

22
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:40,465
Let's put that aside
for one moment.

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,370
我有个更大的问题希望你能给点建议。

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,370
I have a greater concern about
which I would welcome your input.

24
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,237
这是从国王时代开始的

24
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,237
This is since the
time of the kings

25
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:50,710
只有三个罗马人，朱利叶斯·凯撒，凯撒·奥古斯都和克劳迪亚斯

25
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:50,710
only three Romans, Julius Caesar,
Caesar Augustus and Claudius have been

26
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,513
被神化，被宣布为神。

26
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,513
deified, declared Gods.

27
00:01:56,015 --> 00:02:01,153
我的父亲维斯帕先大帝也应该被神化

27
00:01:56,015 --> 00:02:01,153
My father, the Great Emperor
Vespasian, should, too, be deified,

28
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:04,290
并以神的身份加入他们

28
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:04,290
and join them as a God.

29
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:09,829
這是一個大膽的要求。

29
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:09,829
That's a bold request.

30
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,667
牧師和螺旋鑽告訴我們他已經贏得了他應有的地位

30
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,667
The priests and augers tell us
that he has earned his rightful place

31
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,300
在不朽者中。

31
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,300
among the Immortals.

32
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,104
就像你的四個派系

32
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,104
Just as your four
factions have earned you

33
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:23,308
馬克西姆斯馬戲團的獨家經營權

33
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:23,308
the exclusive right to
run at Circus Maximus.

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,215
我向神父們鞠躬。

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,215
I bow to the priests.

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,185
我們會在參議院

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,185
And we'll move in the Senate

36
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:34,387
將維斯帕先皇帝奉為神明

36
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:34,387
to deify the Emperor Vespasian.

37
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,688
我也會。

37
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,688
As will I.

38
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,194
看起來怎麼樣？

38
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,194
How does it look?

39
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,763
- 黃金！- 一面旗幟！

39
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,763
- Gold!
- A flag!

40
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,472
打倒那些人！

40
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,472
Down with those!

41
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,409
奉提圖斯·凱撒·維斯帕西亞努斯皇帝之命

41
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,409
By order of Emperor
Titus Caesar Vespasianus,

42
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,646
允許在馬克西姆斯馬戲團跑步

42
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,646
permission to run
in Circus Maximus

43
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,549
特此退出黃金陣營

43
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,549
is hereby withdrawn
from the Gold Faction.

44
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,384
走吧

44
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,384
Let's go.

45
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,722
方索阿等等

45
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,722
Fonsoa, wait!

46
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,563
- 冷靜點- 冷靜？

46
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,563
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

47
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,632
我不幹了。

47
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,632
I quit the Blue.

48
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,170
我告訴馬蘇斯和安東尼婭去死吧。

48
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,170
I told Marsus and Antonia
to go fuck themselves.

49
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,014
他們干自己總比你干她好。

49
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,014
Better they fuck
themselves than you fuck her.

50
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,240
不，不別開玩笑。

50
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,240
No, no, don't make jokes.

51
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,610
我是被你操的人。

51
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,610
I am the one being
fucked by you.

52
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:36,348
阿塔加提斯，我為什麼要聽這個羅馬傻瓜的話？

52
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:36,348
Atargatis, why did I
listen to this Roman fool?

53
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,819
天蠍座是羅馬最好的車手，有史以來最好的，

53
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,819
Scorpus is the best
driver in Rome, best ever,

54
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,322
史上最高薪酬

54
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,322
highest paid in history.

55
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:45,224
我就为了这场“黄金秀”放弃了这一切？

55
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:45,224
And I threw it all away
for this "golden shitshow"?

56
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:48,260
天蝎座，冷静点。

56
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:48,260
Scorpus, settle yourself.

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,796
你的伟大毋庸置疑。

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,796
Your greatness
goes unquestioned.

58
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:51,896
我能解决的

58
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:51,896
I can fix this.

59
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,633
我想这些是我的战车。

59
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,633
I believe these are my chariots.

60
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,407
加夫罗斯？

60
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,407
Gavros?

61
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,713
啊，白色！

61
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,713
Ah, White!

62
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,750
立刻带他们出去。

62
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,750
Take them out immediately.

63
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,752
等等不，不！

63
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,752
Wait. No, no!

64
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,124
埃利亚安静！和平！

64
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,124
Elia! Peace! Peace!

65
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:21,427
你们只不过是普通的小偷！

65
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:21,427
You're nothing more
than common thieves!

66
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,762
- 我花钱买的。- 我也是

66
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,762
- I paid for those.
- So did I.

67
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,672
其实我没付钱

67
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,672
Well, I didn't
actually pay for them.

68
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,841
但我一直在考虑。

68
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,841
But I was thinking about it.

69
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,810
我受够了

69
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,810
I'm done.

70
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,648
天蝎座不再有黄金阵营。

70
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,648
No more Gold
Faction for Scorpus.

71
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,615
我不玩了

71
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,615
I'm out.

72
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,518
出去！

72
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,518
Out!

73
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,685
凭借诸神的恩典和力量，

73
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,685
By the grace and
power of the Gods,

74
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:03,322
我们加冕提图斯·弗拉维乌斯·维斯帕西亚努斯

74
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:03,322
we crown Titus
Flavius Vespasianus,

75
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,858
罗马的领袖和皇帝。

75
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,858
Leader and Emperor of Rome.

76
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,295
那些女人是谁

76
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,295
Who are those women?

77
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,464
维斯塔尔家族，

77
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,464
The Vestal Virgins,

78
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:15,668
罗马永恒火焰的守护者

78
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:15,668
guardians of
Rome's eternal flame,

79
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,807
没有接触过，未婚，只为城市所爱

79
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,807
untouched, unmarried,
loved only by the city itself.

80
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,209
他们有强大的力量。

80
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,209
They have great powers.

81
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,082
他们中的一个人只要看一眼就能救一个被判死刑的人。

81
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,082
A mere look from one of them
can save a condemned man.

82
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:33,653
一触即解放奴隶。

82
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:33,653
A touch can set a slave free.

83
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,661
我是她的证人。

83
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,661
That one, I was her witness.

84
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,596
她是我情妇安东尼娅的女儿。

84
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,596
She's the daughter of
my mistress Antonia.

85
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,766
她只有七岁

85
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,766
She was only seven

86
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,569
她就死了

86
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,569
when the Vestals took her.

87
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:53,973
她哭着恳求父母不要把她送走。

87
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:53,973
She cried, begging her
parents not to give her away.

88
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,043
一个母亲怎么能这么做？

88
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,043
How could a mother do that?

89
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,795
神父，我不想冒犯你。但你疯了吗？

89
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,795
Father, I don't wish to
offend you. But are you mad?

90
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,764
对尿液征税？

90
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,764
A tax on urine?

91
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,865
这不是对尿液征税，

91
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,865
It's not a tax on urine,

92
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,103
这是对尿液的销售征税。

92
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,103
it is a tax on
the sale of urine.

93
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,406
尿液呈白色，

93
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,406
Urine bleaches white,

94
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,608
我们穿的衣服你明白吗？

94
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,608
the clothes that we
wear. Do you understand?

95
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,681
钱，闻闻。

95
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,681
Money, smell it.

96
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,584
算了吧。

96
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,584
Smell it.

97
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,455
你觉得这味道难闻吗？

97
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,455
Do you find that
smell offensive?

98
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,624
- 它没有气味。- 没错

98
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,624
- It has no smell.
- Precisely.

99
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,794
钱，它支付我们的军团。

99
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,794
Money, it pays for our legions.

100
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:51,898
它帮助我们为公民提供健康的沐浴，

100
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:51,898
It helps us supply our citizens
with baths for their health,

101
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,969
这样他们就不会起来割破我们的喉咙

101
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,969
so that they don't rise
up and slit our throats.

102
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,005
钱

102
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,005
Money.

103
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,711
一个皇帝，即使是未来的皇帝，

103
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,711
An emperor, even
a prospective one,

104
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:09,081
知道钱不臭。

104
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:09,081
knows that money does not stink.

105
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,817
它可以建立你的遗产。

105
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,817
It can build your legacy.

106
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,725
兄弟兄弟

106
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,725
Brother. Brother.

107
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,673
罗马人，

107
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,673
Romans,

108
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,344
我，泰特斯·弗拉维乌斯·韦斯帕西安，

108
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,344
I, Titus Flavius Vespasian,

109
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,613
站在你面前，一个皇帝，

109
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,613
stand before you, an emperor,

110
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,216
将军，

110
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,216
general,

111
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,784
还有一个悲伤的儿子

111
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,784
and a grieving son.

112
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,489
我父亲把弗拉维安圆形剧场给了你

112
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,489
My father gave you
the Flavian Amphitheater

113
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,024
举办世界上最伟大的运动会

113
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,024
to hold the greatest
games on Earth.

114
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,028
我的遗产，

114
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,028
My legacy,

115
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:02,235
我将重建现在已成废墟的处女座水道。

115
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:02,235
I shall reconstruct the
Aqueduct Virgo now in ruin.

116
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,873
水会为每个罗马人的利益而流动。

116
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,873
Water will flow for the
benefit of every Roman.

117
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:11,076
再一次，我会给你最好的公共浴池

117
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:11,076
And once more, I will give
you the greatest public baths

118
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,080
人类所见过的。

118
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,080
ever seen by man.

119
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,527
把所有东西都搬进去。

119
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,527
Move everything in.

120
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,761
是的，我的女王。

120
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,761
Yes, my queen.

121
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,764
是的，把那个和这个拿来，女士们。

121
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,764
Yes, bring that one
and this one, women.

122
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,899
是的，先吃这个，继续。

122
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,899
Yes, this one first, go
on, go ahead, go ahead.

123
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,072
- 我能和你说句话吗，亲爱的？- 能等等吗

123
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,072
- May I have a word, my love?
- Can it wait?

124
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:47,246
告诉我，谁来为你建造这些浴场重塑罗马？

124
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:47,246
Tell me, who is going to build these
baths and remake Rome for you?

125
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,914
我们以后再谈这个。

125
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,914
We'll talk about that later.

126
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:52,751
你答应过我你成为皇帝后会释放我的人民

126
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:52,751
You promised you would free my
people after you became Emperor,

127
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,222
但我现在明白你并不想这么做

127
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,222
but I see now you had
no intention of doing so.

128
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:01,126
你寻求这样的承诺，我从来没有给过。

128
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:01,126
You sought such a
promise, I never gave it.

129
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,697
没说得这么清楚

129
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,697
Not in so many words.

130
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,398
我的话很准确。

130
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,398
My words were precise.

131
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,832
我告诉过你我会做的

131
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,832
I told you I would do it

132
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,701
如果这是为了罗马的利益

132
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,701
if it was in the
interest of Rome.

133
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,202
但我看到的不是这样。

133
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,202
A vision has told me otherwise.

134
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,671
幻象？

134
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,671
A vision?

135
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,548
是的，我父亲在至福乐土和我说话，

135
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,548
Yes, my father spoke to
me from the Elysian Fields,

136
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,551
让我为罗马的荣耀建造这些浴场

136
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,551
told me to build these
baths for the glory of Rome.

137
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,244
因此，我很高兴能利用你的人。

137
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,244
As such, it pleases me to
use your people to that end.

138
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,345
你骗了我

138
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,345
You lied to me.

139
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,024
如你所说后

139
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,024
As you said. Later.

140
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,504
骚乱已被平息。

140
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,504
The rioting has been quelled.

141
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:48,908
但现在人们担心粮仓会再次空无一物，

141
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:48,908
But there is now fear that the
granaries will be empty again,

142
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,846
粮食是故意延迟的

142
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,846
that the grain was
delayed intentionally.

143
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,850
有传言说食物短缺的幕后黑手是弗拉维安人。

143
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,850
And rumors that a Flavian
was behind the food shortages.

144
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,650
个...弗拉维安？

144
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,650
A... A Flavian?

145
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,922
那不可能是父亲，当然也不是我

145
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,922
That's impossible that it was
Father, and certainly not me,

146
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,091
那就剩下...

146
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,091
and that leaves...

147
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,163
你有所隐瞒。

147
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,163
You're holding something back.

148
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,466
你有两个缺点。

148
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,466
You have two faults.

149
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,034
什么，只有两个？

149
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,034
What, only two?

150
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,202
两个重要的。

150
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,202
Two that matter.

151
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:20,706
你爱你的女主人爱得太深了，

151
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:20,706
You love your mistress
more than you should,

152
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,777
你对你哥哥的信任超过了你应该信任的程度

152
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,777
and you trust your brother
more than you ought.

153
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,783
第一个错误，嗯...

153
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,783
The first fault, um...

154
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,317
那是我的事。

154
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,317
that is my affair.

155
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,423
至于我哥哥，好吧，我爱他，真的，但我不是傻瓜。

155
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,423
As for my brother, well, I
love him, true, but I am no fool.

156
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,327
你认为他是粮食延误和暴乱的幕后黑手？

156
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,327
You think him behind the
grain delays, behind the riots?

157
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,797
有传言说。

157
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,797
There are rumors.

158
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,238
看看是否有实质内容。

158
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,238
Find out if there's
substance to them.

159
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,980
我们有麻烦了

159
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,980
We have a problem.

160
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,393
下一个，来吧。200赌瑞德。

160
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,393
Next, come on.
Two hundred on Red.

161
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,994
我们至少有20个。

161
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,994
We got 20 at least.

162
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,962
Saranta Leuko.

162
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,962
Saranta Leuko.

163
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,201
- Sorenkto！- 萨兰塔

163
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,201
- Sorenkto!
- Saranta?

164
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,537
萨兰塔·利科？

164
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,537
Saranta Leuko?

165
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,971
四十押白色。

165
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,971
Forty on white.

166
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,541
走！喊出你的赌注。我说了让开！

166
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,541
Move! Shout your
bets. I said move!

167
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,109
动

167
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,109
Move.

168
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,278
喊出你的赌注！

168
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,278
Shout out your bets!

169
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,578
我说了让开。

169
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,578
I said move.

170
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,947
给我50

170
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,947
Give me 50.

171
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,453
100赌蓝色

171
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,453
One hundred on blue.

172
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,360
50赌蓝色

172
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,360
Fifty on blue.

173
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,804
殿下

173
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,804
Your Highness.

174
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,083
是其他老板说服我哥哥除掉黄金派的。

174
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,083
It was the other owners that convinced
my brother to get rid of the Gold Faction.

175
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,211
我也这么想。你能让我们复职吗？

175
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,211
I thought as much. Can
you get us reinstated?

176
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,311
也许吧

176
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,311
Perhaps.

177
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,315
我需要你先做件事。

177
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,315
There is something
I need you to do first.

178
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,619
你的前任，我的幕后黑手。

178
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,619
Your predecessor,
my doer of dark deeds.

179
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:24,356
- 一个叫卢修斯的- 我很不幸遇见了他。

179
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:24,356
- A certain Lucius.
- I've had the misfortune of meeting him.

180
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,126
他并不像我们希望的那样深藏在暗处。

180
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,126
He was not as deep in the
shadows as we might have hoped.

181
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,528
我要你掩盖他的踪迹。

181
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,528
I need you to
obscure his tracks.

182
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,167
他们把粮食短缺和粮食骚乱归咎于你。

182
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,167
They blame you for the grain
shortages and the food riots.

183
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:41,106
还没有，但怀疑离指责也不远了.

183
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:41,106
Not yet, but suspicion is
a short step from blame.

184
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,110
我来处理。这是我的荣幸。

184
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,110
I'll take care of it.
It'll be my pleasure.

185
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,548
尽你所能让我们的黄金阵营再次恢复。

185
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,548
And do what you can to get
our Gold Faction reinstated again.

186
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,286
这听起来更像是一个命令。

186
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,286
That sounded rather
like a command.

187
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,657
你是我的客户不是我的搭档

187
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,657
You're my client,
not my partner.

188
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:02,327
你为我的利益服务，希望我屈尊为你服务。

188
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:02,327
You serve my interests in
the hope I deign to serve yours.

189
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,370
原谅我。我会照你说的做。

189
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,370
Forgive me. I'll
do what you ask.

190
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,350
和图密善在一起的那个人是谁

190
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,350
Who was that man with Domitian?

191
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,186
他叫Tenax

191
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,186
His name is Tenax.

192
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:29,188
他来自郊区。还是个罪犯

192
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:29,188
He's from the
Suburra. And a criminal.

193
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,423
我需要更多地了解他。

193
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,423
I need to know more about him.

194
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,738
快来救我！快来救我！

194
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,738
Come for me! Come for me!

195
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,406
还有其他人吗卢修斯

195
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,406
Is there anyone else, Lucius?

196
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:25,144
号我什么都告诉你了我发誓

196
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:25,144
No. I told you
everything. I swear.

197
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
来吧，

197
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Come on,

198
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,663
不会崩溃

198
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,663
isn't going to break.

199
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,765
再用力点。

199
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,765
Give it to him harder.

200
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,605
一些非常令人担忧的事情。

200
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,605
Something that
is of great concern.

201
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,557
兄弟，我希望你能和猶太女王一起忙碌

201
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,557
Brother, I expect you to be
busy with the Queen of Jews

202
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,692
晚上的這個時候。

202
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,692
this time of night.

203
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,828
小心點你走的冰沒有那麼厚。

203
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,828
Careful now. The ice
you walk on is not so thick.

204
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,833
有一個人，據說是最近糧食暴動的領導者，盧修斯。

204
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,833
There's a man, said to have
led the recent food riots, Lucius.

205
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,734
- 你知道他嗎？- 號

205
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,734
- Do you know of him?
- No.

206
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,404
嗯，有人說他是你的雇員。

206
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,404
Well, some say
he's of your employ.

207
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,407
有人說提圖斯養猴子和狗。

207
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,407
Some say Titus beds
monkeys and dogs.

208
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,609
這是真的嗎

208
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,609
Does that make it true?

209
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,249
我不認識他，陛下。

209
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,249
I do not know him, My Emperor.

210
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,684
那你就不會在乎盧修斯的死了

210
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,684
Then you will not care
that this Lucius is dead.

211
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,488
先被打，

211
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,488
Beaten first,

212
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,856
也許是為了獲取信息

212
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,856
perhaps for information.

213
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,026
或許是為了消遣。

213
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,026
Perhaps for pleasure.

214
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,260
和盧修斯在一起的人也死了

214
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,260
Men seen with
Lucius are dead also.

215
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,797
奧斯蒂亞的港務長

215
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,797
The Harbor Master at Ostia,

216
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,400
都是運糧的。

216
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,400
all were involved
in grain delivery.

217
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,634
就像他們在掩蓋自己的蹤跡。

217
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,634
As if they were
covering their tracks.

218
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,471
兄弟看著我的眼睛

218
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,471
Brother, look me in the eye.

219
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,511
你是不是為了讓我難堪而推遲了糧食的運送？

219
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,511
Did you delay the grain
delivery to embarrass me?

220
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,650
你覺得我會讓父親難堪嗎

220
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,650
You think I would
embarrass Father?

221
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,752
我讓黑幫找弗拉維安人的血，只是為了讓你難堪？

221
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,752
That I'd have the mob call for Flavian
blood, simply to embarrass you?

222
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,826
- 是嗎？- 號

222
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,826
- Did you?
- No.

223
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,461
我弟弟被關在他的房間裡。

223
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,461
My brother is to be
confined to his chambers.

224
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,772
- 沒有我的允許，他不會離開的。- 但是哥哥...

224
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,772
- He will not leave without my permission.
- But brother...

225
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:27,701
在我找到事情的真相之前，他會一直待在這裡。

225
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:27,701
And he shall remain, until I've
found the truth of the matter.

226
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,835
離開我

226
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,835
Leave me.

227
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,788
你相信他嗎？

227
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,788
Do you believe him?

228
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,156
我還不能決定

228
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,156
I can't yet decide.

229
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,692
暴亂對他來說也是一個風險。

229
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,692
The riot would have
been a risk for him also.

230
00:19:56,996 --> 00:20:01,433
還有艦隊的船長，但他們在海上。

230
00:19:56,996 --> 00:20:01,433
There are still the fleet
captains, but they are at sea.

231
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,740
一旦他們登陸，把他們帶到我面前。

231
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,740
Once they make landfall,
bring them before me.

232
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,153
- 你沒事吧？- 勉強

232
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,153
- Are you all right?
- Barely.

233
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,288
我差點就死了。

233
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,288
I just came close to death.

234
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,959
你認為貝雷妮絲是在給他建議嗎？

234
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,959
Do you think Berenice
is advising him?

235
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,329
當然了她知道我對她和她的人民的憤怒。

235
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,329
Of course. She knows my
ire towards her and her people.

236
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,534
殺了多少人，羅馬的五千個兒子？

236
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,534
Killers of how many, five
thousand sons of Rome?

237
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,336
為什麼不讓Tenax照顧她？

237
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,336
Why not have
Tenax attend to her?

238
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,673
煽動我哥哥對情人的報復？

238
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,673
And incite a lover's
vengeance in my brother?

239
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,076
並不是所有的猶太人

239
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,076
Not all the Judeans
are comfortable

240
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,380
讓他們的女王為你弟弟張開雙腿

240
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,380
with the idea of their queen
spreading her legs for your brother.

241
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,483
你怎麼知道的

241
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,483
And how would you know that?

242
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,186
我在工地有眼線。

242
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,186
I have ears at the
construction site.

243
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,756
有傳言說他們在秘密會面，

243
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,756
There are rumors
of meetings in secret,

244
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,393
斯巴達人起義的可能性正在討論中

244
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,393
where the possibility of a
Spartacan revolt is being discussed...

245
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,095
他們的一個長輩，

245
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,095
One of their elders,

246
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:07,666
據說建築師亞撒利雅稱她為提圖斯的妓女。

246
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:07,666
the architect, Azariah, has been
heard to call her Titus's whore.

247
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,372
幹得好

247
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,372
Well done.

248
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:13,939
你看，

248
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:13,939
See,

249
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,511
我可不只是個混蛋和一張嘴。

249
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,511
I am more than an
ass and a mouth.

250
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,383
我們要離間他們，

250
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,383
We'll drive a wedge
between them,

251
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,585
我哥哥

251
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,585
my brother

252
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,619
和他的妓女

252
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,619
and his whore.

253
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,691
出去！

253
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,691
Out!

254
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,016
我要和我女兒談談，

254
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,016
I need to speak
with my daughter,

255
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,683
求你了

255
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,683
please.

256
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,525
母親

256
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,525
Mother.

257
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,695
- 我不能久留。- 我知道我知道

257
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,695
- I cannot stay long.
- I know, I know.

258
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,669
你對他們的女兒了解多少？女祭司？

258
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,669
What do you know about
their daughter? The priestess?

259
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,671
我從沒聽說過有女兒。

259
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,671
I have never heard
about a daughter.

260
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,972
他們有個兒子。

260
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,972
They have a son.

261
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,642
他們經常談論他。

261
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,642
They often speak about him.

262
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,577
朱利葉斯為什麼？為什麼？

262
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,577
Julius. Why?

263
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,814
德魯斯利亞呢

263
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,814
And Drusilla?

264
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,550
你注意到她外出有什麼規律嗎？

264
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,550
Have you noticed any
routines in her outings?

265
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:35,255
有一次，她在日落的時候帶著一些微不足道的東西出去了。

265
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:35,255
One time, she went out at
sundown with some paltry goods.

266
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,090
好.看著她，告訴我.

266
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,090
Good. Watch her and let me know.

267
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,491
嗯？

267
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,491
Hmm?

268
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,594
茱拉

268
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,594
Jula!

269
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,763
走了走了

269
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,763
Go now. Go.

270
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,944
御車者天蠍座執政官

270
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,944
The charioteer, Scorpus, Consul.

271
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,779
天蠍座！

271
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,779
Ah, Scorpus!

272
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,817
什麼風把您吹來了？

272
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,817
To what do I owe
the honor of this visit?

273
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:08,922
我覺得我們的合作關係太重要了不能結束。

273
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:08,922
I've decided that our
partnership is too valuable to end.

274
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:13,692
天蠍座願意出個好價錢，

274
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:13,692
Scorpus is willing,
for the right price,

275
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,564
是的，凱旋迴到藍派。

275
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,564
yes, to return triumphantly
to the Blue Faction.

276
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,767
你真是太慷慨了，天蠍座。

276
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,767
That's very generous
of you, Scorpus.

277
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,902
但是氙氣呢？我們僱用了他來代替你。

277
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,902
But what of Xenon? We've
hired him in your stead.

278
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:27,539
氙氣是，呃......你知道，他是個好司機，我承認，

278
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:27,539
Xenon is, uh... You know,
he's a good driver, I admit,

279
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,175
但他不是天蠍座。

279
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,175
but he is no Scorpus.

280
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,845
他比天蝎座更忠诚。

280
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,845
He's more loyal than Scorpus.

281
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,949
也许我欠你一个道歉。

281
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,949
Perhaps I owe you an apology.

282
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:39,719
为？

282
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:39,719
For?

283
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,589
- 呃，为了...... - 他妈的老婆？

283
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,589
- Uh, for...
- Fucking his wife?

284
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,595
一句话，是的。

284
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,595
In a word, yes.

285
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,135
我可以为我们两个人说话吗，我的爱人？

285
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,135
May I speak for the
two of us, my love?

286
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,738
当然，我们是一体的。

286
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,738
Of course, we speak as one.

287
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:00,839
总是。

287
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:00,839
Always.

288
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,809
我们支付给 Xenon 的费用是我们付给您的三倍。

288
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,809
We're paying Xenon three
times what we paid you.

289
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,685
即使你出现，我们也不会雇用你

289
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,685
We wouldn't hire you
back even if you showed up

290
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,888
嘴里满是珍珠和印度红宝石

290
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,888
with your mouth full of
pearls and an Indian ruby

291
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:19,358
从你屁股上掉下来的鸡蛋的大小。

291
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:19,358
the size of a hen's egg
falling out of your ass.

292
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:24,163
去他妈的吧。

292
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:24,163
Go fuck yourselves.

293
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:27,200
该死的罗马人。

293
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:27,200
Fucking Romans.

294
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,301
我很乐意操我的丈夫。

294
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,301
I'd happily fuck my husband.

295
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:36,108
任何人，只要不是你。

295
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:36,108
Anyone, as long as it's not you.

296
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,049
就这样。

296
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,049
Right this way.

297
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,086
你继续让我惊叹。

297
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,086
You continue to amaze me.

298
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,688
謝謝。

298
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,688
Thank you.

299
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:02,134
呸。

299
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:02,134
Ugh.

300
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:27,993
我警告过你父亲，禁止你嫁给那个男人。

300
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:27,993
I warned your father to forbid
you from marrying that man.

301
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,065
Caltonia.

301
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,065
Caltonia.

302
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:37,537
我好慚愧

302
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:37,537
I'm so ashamed.

303
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,904
你家人知道嗎？

303
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,904
Does your family know?

304
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,844
自從我母親去世後，我的叔叔們就拋棄了我們。

304
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,844
Since my mother's death,
my uncles have abandoned us.

305
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,981
父親開始喝酒了

305
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,981
Father's turned to wine,

306
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:50,950
我們的莊園也消失了。

306
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:50,950
and our estates are gone.

307
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,255
我只有藍派的股份

307
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,255
All I had were those
shares in the Blue Faction.

308
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:57,123
我和我的擁護者談過了。

308
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:57,123
I've spoken to my advocates.

309
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,960
那些股份被你丈夫偷走了

309
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,960
Those shares were
stolen by your husband.

310
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,096
你要離開這裡，

310
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,096
You will leave this place,

311
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,164
住在我家

311
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,164
live under my roof,

312
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:08,701
我們將一起進入法庭，奪回屬於你的東西。

312
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:08,701
and together, we will enter the
courts and get back what is yours.

313
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,236
你願意為我這麼做？

313
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,236
You would do that for me?

314
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,339
我愛你孩子

314
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,339
I love you, child.

315
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,876
我們會把他們找回來的。

315
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,876
We will get them back.

316
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:25,018
我會出高價從你手裡買下他們

316
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:25,018
And I will buy them from
you at an exorbitant price.

317
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,886
然後你和我我們會慶祝我們的...

317
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,886
And then you and I,
we will celebrate our...

318
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,023
我們的合作關係。

318
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,023
Our partnership.

319
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,528
早上好，蘭圖勒斯。

319
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,528
Morning, Lentullus.

320
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,963
周末前我需要兩輛戰車

320
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,963
I need two chariots
by the week's end.

321
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,366
- 不，這不可能。- 沒有什麼是不可能的

321
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,366
- No, that's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

322
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,170
- 這些呢？- 哦

322
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,170
- What about these?
- Oh.

323
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,940
一年前，

323
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,940
Well, a year ago,

324
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,241
我用最輕的木頭做實驗，

324
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,241
I experimented with
the lightest of woods,

325
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:52,311
並剃掉支柱，讓它們和我的手指一樣薄。

325
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:52,311
and shaved the struts, made
them as thin as my finger.

326
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,115
他們很快，很快，

326
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,115
They were fast, so fast,

327
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,884
但太輕了無法通過重量限制

327
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,884
but too light to get past
the weight restrictions.

328
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,854
他們能在周末前準備好嗎？

328
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,854
Can they be ready by
the end of the week?

329
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,288
是的，但你永遠無法讓他們通過檢查。

329
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,288
Yes, but you'll never
get them past inspection.

330
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,826
那是我的問題

330
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,826
Let that be my problem.

331
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:11,530
哦，還有，呃，金色的油漆，

331
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:11,530
Oh, and the, uh, golden paint,

332
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,333
減少它的光澤。更有品位。

332
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,333
give it less shine.
More tasteful.

333
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,938
感謝大家的到來。

333
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,938
Thank you all for coming.

334
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,776
我們一起做，就像你們羅馬人一樣。

334
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,776
We do this all together,
just like you Romans.

335
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,377
- 是嗎-是的效率更高。

335
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,377
Yes? Much more efficient.

336
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:30,049
是啊，大家都知道你能為我們開車是我們的福氣。

336
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:30,049
Yes, well, it's no secret that we'd all
be fortunate to have you driving for us.

337
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,419
你很貴也不是什麼秘密。

337
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,419
And it's no secret
that you're expensive.

338
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,020
這是自然

338
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,020
That goes without saying.

339
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:38,892
是的，好吧，失去了氙，顯然，我感興趣。

339
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:38,892
Yes, well, having lost
Xenon, clearly, I'm interested.

340
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,361
- 你需要什麽？- 簡單.

340
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,361
- What do you need?
- Simple.

341
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:45,298
如果天蠍座想在馬戲團昂首挺胸

341
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:45,298
If Scorpus is to hold his
head high in the Circus,

342
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,667
他的報酬肯定比氙高

342
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,667
he must be paid more than Xenon.

343
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:51,337
一百零八？不，對我來說太富有了。

343
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:51,337
A million eight? No,
too rich for my blood.

344
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:53,940
我不玩了

344
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:53,940
I'm out.

345
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,009
祝你們好運

345
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,009
Good luck to you all.

346
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:57,277
來吧孩子們

346
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:57,277
Come, boys.

347
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,780
我也退出。

347
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,780
And I'm out, too.

348
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,982
不，不，等等。號

348
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,982
No, no, wait. No.

349
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,118
你不能把我留給一個投標人。

349
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,118
You can't leave
me with one bidder.

350
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:08,755
- 我可以為你贏。- 我不想贏。

350
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:08,755
- I can win for you.
- I don't want to win.

351
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:12,291
- 你當然知道- 我贏不起。

351
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:12,291
- Of course you do.
- I can't afford to win.

352
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:14,027
我靠聰明賺錢。

352
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:14,027
I profit by being smart.

353
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,895
我降低了成本，讓我的競爭對手

353
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,895
I cut my costs down
and let my competitors

354
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:20,099
用金子感謝我幫他們贏了

354
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:20,099
thank me with gold
for helping them win.

355
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,167
祝你好運

355
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,167
Good luck.

356
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,009
所以，我們在這裡。

356
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,009
So, here we are.

357
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,244
一百零八。

357
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,244
A million eight.

358
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:35,815
不，109萬，因為氙是支付108萬。

358
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:35,815
No, a million nine, because
Xenon is being paid a million eight.

359
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,417
嗯.我沒看到其他人出價。

359
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,417
Hmm. I don't see
anyone else bidding here.

360
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:45,090
它會增加你的尊嚴...

360
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:45,090
It will add to your dignitas...

361
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,961
給我的錢比瑪蘇斯給氙的多

361
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,961
to pay me more than
Marsus is paying Xenon.

362
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,462
是的我有足夠的尊嚴。

362
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,462
Yes. Well, I have
sufficient dignitas.

363
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,897
謝謝你天蠍座

363
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,897
Thank you, Scorpus.

364
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,201
六十萬。

364
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,201
Six hundred thousand.

365
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:04,943
這樣的開場白傷害了我的感情。

365
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:04,943
Such an opening
offer hurts my feelings.

366
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,445
這不是開場白

366
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,445
Not an opening offer.

367
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:08,547
這是我最後一次了

367
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:08,547
It's my final one.

368
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,651
我是天蠍座。

368
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,651
I am Scorpus.

369
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,920
是的，我付錢。

369
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,920
Yes, and I'm paying.

370
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:21,227
聽著，如果能安撫你的情緒，我們可以，呃，

370
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:21,227
Look, if it will soothe your
feelings, we can always, uh,

371
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,328
告訴全世界是一百零九

371
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,328
tell the world it
was a million nine.

372
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,269
好孩子

372
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,269
Good boy.

373
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,115
天蠍座？

373
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,115
Scorpus?

374
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,252
現在不行

374
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,252
Not now.

375
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,156
但你想慶祝。

375
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,156
But you wanted to celebrate.

376
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:12,979
嗯，確保他得到一些關注。

376
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:12,979
Hmm, make sure that
he gets some attention.

377
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,248
他剛和白人簽約了。

377
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,248
He just signed with the Whites.

378
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,128
哦親愛的

378
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,128
Oh, dear.

379
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,531
我記得它更大。

379
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,531
I remember it being bigger.

380
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,901
更堅定。

380
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,901
And firmer.

381
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,671
我們都變老了，我想。沒辦法

381
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,671
We all get older, I
suppose. No way around it.

382
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,138
誰讓你進來的

382
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,138
Who let you in?

383
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,377
我見到了市政官盧迪。

383
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,377
I met with the Aedile Ludi.

384
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:49,382
好消息他很快就會恢復我們的黃金陣營。

384
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:49,382
Good news. He'll soon be
reinstating our Gold Faction.

385
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,852
訂購了新的裝備，是馬戲團有史以來最輕的。

385
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,852
New rigs ordered, the lightest
the Circus has ever seen.

386
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,355
你會像風一樣飛起來的，我的朋友。

386
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,355
You'll be flying like
the wind, my friend.

387
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:59,025
很快不是現在。

387
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:59,025
Soon is not now.

388
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,760
我剛簽了懷特一家的合同。

388
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,760
I have just signed
for the Whites.

389
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,496
你這個忘恩負義的小混蛋。

389
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,496
You ungrateful little bastard.

390
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:06,465
我把你從你媽的皮條客手裡救了出來。

390
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:06,465
I pulled you from the
clutches of your mother's pimp.

391
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:07,967
為此，我感謝你。

391
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:07,967
For that, I thank you.

392
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:13,239
你，前三場勝利都來自我的修復。

392
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:13,239
You, whose first three
wins were all from my fixes.

393
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:17,576
是的，是的，是的。你做了很多，但我也是。

393
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:17,576
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
You did a lot, but so did I.

394
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,182
你是對的

394
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,182
You're right.

395
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,452
我的脾氣控制了我。

395
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,452
My temper overtook me.

396
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:30,423
或許我們應該各走各的路。

396
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:30,423
Perhaps we should
go our separate ways.

397
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,161
睡一覺吧

397
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,161
Get some sleep.

398
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,564
當你和我的西班牙人比賽的時候你會需要它的。

398
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,564
You'll need it when you
drive against my Spaniards.

399
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,236
它們讓我想起了你，

399
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,236
They remind me of you,

400
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:45,238
你知道，當你在你的黃金時期。

400
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:45,238
you know, when you
were in your prime.

401
00:31:45,872 --> 00:31:47,339
尤其是那個安德里亞。

401
00:31:45,872 --> 00:31:47,339
Especially that Andria.

402
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,310
是啊，我看到有一天你的身體

402
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,310
Yeah, I see a day when your body

403
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,579
正在馬戲團的脊柱里腐爛

403
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,579
is rotting in the
spina of the Circus,

404
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,150
他讓整個羅馬都忘了你的存在

404
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,150
and he's making all of
Rome forget you ever existed.

405
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:08,094
祝你和白人好運

405
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:08,094
Good luck with the Whites.

406
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:20,606
然後我們會帶來50個布里甘廷侏儒。

406
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:20,606
And then we are bringing
in 50 Brigantine midgets.

407
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:23,343
讓他們和同樣數量的鬥牛犬競爭。

407
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:23,343
And pit them against an
equal number of bull-hounds.

408
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:28,080
我是說，還有什麼更好的方式來榮譽提圖斯·弗拉維烏斯的崛起嗎？

408
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:28,080
I mean, is there any finer way
to honor Titus Flavius' ascent?

409
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:30,450
矮人與狗，

409
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:30,450
Dwarfs versus dogs,

410
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:32,503
你就這點能耐嗎

410
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:32,503
is that the best you can do?

411
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,392
號我是說，你有沒有...你看到那些狗了嗎？

411
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,392
No. I mean, have you...
Have you seen the dogs?

412
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,557
來吧來吧你還有什麼？

412
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,557
Come, come. What
else do you have?

413
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,459
哦

413
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,459
Oh.

414
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:44,396
盧杜斯·比斯特烏斯收到了一批有趣的紅屁股猴子

414
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:44,396
Ludus Beastius has received an
interesting number of red-assed monkeys,

415
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:49,234
它們都是雄性，我們可以建造一個外殼，

415
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:49,234
and they're all males, and
we could build an encasement,

416
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:52,705
一片森林在野外，柵欄不太高。

416
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:52,705
a forest in the wild,
fence not too high.

417
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:56,343
因為雌性不應該逃跑...

417
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:56,343
Because the females
should not escape...

418
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:58,978
我是說，雌性不應該逃跑。

418
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:58,978
I mean, the females
should not escape.

419
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,598
你不是說他們都是男性嗎。

419
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,598
I thought you said
they were all males.

420
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,148
我說的不是母猴子。

420
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,148
I'm not talking about
monkey females.

421
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,285
我說的是人類女性。

421
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,285
I'm talking about human females.

422
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:10,522
是的，因為他們想操一切會動的東西。

422
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:10,522
Yes, because they would like
to fuck everything that moves.

423
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:12,991
我覺得那不合我哥哥的口味。

423
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:12,991
I don't think that's
to my brother's taste.

424
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:15,761
聽我說完

424
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:15,761
Well, just hear me out.

425
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:20,400
有一個大結局。

425
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:20,400
There is a grande finale.

426
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:23,403
大自然的奇蹟。

426
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:23,403
An absolute wonder of nature.

427
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:27,574
幽靈巨獅。

427
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:27,574
The Gigantic Ghost Lion.

428
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,412
從頭到尾都是白色，

428
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,412
White from head to tail,

429
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,881
比維蘇威上空的雲層還要蒼白。

429
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,881
paler than the
clouds over Vesuvius.

430
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,787
這惡獸必從陰間上來，把他們都吞吃了。

430
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,787
This fierce beast will arise
from Hades, and devour them all.

431
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,888
你真是個變態，帕蘇斯。

431
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,888
You're a sick man, Passus.

432
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:44,790
嗯.好吧...

432
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:44,790
Hmm. Well...

433
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:46,358
而是一頭白色獅子。有趣.

433
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:46,358
But a white lion. Interesting.

434
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,394
我想親眼看看。

434
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,394
I wish to see it myself.

435
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,230
我得先逃出自己的牢籠。

435
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,230
I have to escape
my own cage first.

436
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,699
午夜在訓練場見。

436
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,699
Meet me at the Ludus
Beastius at midnight.

437
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:53,798
走了

437
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:53,798
Go.

438
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,269
走了

438
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,269
Go now.

439
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,073
門

439
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,073
Door.

440
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,311
我要去小便。

440
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,311
I need to urinate.

441
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,458
圖密善

441
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,458
Domitian.

442
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,561
我希望你沒有承諾太多。它在哪裡？

442
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,561
I hope you didn't over
promise. Where is it?

443
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:55,695
就在這裡

443
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:55,695
Right over here.

444
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:21,253
你真漂亮。

444
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:21,253
How beautiful you are.

445
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,623
如此美麗，如此致命。

445
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,623
So very beautiful,
so very deadly.

446
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,760
我知道該怎麼利用你。

446
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,760
I know exactly how I'll use you.

447
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:30,963
你將是我的兄弟...

447
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:30,963
You'll be my brother...

448
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,670
提圖斯·弗拉維烏斯，羅馬的皇帝

448
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,670
Titus Flavius, Emperor of Rome,

449
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:42,708
耶路撒冷的征服者。

449
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:42,708
Conqueror of Jerusalem.

450
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:46,079
我想讓這隻野獸成為我們偉大的提圖斯·弗拉維亞努斯的象徵。

450
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:46,079
I want this beast to be a symbol
of our glorious Titus Flavianus.

451
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:49,048
- 當然了- 一隻嗜血成性的野獸。

451
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:49,048
- Of course.
- A beast with an unquenchable thirst for blood.

452
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:54,219
讓你的建築師重建一個耶路撒冷的複製品，適合馬戲團。

452
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:54,219
Have your builders reconstruct a
replica of Jerusalem, fit for the Circus.

453
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,523
我們要慶祝那座城市被攻陷！

453
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,523
We shall celebrate
the sacking of that city!

454
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,824
請允許我問一下

454
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,824
Allow me to ask.

455
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:02,027
白色獅子會攻擊誰？

455
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:02,027
Who will the white lion attack?

456
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:03,396
你一定要這麼遲鈍嗎？

456
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:03,396
Do you have to be so dim?

457
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,032
- 不。-你認為誰住在耶路撒冷？

457
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,032
- No.
- Who do you think lives in Jerusalem?

458
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:07,567
- 高盧人？- 啊啊

458
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:07,567
- Gauls?
- Uh-uh.

459
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:09,768
猶太人

459
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:09,768
Judeans.

460
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:10,936
猶太人

460
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:10,936
Judeans.

461
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,413
一隻貓，即使是這麼兇猛的一隻，

461
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,413
A cat, even one
as fierce as this,

462
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,048
被人群的景象和聲音嚇到了

462
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,048
are terrified by the sight
and sounds of the crowd.

463
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,751
如果沒有訓練，它會凍結。

463
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,751
Without training,
it will freeze.

464
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,554
你想破壞圖密善的幻象嗎？

464
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,554
Would you like to
spoil Domitian's vision?

465
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:30,590
你想激起他的憤怒嗎？

465
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:30,590
Would you like to
excite his anger?

466
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:31,956
號

466
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:31,956
No.

467
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,047
曼尼留斯，

467
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,047
Manilius,

468
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,585
我的希臘男孩看到你在馬戲團賭博。

468
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,585
my Greek boy has seen
you betting at the Circus.

469
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,025
你以為脫下軍裝就能掩蓋你的所作所為嗎？

469
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,025
You think removing your military
garb is sufficient to hide what you do?

470
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:07,860
你的賭注，你的債務，

470
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:07,860
Your betting, your debts,

471
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,498
你從禁衛軍的薪津單上

471
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,498
your skimming from
the Praetorian payroll

472
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:13,766
讓你處於危險之中

472
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:13,766
to pay those debts
has put you at risk.

473
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,471
冒著生命危險，但不要害怕，

473
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,471
Mortal risk, but never fear,

474
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:20,739
我需要你的服務，

474
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:20,739
I have need of your service,

475
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:25,878
會有豐厚的獎勵

475
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:25,878
for which there will be
a substantial reward.

476
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:38,023
猶太人密謀殺害他們的王后，我哥哥的王后。

476
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:38,023
There's a plot amongst Judeans to
kill their queen, my brother's consort.

477
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:41,894
其中一個建築師，亞撒利雅，似乎是這個陰謀的領導者。

477
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:41,894
One of the architects, Azariah,
appears to be the leader of this plot.

478
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:47,500
我要你去逮捕幾個反叛的猶太人

478
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:47,500
I need you to arrest
some rebellious Judeans.

479
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,269
- 出去！出去！出去！- 這是什麼意思？

479
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,269
- Out! Out!
- What is the meaning of this?

480
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,172
- 你們都出去- 滾出去！

480
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,172
- All of you, out!
- Get out of here!

481
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,239
你為什麼要這麼做？

481
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,239
Why are you doing this?

482
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:24,704
你想幹什麼？

482
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:24,704
What do you want?

483
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:28,074
我們為什麼被捕？

483
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:28,074
Why are we arrested?

484
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:32,045
我被指控煽動叛亂並密謀殺害你們的女王。

484
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:32,045
I was told for sedition and
plotting to kill your Queen.

485
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,947
- 你說什麼？兩個都是謊言。

485
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,947
What? Lies, both of them.

486
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:36,449
我不在乎。

486
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:36,449
It doesn't matter to me.

487
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:39,085
明天你會死。你們所有人

487
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:39,085
Tomorrow you
will die. All of you.

488
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,920
被獅子殺死。

488
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,920
Killed by a lion.

489
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:51,864
這隻獅子很可能不會攻擊

489
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:51,864
This particular lion
will likely not attack

490
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:55,034
除非有人向野獸發起衝鋒。

490
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:55,034
unless somebody
charges the beast.

491
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,036
這就是你進來的地方。

491
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,036
That's where you come in.

492
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,840
我為什麼要拋棄我的生活

492
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,840
And why should I
throw my life away

493
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,077
為了方便你

493
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,077
for your convenience?

494
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,416
如果你這樣做，我會問帕蘇斯，遊戲大師，

494
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,416
If you do, I'll ask Passus,
the Master of Games,

495
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,985
放過你的女人和孩子

495
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,985
to spare your
women and children.

496
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,485
上帝保佑

496
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,485
By the Gods.

497
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:48,487
我討厭被關在這裡。

497
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:48,487
I hate being held
a prisoner here.

498
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,423
提圖斯皇帝萬歲

498
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,423
Hail Emperor Titus.

499
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:10,143
我真希望我能看到

499
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:10,143
I so wish I could see

500
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:13,980
羅馬人對猶太人的仇恨

500
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:13,980
the venom the Roman people
have for the Judeans, up close.

501
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,016
來了

501
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,016
Come.

502
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,990
她不是我們的女王！

502
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,990
She's not our queen!

503
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:32,998
可恥！

503
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:32,998
Shame!

504
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:40,407
已經是提圖斯盔甲上的裂縫了。

504
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:40,407
Already a chink
in Titus's armor.

505
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:44,510
回來

505
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:44,510
Come back.

506
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,813
我哥哥總是讓我吃驚。

506
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,813
My brother never
ceases to amaze me.

507
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:49,081
他怎麼能讓白麗萊茜坐在他旁邊？

507
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:49,081
How can he allow
Berenice to sit next to him?

508
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:51,583
他怎麼會沒想到呢？

508
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:51,583
How could he have
not seen this coming?

509
00:40:51,684 --> 00:40:53,519
- 為了羅馬的榮耀. - 來了

509
00:40:51,684 --> 00:40:53,519
- For the glory of Rome...
- Come.

510
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,856
為征服耶路撒冷而榮譽！

510
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,856
And to honor the
conquest of Jerusalem!

511
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:01,427
這是什麼？

511
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:01,427
What is this?

512
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:05,030
你說這次慶典是為了慶祝你登基。

512
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:05,030
You said this pageant was to
celebrate your accession to the throne.

513
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:18,478
隨著城市的燃燒，

513
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:18,478
As the city burns,

514
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:22,014
看看野蠻的猶太人，

514
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:22,014
behold the barbaric Judeans,

515
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,454
由他們的猶太女王貝麗萊茜領導

515
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,454
led by Berenice,
their Judean Queen.

516
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:41,967
現在，野蠻的猶太人

516
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:41,967
And now, the barbaric Judeans

517
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:46,106
將面對羅馬無與倫比的力量

517
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:46,106
will face the unparalleled
might of Rome.

518
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:52,012
他是非常強大的泰特斯·弗拉維亞努斯。

518
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:52,012
It is the very powerful
Titus Flavianus.

519
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,344
現在！

519
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,344
Now!

520
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:08,561
開門！

520
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:08,561
Open the gate!

521
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:45,164
看在上帝的份上，或者你的上帝，做點什麼吧！

521
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:45,164
For the sake of my God,
or your Gods, do something!

522
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,201
他們是我的人

522
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,201
These are my people.

523
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:49,969
做

523
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:49,969
Do it.

524
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,972
做

524
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,972
Do it.

525
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,074
動手吧

525
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,074
Do it!

526
00:42:57,476 --> 00:42:58,677
動手吧

526
00:42:57,476 --> 00:42:58,677
Do it!

527
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,065
結束這一切

527
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,065
End this!

528
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:30,309
結束這一切！

528
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:30,309
End this now!

529
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,052
你認為他見過我嗎？

529
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,052
Do you think he's seen me?

530
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:42,422
是的

530
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:42,422
Yes.

531
00:43:44,423 --> 00:43:45,423
是的

531
00:43:44,423 --> 00:43:45,423
He has.

532
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:58,938
這一次你做得太過分了

532
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:58,938
This time, you've gone too far.

533
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,280
在你殺了我之前聽我說完。

533
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,280
Hear me out before you kill me.

534
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,177
為這種厚顏無恥的行為編造理由？

534
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,177
Weave a justification
for such effrontery?

535
00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:07,347
是的，你害怕聽到嗎？

535
00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:07,347
Yes, are you too
afraid to hear it?

536
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:10,481
你得快點說。

536
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:10,481
You must speak quickly.

537
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,152
好好說話！

537
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,152
Speak well!

538
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:15,288
否則這把劍會刺穿你的心臟。

538
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:15,288
Or this sword will be struck
right through your heart.

539
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,824
我只是為你一石二鳥。

539
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,824
I merely killed two birds
with a single stone for you.

540
00:44:17,923 --> 00:44:23,128
那些死在競技場的人密謀殺害你寶貴的女王並取代她。

540
00:44:17,923 --> 00:44:23,128
Those who died in the arena were plotting to
kill your precious Queen and supplant her.

541
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,431
我救了她的命。

541
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,431
I saved her life.

542
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:28,001
讓暴民發泄他們對猶太人的仇恨。

542
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:28,001
And let the mob vent their
hatred for the Judeans.

543
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:30,235
你看，我從來沒聽說過這樣的陰謀。

543
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:30,235
You see, I've heard
nothing of such a plot.

544
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:34,139
這是你的缺點

544
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:34,139
That is your failing,

545
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:37,811
不是我的

545
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:37,811
not mine.

546
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:40,112
我可以提供證人，

546
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:40,112
I can provide witnesses,

547
00:44:40,213 --> 00:44:42,782
- 和證據- 你看，證人，是可以收買的。

547
00:44:40,213 --> 00:44:42,782
- and proof.
- See, witnesses, they can be bought.

548
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:45,784
和證據，它可以被製作。

548
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:45,784
And proof, it can be crafted.

549
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:56,228
如果你這麼想我，

549
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:56,228
Well, if you think that of me,

550
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:59,365
那就用劍

550
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:59,365
then use your sword.

551
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:30,096
如果需要的話，

551
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:30,096
If I needed to,

552
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:32,766
我會的

552
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:32,766
I would.

553
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,748
- 你幹嘛這麼刺激他？- 我知道

553
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,748
- Why do you provoke him so much?
- I know.

554
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,184
我應該離那該死的陽台遠點。

554
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,184
I should've stayed away
from that damn balcony.

555
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:56,088
但這場演出太精彩了，不容錯過。

555
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:56,088
But it was just too
good of a show to miss.

556
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:25,751
我責怪自己讓你說服我加入你的帝國平台。

556
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:25,751
I blame myself for allowing you to talk me
into joining you on the Imperial platform.

557
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:30,556
為什麼？去看我被撕成碎片的醜劇？

557
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:30,556
For what? To watch a hideous
travesty of myself being torn apart?

558
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:34,561
- 我不知道這是計劃好的。- 你是皇帝。

558
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:34,561
- I didn't know that was planned.
- You are Emperor.

559
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:38,630
你應該知道的。

559
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:38,630
You should have known.

560
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:43,168
皇帝金庫里的金子都花在你不同意的遊戲上了

560
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:43,168
The gold of the Emperor's coffers
spent on games you did not approve,

561
00:46:44,103 --> 00:46:45,572
就在你眼皮底下

561
00:46:44,103 --> 00:46:45,572
under your very nose.

562
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:51,378
我聽說那些被殺的人都在密謀反對你。

562
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:51,378
I've been told that those that
were killed were plotting against you.

563
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:53,012
誰告訴你的

563
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:53,012
Told by whom?

564
00:46:53,112 --> 00:46:54,947
讓我猜猜你的毒蛇兄弟？

564
00:46:53,112 --> 00:46:54,947
Let me guess.
Your viper brother?

565
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:56,449
他說他有證據。

565
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:56,449
He says that he has proof.

566
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:58,952
他說了很多話，但有多少是真的？

566
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:58,952
He says many things, but
how many of them are true?

567
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,324
我不能讓你走

567
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,324
I can't let you leave.

568
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:07,126
如果你把我拖回去，我就自殺。

568
00:47:04,423 --> 00:47:07,126
If you have me dragged
back, I will take my own life.

569
00:47:07,226 --> 00:47:08,494
不你...

569
00:47:07,226 --> 00:47:08,494
No, you...

570
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:15,902
我求求你

570
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:15,902
I beg you.

571
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:18,471
請留下來

571
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:18,471
Please stay.

572
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:21,474
讓我來保護你

572
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:21,474
Let me protect you.

573
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:26,012
讓我證明給你看

573
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:26,012
Let me prove that to you.

574
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:30,682
但有一個條件

574
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:30,682
On one condition.

575
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:35,621
現在你讓我保護你。

575
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:35,621
Now you let me protect you.

576
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:40,326
他們永遠不會接受我做你的配偶。

576
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:40,326
They will never accept
me as your consort.

577
00:47:40,927 --> 00:47:43,096
羅馬人討厭外國女王。

577
00:47:40,927 --> 00:47:43,096
The Romans hate foreign queens.

578
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:45,076
他們必須學會接受你。

578
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:45,076
Then they will just have
to learn to accept you.

579
00:47:45,664 --> 00:47:46,666
埃及豔后？

579
00:47:45,664 --> 00:47:46,666
Cleopatra?

580
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:50,369
庫什的坎迪斯布狄卡？

580
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:50,369
Candace of Kush? Boudicca?

581
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:53,572
他們被接受了嗎？

581
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:53,572
Were they accepted?

582
00:47:53,672 --> 00:47:57,277
和外國女王在一起只會削弱你在他們眼中的地位

582
00:47:53,672 --> 00:47:57,277
To be with a foreign queen
only weakens you in their eyes.

583
00:47:58,711 --> 00:47:59,945
為了堅強，

583
00:47:58,711 --> 00:47:59,945
To be strong,

584
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:03,382
你必須反其道而行之

584
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:03,382
you must do the opposite.

585
00:48:05,585 --> 00:48:07,487
你必須娶一個羅馬妻子

585
00:48:05,585 --> 00:48:07,487
You must take a Roman wife

586
00:48:08,588 --> 00:48:12,291
一個有錢有勢的高貴家族

586
00:48:08,588 --> 00:48:12,291
of a good and august
family of wealth and power,

587
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:13,992
長久以來

587
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:13,992
of long standing.

588
00:48:16,128 --> 00:48:17,496
把我放在陰影里。

588
00:48:16,128 --> 00:48:17,496
Put me in the shadows.

589
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:21,634
這對你最好。

589
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:21,634
It is best for you.

590
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:27,974
你覺得什麼對你最好？

590
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:27,974
And what do you
think is best for you?

591
00:48:29,775 --> 00:48:33,980
我是一個被征服的女王。我應該躲在陰影里。

591
00:48:29,775 --> 00:48:33,980
I am a conquered queen.
My place is in the shadows.

592
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:06,311
你並不像你假裝的那樣無情。

592
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:06,311
You are not as
heartless as you pretend.

593
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:08,481
別那麼肯定

593
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:08,481
Don't be so sure.

594
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:11,583
孩子們都很尊敬你。

594
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:11,583
The children look up to you.

595
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:13,385
因為他們還是孩子。

595
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:13,385
That's because they're children.

596
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,487
他們崇拜任何人

596
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,487
They look up to anyone

597
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:18,391
他會給他們一些食物和硬幣。

597
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:18,391
who will give them a few scraps
of food and an occasional coin.

598
00:49:18,858 --> 00:49:19,958
是的

598
00:49:18,858 --> 00:49:19,958
I did.

599
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:34,507
你會說幾種語言？

599
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:34,507
How many languages do you speak?

600
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:37,577
不夠

600
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:37,577
Not enough.

601
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,746
你使用它們產生了很大的效果。

601
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,746
You use them to great effect.

602
00:49:40,746 --> 00:49:41,780
真的嗎？真的？

602
00:49:40,746 --> 00:49:41,780
Really?

603
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:43,682
你解除了人們的武裝。

603
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:43,682
You disarm people.

604
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:46,353
讓他們做你想做的事。

604
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:46,353
Get them to do what you want.

605
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:48,621
你就是這麼看的。

605
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:48,621
That's how you see it.

606
00:49:53,092 --> 00:49:54,594
日安

606
00:49:53,092 --> 00:49:54,594
Good day.

607
00:49:55,894 --> 00:49:58,465
- 你欠我的-某種程度上

607
00:49:55,894 --> 00:49:58,465
-Which you owe to
me -To some degree.

608
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:01,835
到那個程度，你會給我和我女兒更多的錢。

608
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:01,835
And to that degree, you will
pay me and my daughter more.

609
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:03,469
- 我會嗎？- 嗯嗯

609
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:03,469
- Will I?
- Mm-hmm.

610
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,773
奧拉的薪水漲了一半，我的漲了三倍。

610
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,773
Aura's salary up by
half, and mine tripled.

611
00:50:08,742 --> 00:50:09,742
你做得太過火了。

611
00:50:08,742 --> 00:50:09,742
You overreach.

612
00:50:10,744 --> 00:50:12,045
好吧

612
00:50:10,744 --> 00:50:12,045
Fine.

613
00:50:12,144 --> 00:50:14,414
我們會把你那老鼠出沒的地方

613
00:50:12,144 --> 00:50:14,414
We'll leave your
rat-infested insula

614
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:16,782
在另一家賭場找份工作

614
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:16,782
and find work at
another betting tavern.

615
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:31,063
我會把靈氣的增加四分之一你的增加一倍

615
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:31,063
I'll increase Aura's by a
quarter, and double yours.

616
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:35,300
像今天這樣繼續賺錢一個月，我們再談。

616
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:35,300
Keep bringing in the revenue like you did
today for a month, and we'll talk again.

617
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:36,902
太久了一周

617
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:36,902
That's too long. One week.

618
00:50:37,003 --> 00:50:38,438
- 兩個. - 同意了

618
00:50:37,003 --> 00:50:38,438
- Two.
- Agreed.

619
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:44,143
你在羅馬會過得很好的。

619
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:44,143
You'll do well in Rome.

620
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:47,514
我不是為這個來的。

620
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:47,514
I am not here for that.

621
00:50:47,614 --> 00:50:50,617
要花更多的錢才能讓朱莉重獲自由

621
00:50:47,614 --> 00:50:50,617
It will take a lot more
money to buy Jula's freedom.

622
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:54,521
而夸梅，一個角鬥士，可能是不可能的。

622
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:54,521
And Kwame, a gladiator,
probably impossible.

623
00:50:55,588 --> 00:50:57,123
我會想辦法的

623
00:50:55,588 --> 00:50:57,123
I will find a way.

624
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:10,963
求你了

624
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:10,963
Please.

625
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:13,900
請稍等

625
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:13,900
Please wait.

626
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:16,635
我有一個懇求。

626
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:16,635
I have an entreaty.

627
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:21,641
就像羅馬的其他人一樣。

627
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:21,641
As does every other
person in Rome.

628
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,643
我求你了我的孩子們被奪走了。

628
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,643
I beg of you. My children
have been taken from me.

629
00:52:26,945 --> 00:52:30,282
我的...我兒子是競技場的角鬥士，

629
00:52:26,945 --> 00:52:30,282
My... My son is a gladiator
at the Ludus Magnus,

630
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:32,786
還有我女兒

630
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:32,786
and my daughter,

631
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:34,454
她是個奴隸

631
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:34,454
she's a slave

632
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:36,588
在你父母的房子裡

632
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:36,588
in the house of your parents.

633
00:52:42,461 --> 00:52:44,931
我聽說你有能力

633
00:52:42,461 --> 00:52:44,931
I am told that you
have it in your power

634
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,601
釋放那些被判有罪的人和被囚禁的奴隸

634
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,601
to free those condemned
and those held as slaves.

635
00:52:50,302 --> 00:52:51,670
不是我是

635
00:52:50,302 --> 00:52:51,670
No, not me.

636
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:54,740
但我的護士長。

636
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:54,740
But my matron.

637
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:57,876
你能幫幫我嗎？

637
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:57,876
Could you help me?

638
00:52:59,978 --> 00:53:04,284
但願我母親也為她的女兒流眼淚，就像你為你的女兒流眼淚一樣。

638
00:52:59,978 --> 00:53:04,284
Would that my mother had had tears
for her daughter, as you do for yours.

639
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:11,724
我會和我的護士長說的

639
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:11,724
I will speak to my matron.

640
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,295
回到伊德斯，

640
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,295
Return on the Ides,

641
00:53:15,394 --> 00:53:17,864
到時候我會給你答覆的。去吧

641
00:53:15,394 --> 00:53:17,864
I will give you an
answer by then. Now, go.

642
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:03,742
昆圖斯

642
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:03,742
Quintus.

643
00:54:05,844 --> 00:54:07,079
好久不見

643
00:54:05,844 --> 00:54:07,079
It's been a while.

644
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,083
把手放在我能看到的地方。

644
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,083
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

645
00:54:10,182 --> 00:54:12,418
不然我就把你的脊椎從根上切斷。

645
00:54:10,182 --> 00:54:12,418
Or I'll sever your
spine at the root.

646
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
熊？

646
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
Ursus?

647
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,896
你留下燒死的那個男孩。

647
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,896
The boy you left to burn.

648
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:28,168
是我承擔了後果。

648
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:28,168
It was me who suffered
the consequences.

649
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:29,436
我以為你死了

649
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:29,436
I thought you were dead.

650
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:31,771
更糟！

650
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:31,771
Worse!

651
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:38,244
我被賣去當奴隸。無盡的地獄歲月。

651
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:38,244
I was sold as a galley
slave. Endless years in hell.

652
00:54:38,344 --> 00:54:41,481
幸運的是，我應徵加入了羅馬軍隊

652
00:54:38,344 --> 00:54:41,481
Luckily, I was drafted
into the Roman Army,

653
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:43,449
並為之奮鬥多年

653
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:43,449
and fought for them for years.

654
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,684
找到你很容易。

654
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,684
It was easy to find you.

655
00:54:45,784 --> 00:54:49,755
在沒完沒了地說要去羅馬之後

655
00:54:45,784 --> 00:54:49,755
After all the endless
talk about going to Rome

656
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:54,059
在著名的馬克西姆斯馬戲團工作

656
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:54,059
and work in the
famous Circus Maximus.

657
00:55:00,032 --> 00:55:03,702
你知道奴隸殺死主人的懲罰

657
00:55:00,032 --> 00:55:03,702
You know the punishment
for a slave killing his master

658
00:55:04,336 --> 00:55:06,706
就是釘十字架

658
00:55:04,336 --> 00:55:06,706
is crucifixion.

659
00:55:07,306 --> 00:55:09,074
但對你來說太快了。

659
00:55:07,306 --> 00:55:09,074
But that's too quick for you.

660
00:56:06,932 --> 00:56:09,202
我要用你的尿淹死你！

660
00:56:06,932 --> 00:56:09,202
I'm gonna drown
you in your own piss!

661
00:56:38,797 --> 00:56:41,034
我不會殺你的

661
00:56:38,797 --> 00:56:41,034
I'm not gonna kill you.

662
00:56:41,134 --> 00:56:44,170
我要把你所有的錢都榨出來。

662
00:56:41,134 --> 00:56:44,170
I'm gonna squeeze all
the money out of you.

663
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:46,773
我要奪走你的一切。

663
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:46,773
I'm gonna take
everything from you.

664
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:54,914
我不會讓你得逞的！

664
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:54,914
I'm not going to let
you get away with this!
