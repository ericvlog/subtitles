1
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:07,573
前情提要

1
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:07,573
Previously on
Those About to Die...

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:12,144
这就是奴隶不接受命运的下场

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:12,144
That's what happens to slaves
when they don't accept their fate.

3
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:14,647
新买的奴隶，会被带到哪里去？

3
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:14,647
Newly bought slaves,
where would they be taken?

4
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:17,283
你需要钱。

4
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:17,283
You need money.

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,585
- 很多钱。- 你在玩一个危险的游戏。

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,585
- Lots of money.
- You play a dangerous game here.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,021
你觉得天蝎座会离开我们去别的阵营吗

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,021
Do you think Scorpus is
leaving us for another faction?

7
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:23,690
他在策划什么事。

7
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:23,690
He's up to something.

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,024
这个是处女

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,024
This one is a virgin.

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,660
- 三千塞斯特斯。- 妈妈！

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,660
- Three thousand sesterces.
- Mother!

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,062
五百

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,062
Five hundred.

11
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,133
你想利用这个女儿作为中间人来监视你的敌人。

11
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,133
You seek to use this daughter as a
go-between to spy on your enemy.

12
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:35,067
我来当你的中间人。

12
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:35,067
I will be your go between.

13
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,537
提图斯你将成为皇帝

13
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,537
Titus, you will be Emperor.

14
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,723
维苏威火山的黄色火山灰

14
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,723
The trick with the yellow
ash of Mount Vesuvius

15
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,491
并没有使用太多。

15
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:59,491
is not using too much.

16
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:02,728
太多了，治愈比诅咒更糟糕。

16
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:02,728
Too much, and the cure
is worse than a curse.

17
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:03,996
多少才算太多？

17
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:03,996
How much is too much?

18
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,364
这就是艺术

18
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,364
That's the art of it.

19
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:31,591
众神就在里面。

19
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:31,591
The Gods reside within.

20
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,259
他们住在哪里？

20
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,259
Where do they stay there?

21
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:48,441
你应该改变你中间两匹马的位置。

21
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:48,441
You should change the positions
of your middle two horses.

22
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:51,811
你的大马在左中锋，

22
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:51,811
You have your big
horse left center,

23
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,513
他应该在中间

23
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,513
and he should be right center.

24
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,747
我做得很好。

24
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,747
I've done all right.

25
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,284
当然，我...说说而已

25
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,284
Of course, I'm... just saying.

26
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,855
你开车吗，安德里亚？

26
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,855
Do you drive, Andria?

27
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,391
两匹马大部分。

27
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,391
Two horse gigs mostly.

28
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,858
但我开过四辆，

28
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,858
But I've driven fours,

29
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,560
我曾经开过一辆六号车

29
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,560
and I once drove a six.

30
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,496
人印象深刻.

30
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,496
Impressive.

31
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,698
我知道我还有很多要学。

31
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,698
I know I have a lot to learn.

32
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:13,766
我是个乡下人，

32
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:13,766
I'm a provincial boy,

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,969
就像你曾经一样

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,969
just as you once were.

34
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,507
但你学会了，我也会。

34
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,507
But you learned, so will I.

35
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:23,409
有一天我也会在马克西姆斯马戏团开车

35
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:23,409
And, one day, I, too, will
drive in Circus Maximus,

36
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:25,311
喜欢你你

36
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:25,311
like you.

37
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:28,615
没人能像我一样开车。

37
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:28,615
Nobody drives like me.

38
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,584
我们回罗马吧。

38
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,584
Let's get back to Rome.

39
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:41,661
埃利亚，斑点的那个刚死了

39
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:41,661
Elia, the mottled one just died.

40
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,735
伦诺和费罗克斯一样的母马和公马，年轻一个赛季。

40
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,735
Lenno. The same mare and
sire as Ferox, a season younger.

41
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,742
他从来没有像Ferox那么快，但他有一颗多么好的心。

41
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,742
He was never as fast as
Ferox, but what a heart he had.

42
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,580
他会一直跑直到爆炸。

42
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,580
He would have
run until it exploded.

43
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,350
跟我说说这个叫Tenax的人

43
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,350
Tell me of this man Tenax.

44
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,220
比某些人好，比某些人差。

44
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,220
Better than some,
worse than others.

45
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,557
他在马克西姆斯马戏团做生意赌博。

45
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,557
He does business
betting at Circus Maximus.

46
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:56,228
买，卖，做我看不见的事。

46
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:56,228
Buying, selling, doing
things I don't see.

47
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,865
我不会说的，即使我看到他们。

47
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,865
I would not speak
of, even if saw I them.

48
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,507
带她去马苏斯领事馆，确保她能联系上她女儿.

48
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,507
Get her to the House of Consul Marsus,
and make sure she contacts her daughter.

49
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,543
我需要玛索斯和安东尼娅的消息。

49
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,543
I need ears on
Marsus and Antonia.

50
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,788
求你了

50
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,788
Please.

51
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,759
稍等求你了

51
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,759
One moment. Please.

52
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,516
你完好无损吗？

52
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,516
Are you intact?

53
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,394
靠近一点

53
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,394
Come closer.

54
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,704
好.德鲁斯利亚会教你该学的东西

54
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,704
Good. Drusilla here will train
you in what you need to know.

55
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,877
说话

55
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,877
Speak.

56
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:54,480
你不能从一次触摸中知道她的童贞。

56
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:54,480
You could not know her
virginity from a single touch.

57
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,816
不是我的触摸证实了这一点。

57
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,816
It wasn't my touch
that confirmed it.

58
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,685
是她的眼泪。

58
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,685
It was her tears.

59
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,964
- 德鲁斯利亚- 克劳迪娅

59
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,964
- Drusilla.
- Claudia.

60
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,000
这是你们家新来的女孩的母亲。

60
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,000
This is the mother of
the new girl in your house.

61
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,649
去厨房

61
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,649
Go, to the kitchen.

62
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:41,826
茱拉

62
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:41,826
Jula.

63
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,165
你怎么会在这里？我们该怎么办？

63
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,165
How can you be here?
What are we to do?

64
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,000
安静点

64
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,000
Quiet.

65
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,235
我们时间不多了

65
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,235
We don't have much time.

66
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,637
有些事你得去做

66
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,637
There are things you need to do.

67
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,709
仔细听好了。

67
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,709
Now listen carefully.

68
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,980
我儿子也在罗马，

68
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,980
My son is in Rome as well,

69
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,781
被认为是角斗士

69
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,781
taken to be a gladiator.

70
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,750
他会在哪里？

70
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,750
Where would he be?

71
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,721
竞技场。来了

71
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,721
The Ludus Magnus. Come.

72
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,127
这太疯狂了

72
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,127
This is madness.

73
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,694
我不会参与的

73
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,694
I will have no part of this.

74
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:19,132
- 去吧- - 你说什么？

74
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:19,132
- Go then.
- What?

75
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,637
等等他说这会害死他们。

75
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,637
Wait. He said it
could kill them.

76
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,906
我们还能做什么

76
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,906
I mean, what else can we do?

77
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,011
在马厩里放乌鸦，铃铛吓跑鬼魂？

77
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,011
Put crows in their stalls,
bells to scare away the spirits?

78
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,544
加夫罗斯？

78
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,544
Gavros?

79
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:35,581
如果我们什么都不做，他们会死的。

79
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:35,581
They'll die, if we do nothing.

80
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,084
有了这个，或许他们还有机会。

80
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,084
With this, perhaps
they have a chance.

81
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,821
让我来吧

81
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,821
Let me do it.

82
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:54,167
放松放松放松轻轻是的

82
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:54,167
Easy, easy, easy,
easy. Gently. Yes.

83
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,847
号我早料到了。

83
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,847
No. I saw that coming.

84
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,716
用网

84
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,716
Use the net.

85
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,119
在我落网之前别想三叉戟了。

85
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,119
Forget the trident
until I'm snared.

86
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,456
号

86
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,456
No.

87
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:19,625
你得骗我。

87
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:19,625
You have to trick me.

88
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,661
人比动物聪明。

88
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,661
Men are smarter than animals.

89
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:32,138
现在你学乖了

89
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:32,138
Now you're learning.

90
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,841
反面.进攻方防守

90
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,841
Reverse. Attackers, defend.

91
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,917
好.

91
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,917
Good.

92
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,923
走！走！

92
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,923
Move! Move!

93
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:50,789
把我搞糊涂了。

93
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:50,789
Confuse me.

94
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:54,094
如果我动一下，你就知道了。你会知道的。

94
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:54,094
If I move, you will
learn. You will know.

95
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,865
如果我还活着，你就得猜。

95
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,865
If I'm still, you have to guess.

96
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,908
水

96
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,908
Water.

97
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,052
是谁教你打猎的？

97
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,052
Who taught you the
hunting of animals?

98
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,889
动物？

98
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,889
Animals?

99
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,760
当我还是个孩子的时候，

99
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,760
When I was a boy,

100
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,928
我父亲会笑着说

100
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,928
my father would
say that and laugh.

101
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,134
“向猎物学习，而不是向我学习。"

101
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,134
"Learn from the
prey, not from me."

102
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,970
但我都是跟他学的。

102
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,970
But I learn it all from him.

103
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,740
他来自努比亚，

103
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,740
He was from Nubia,

104
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,442
黑法老的土地

104
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,442
the land of the Black Pharaohs,

105
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:47,480
从远古时代起我们就和国王一起打猎

105
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:47,480
where we have hunted with
kings, since the dawn of time.

106
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:53,086
当我会爬的时候，他教我抓老鼠和鼹鼠。

106
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:53,086
When I could crawl, he taught
me to catch mice and moles.

107
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:57,823
当我还能走路的时候，到处都是蜥蜴、野兔和狐狸。

107
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:57,823
When I could walk, it was
lizards and hares and foxes.

108
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,961
当我可以和他一起跑的时候，我们把所有有价值的猎物都带走了。

108
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,961
When I could run alongside
him, we took all the worthy prey.

109
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,732
他怎么死的？

109
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,732
How did he die?

110
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,005
罗马人杀了他。

110
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,005
Romans killed him.

111
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,106
为什么？为什么？

111
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,106
Why?

112
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,143
因为他们是罗马人。

112
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,143
Because they are Romans.

113
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:23,216
这就是他们所说的四帝之年。

113
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:23,216
It was what they called the
Year of The Four Emperors.

114
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,583
罗马人打罗马人

114
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,583
Romans fighting Romans.

115
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,620
我父亲为错误的罗马人而战。

115
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,620
My father fought for
the wrong Roman.

116
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,856
维斯帕先赢了，他向失败者复仇。

116
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,856
Vespasian won and took his
vengeance against the losers.

117
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,129
第一个罗马人是双胞胎。

117
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,129
The first of the
Romans were twins.

118
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,265
罗穆卢斯和雷穆斯被母亲抛弃，任其自生自灭。

118
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,265
Romulus and Remus, abandoned
by their mother, left to die.

119
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,703
一只母狼发现了它们，给它们喂奶，并把它们养大为狼

119
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,703
A she-wolf found them, suckled
them and raised them as wolves

120
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:47,106
在帕拉蒂尼山上的一个山洞里

120
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:47,106
in a cave on a
hill called Palatine.

121
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,311
维斯帕先和他的儿子们的宫殿就在那里。

121
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,311
Where the palace of Vespasian
and his sons now stands.

122
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:57,350
狗，即使是像拉科尼亚人和狐狸这样的野蛮人，也只在饥饿的时候才杀人。

122
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:57,350
Dogs, even savage ones like Laconians
and vulpines only kill when hungry.

123
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,886
甚至土狼。

123
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,886
Even hyenas.

124
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,890
它们是很讨厌的生物，它们只在饥饿的时候杀人。

124
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,890
The nasty creatures they
are, they only kill when hungry.

125
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:09,293
狼是不同的。

125
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:09,293
Wolfs are different.

126
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,099
狼以杀人为乐。

126
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,099
Wolves kill for pleasure.

127
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,068
就像罗马人一样。

127
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,068
Like the Romans.

128
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,039
那你呢

128
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,039
And what of you?

129
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,640
从战场上带走的？

129
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,640
Taken from a battlefield?

130
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,980
不，在城垛上，我们的女人和孩子在我们后面。

130
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,980
No, on a battlement, with our
women and children behind us.

131
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,519
在北方，有耻辱和投降。

131
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,519
In the north, there is
shame and surrender.

132
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,923
但这是让我们的家人活下去的唯一办法。

132
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,923
But it was the only way
to keep our families alive.

133
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,259
我妻子和儿子都在罗马。

133
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,259
My wife and son
are here in Rome.

134
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:43,062
从第一个小时到第十二个小时，她为他们编织。

134
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:43,062
From the first to the 12th
hour, she weaves for them.

135
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,799
我儿子七岁了。

135
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,799
My son is seven.

136
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,005
他花了两年时间在地毯上，

136
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,005
He has spent the last
two years hooking a rug,

137
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,342
有钱的罗马人会踩在上面

137
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,342
that will be walked on by
the feet of rich Romans.

138
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:05,818
我可以在Kalends上看到他们，有时，每个月的Nones。

138
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:05,818
I get to see them on the Kalends and,
sometimes, the Nones of each month.

139
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,927
所以你梦想得到木剑。

139
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,927
And so you dream of
gaining the Wooden Sword.

140
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,798
也许有一天

140
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,798
Maybe one day.

141
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,302
科隆，弗拉玛，过来。

141
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,302
Colon, Flamma, come here.

142
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,744
科隆，两天后你将在马克西姆斯竞技场和弗拉玛决斗

142
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,744
Colon, you will fight Flamma
in two days in Circus Maximus

143
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,412
在战车比赛之前

143
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,412
before the chariot races.

144
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,413
维果，

144
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,413
Viggo,

145
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,716
你和夸梅是科隆的武器兵

145
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,716
you and Kwame will be
Colon's weapons men.

146
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,919
一定要把他的尸体卖个好价钱。

146
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,919
Make sure you get a
good price for his body.

147
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,951
有办法进去吗？

147
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,951
Is there a way to enter?

148
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:16,556
容易.做一个肌肉发达，有男子气概的奴隶，随时准备为罗马的荣耀而被屠杀。

148
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:16,556
Easy. Be a well-muscled, manly slave ready
to be butchered for the glory of Rome.

149
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,990
走开

149
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,990
Be off.

150
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,192
你不是罗马人。

150
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,192
You are not Roman.

151
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,327
你是叙利亚人

151
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,327
You're Syrian.

152
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,710
求你了

152
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,710
Please.

153
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,282
我儿子在里面。

153
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,282
My son is in there.

154
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,192
嘿，等等！

154
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,192
Hey, wait!

155
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,163
夸梅

155
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,163
Kwame!

156
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:38,871
朱拉和奥拉呢？

156
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:38,871
What of Jula and Aura?

157
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,750
朱拉是马苏斯领事家的奴隶

157
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,750
Jula is a slave in the
house of Consul Marsus,

158
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:44,443
而奥拉的主人是一个叫特奈克斯的罪犯

158
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:44,443
and Aura, she is owned by a
criminal, a man called Tenax.

159
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,145
他们还好吗？

159
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,145
Are they well?

160
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,679
他们还活着

160
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,679
They're alive.

161
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,586
- 小心- 别生气。

161
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,586
- Watch out.
- Hold your anger.

162
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,687
别再惹麻烦了

162
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,687
Don't make more trouble.

163
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,822
我会把你从这里救出来。

163
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,822
I'll free you from here.

164
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,323
- 我不这么认为. - 我会的我保证

164
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,323
- I don't believe so.
- I will. I promise.

165
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,424
你得走了

165
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,424
You must go.

166
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,296
你在干什麽？你说什么？

166
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,296
What are you doing? Huh?

167
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,041
你为什么这么恨你哥哥？

167
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,041
Why do you hate
your brother so much?

168
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,411
我不知道我爱你是因为你的愚蠢还是因为你的愚蠢。

168
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,411
I don't know whether I love you in
spite of your stupidity or because of it.

169
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,114
这不是个愚蠢的问题

169
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,114
It's not a stupid question.

170
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,881
为什么要当皇帝？

170
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,881
Why aspire to be Emperor?

171
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,985
没有它，你仍然可以拥有曾经可能想要的一切。

171
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,985
Without it, you can still have
everything once could possibly want.

172
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,355
我对泰特斯是个威胁。

172
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,355
I am a danger to Titus.

173
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:32,158
所以他才说服我父亲不让我当军事指挥官。

173
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:32,158
That's why he convinced my
father to deny me military command.

174
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,827
所以我才被管得这么紧，

174
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,827
It's why I've been kept
on such a tight leash,

175
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,830
乞求足够的钱来生活，

175
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,830
begging for enough
money to live,

176
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,932
即使在哄骗了参议院之后，

176
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,932
even after cajoling the Senate,

177
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,866
争取他们支持我父亲的事业

177
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,866
winning them over
to my father's cause,

178
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,534
给了他一把教长椅

178
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,534
giving him the curule chair.

179
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:44,702
我变成什么了？

179
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:44,702
I've been made what?

180
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,474
Aedile Ludi？

180
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,474
Aedile Ludi?

181
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,677
- 地方官卢迪是一个受人尊敬的职位。- 我是一个表演者。

181
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,677
- Aedile Ludi is a position of respect.
- I'm a showman.

182
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,749
我的哥哥，军人，是受人尊敬的。

182
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,749
My brother, the
soldier, is respected.

183
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,251
当我还是个孩子的时候，他折磨我。

183
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,251
When I was a boy,
he tormented me.

184
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,422
这使他觉得好笑。

184
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,422
It amused him.

185
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,625
他会在他的士兵朋友面前打我让我哭。

185
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,625
He'd strike me in front of his
soldier friends and make me cry.

186
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,260
训练场上，

186
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,260
On the training field,

187
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,642
他会给我一把剑，激我向他进攻

187
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,642
he would put a sword in my
hand and dare me to attack him.

188
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,432
但当我这样做的时候，他会一次又一次地打我。

188
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,432
But when I did, he would
strike me again and again.

189
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,702
笑

189
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,702
Laughing.

190
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,673
- 在他们面前羞辱我。- 他很年轻。

190
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,673
- Humiliating me before all of them.
- He was young.

191
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,772
他太残忍了！

191
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,772
He was cruel!

192
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,382
最终，这种折磨变成了宽容。

192
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,382
Eventually, that torment
turned to tolerance.

193
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,586
但当我父亲去世时，这种宽容就会变成恐惧。

193
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,586
But when my father dies,
that tolerance will become fear.

194
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,755
他会杀了我

194
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,755
And he will kill me.

195
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,292
除非我已经解决了你

195
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,292
And unless I've
disposed of you already,

196
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,395
他会把你和我一起沿着

196
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,395
he'll kill you along with me.

197
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,768
如果我没有野心，我就死了。

197
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,768
If I'm not ambitious, I'm dead.

198
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:07,885
不好意思

198
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:07,885
I'm sorry.

199
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,770
我想现在没有理由留下来了。

199
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,770
No reason to stay
now, I suppose.

200
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,701
埃利亚

200
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,701
Elia!

201
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:57,736
来了

201
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:57,736
Come.

202
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,973
快点.快点.快点.

202
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,973
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

203
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,642
快点，快点。

203
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,642
Quickly, quickly.

204
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,583
费洛斯费罗克斯

204
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,583
Ferox. Ferox!

205
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,319
好孩子

205
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,319
Good boy.

206
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,547
非洲人

206
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,547
African.

207
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:45,651
我需要工作。

207
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:45,651
I need work.

208
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,586
还有工资

208
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,586
And a wage.

209
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,326
我在马克西姆斯马戏团有个赌酒屋。

209
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,326
I have a betting tavern
at the Circus Maximus.

210
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,327
你们两个可以在那里工作。

210
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,327
You two could work there.

211
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:56,996
付钱？

211
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:56,996
Pay?

212
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,897
- 我们走着瞧- 马！

212
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,897
- We'll see about that.
- The horses!

213
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:11,943
死而复生。

213
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:11,943
Back from the dead.

214
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,781
我欠海王星一个牺牲。

214
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,781
I owe Neptune a sacrifice.

215
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,151
- 他们很弱。- 但越来越强壮。

215
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,151
- They are weak.
- But getting stronger.

216
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,220
有多强？我们明天比赛。

216
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,220
How much stronger?
We race tomorrow.

217
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,255
比我们买的马还强壮。

217
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,255
Stronger than the
nags we bought.

218
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,223
你给我找了第二个司机吗

218
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,223
Did you find me a second driver?

219
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,125
没有人像你和我一样愚蠢。

219
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,125
No one else is as
foolish as you and I.

220
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,527
没人想把拇指

220
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,527
No one wants to
shove their thumb

221
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,462
从传统的角度来看，并加入第五个派系。

221
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,462
in the eye of tradition
and join a fifth faction.

222
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,868
- 两匹马？- 四个。

222
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,868
- Two horse gigs?
- And fours.

223
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:42,909
你被录取了

223
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:42,909
You're in.

224
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,932
来了

224
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,932
Come.

225
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,715
装了不会更容易的。

225
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,715
Pretend. It won't go easier.

226
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,861
我有没有告诉过你我对你这个丈夫的评价有多高？

226
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,861
Have I ever told you how highly
I think of you as a husband?

227
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,529
不，我不记得了。你有过这样的想法吗？

227
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,529
No, not that I can remember.
Have you ever had such a thought?

228
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,531
比你想象的还要多。

228
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,531
More times than you might think.

229
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,670
天蝎座告诉我们他要永远离开蓝军

229
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,670
So Scorpus told us he's
leaving the Blues for good.

230
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,605
- 嗯. - 但他根本不知道是我

230
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,605
- Hmm.
- But he didn't even know it was me

231
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,708
下令毒死他的马

231
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,708
who ordered his horses poisoned.

232
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,310
- - 你说什么？那是你吗？- 当然了

232
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,310
- What? That was you?
- Of course.

233
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,713
你重新获得我们派系的控制权，我来保护它。

233
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,713
You regain controlling interest
of our faction, and I protect it.

234
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,849
我突然想起来我为什么嫁给你了。

234
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,849
I suddenly remember
why I married you.

235
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,919
- 我为什么要用这种... - 尊重？

235
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,919
- To what do I owe this expression of...
- Respect?

236
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,154
- 爱呢？- 爱也是。

236
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,154
- And love?
- Love as well.

237
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:03,589
嗯嗯

237
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:03,589
Mm-hmm.

238
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:11,564
天蝎座是个好司机，不会让他开卡车来对付我们的。

238
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:11,564
Scorpus is too good a driver to
let him take the truck against us.

239
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,768
你介意我安排他的死吗

239
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,768
Do you mind if I
arrange his death?

240
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,970
不我没有

240
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,970
No, I don't.

241
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,005
来了

241
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,005
Come.

242
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,147
这是什么？

242
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,147
What's this?

243
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:29,382
礼物

243
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:29,382
A gift.

244
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:33,686
她完好无损。

244
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:33,686
She's intact.

245
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,632
这是你以前用的香水

245
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,632
It's the same scent
you used to wear.

246
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,590
我以为你会喜欢的。

246
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,590
I thought you might enjoy that.

247
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,736
走了走！

247
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,736
Go. Go!

248
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,734
他在哪里？

248
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,734
Where is he?

249
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,105
茱拉来了

249
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,105
Jula's here.

250
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,874
来了

250
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,874
Come.

251
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,743
有人看见你离开吗？

251
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,743
Did anyone see you leave?

252
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,778
号好.你有什么要给我的？

252
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,778
No. Good. What
do you have for me?

253
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,713
- 他们说要杀人- 是谁？

253
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,713
- They said they're gonna kill someone.
- Who?

254
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,083
- 可能是带S的东西。- 天蝎座？

254
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,083
- It could be something with an S.
- Scorpus?

255
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,184
是的天蝎座

255
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,184
Yes. Scorpus.

256
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,155
把她带回来，确保没人看见她。

256
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,155
Get her back, make
sure no one sees her.

257
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,794
噢，茱拉。

257
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,794
Oh, Jula.

258
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,096
你好吗？他们对你好吗？

258
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,096
How are you? Do
they treat you well?

259
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,198
我很好。

259
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,198
I'm fine.

260
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,233
来了快

260
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,233
Come. Quickly.

261
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:19,025
我想看看跑道是什么样的。

261
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:19,025
I wanted to see what
the running surface is like.

262
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,828
是的，他们在转弯时换了粗粒沙子。

262
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,828
Yeah, they switched the
coarser grain sand on the turns.

263
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,131
我们得向左急拉才能守住防线。

263
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,131
We have to pull hard
left to hold the line.

264
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:31,037
人们认为我是个有天赋的酒鬼傻瓜

264
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:31,037
People think I'm a
gifted, drunken fool.

265
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:36,241
我赢是因为福图纳在我母亲子宫里摸过我。

265
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:36,241
That I win because Fortuna
touched me in my mother's womb.

266
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:41,213
我妈妈是个妓女。福图纳从来没来看过我们。

266
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:41,213
My mother was a whore.
Fortuna never came to visit us.

267
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,848
我赢了，因为，和你一样，

267
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,848
I win, because, like you,

268
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:47,019
在比赛的前一天晚上，我来到椭圆球场测试沙子。

268
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:47,019
the night before a race, I come
to the oval and I test the sand.

269
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,175
明天，我就死了。

269
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,175
Tomorrow, I die.

270
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,277
是的

270
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,277
Yes.

271
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,915
弗拉玛杀死高卢人时

271
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,915
When Flamma killed the Gauls,

272
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,553
我帮忙把它们剩下的东西搬到动物围栏里。

272
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:20,553
I helped carry what was left
of them to the animal pens.

273
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,556
没人来取他们的尸体

273
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,556
No one came for their bodies,

274
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:27,027
阿提克斯的肉卖了20塞斯特斯

274
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:27,027
and Atticus got 20
sesterces for the meat.

275
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:33,432
我是个战士，战士的儿子，

275
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:33,432
I'm a warrior, son of a warrior,

276
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,969
最后一个辛布里人

276
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,969
the last of the Cimbri people.

277
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,772
我可不想最后变成老虎屎。

277
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,772
And I do not wish to end
up as shit from a tiger.

278
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,476
我希望像我父亲和祖父那样结束，

278
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,476
I wish to end as my
father and grandfather did,

279
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:48,314
就像从战士的柴堆上升起的烟雾，升到星星上。

279
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:48,314
as smoke rising from a warrior's
pyre, ascending to the stars.

280
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:52,317
我来负责你的火葬。

280
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:52,317
I will see to your pyre.

281
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,252
谢谢

281
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,252
Thank you.

282
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,794
我也不想最后变成老虎屎。

282
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,794
I don't wanna end up
as shit from a tiger either.

283
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:04,396
如果我还活着，我会看着办的。

283
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:04,396
If I'm still alive,
I'll see to it.

284
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:05,597
那你呢

284
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:05,597
What of you?

285
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,299
谁来照顾你的柴堆？

285
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,299
Who will attend to your pyre?

286
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,071
我喜欢老虎。

286
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,071
I like tigers.

287
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:16,142
我不介意最后变成老虎屎。

287
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:16,142
I wouldn't mind ending
up as shit from a tiger.

288
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,817
- 天蝎座。- 女士们

288
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,817
- Scorpus.
- Ladies.

289
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:29,855
- 你说什么？

289
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:29,855
What?

290
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,625
你说什么？

290
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,625
Huh?

291
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,897
你说什么？

291
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,897
Huh?

292
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:40,633
他们在干什么？

292
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:40,633
What are they doing?

293
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,002
- 是天蝎座！- 是天蝎座！

293
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,002
- It's Scorpus!
- It's Scorpus!

294
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,053
他们在攻击天蝎座

294
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,053
They're attacking Scorpus.

295
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,296
出去

295
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,296
Out.

296
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:17,470
你在嘲笑我。

296
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:17,470
You astonish me.

297
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,672
你在说什么啊？

297
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,672
What are you talking about?

298
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:21,106
整个罗马都知道，天蝎座死了。

298
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:21,106
All of Rome knows,
Scorpus is dead.

299
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:24,176
一场毫无线索的街头犯罪。

299
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:24,176
A street crime with
no hint of who did it.

300
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,612
干得好

300
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,612
Well done.

301
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,146
不是我

301
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,146
It wasn't me.

302
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:29,749
- - 你说什么？- 我想一大早就杀了他，

302
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:29,749
- What?
- I wanted to kill him in the early morning,

303
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,718
所以没时间找人替代他

303
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,718
so there will be no
time to replace him.

304
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,787
哦，好吧，那对我们更好。

304
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,787
Oh, well, all the better for us.

305
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,020
我们是清白的。

305
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,020
Our hands are clean.

306
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,398
另外，新派系的马

306
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,398
Add to that, that the
new faction's horses

307
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,791
几乎跑不动还被无名小卒驾驶

307
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,791
can barely run and they're
being driven by nobodies.

308
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:40,026
一对西班牙新郎。

308
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:40,026
A pair of Spanish grooms.

309
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,362
有一件事我们要处理。

309
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,362
There's one thing we
need to take care of.

310
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,198
我们需要一个新司机。

310
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,198
We need a new driver.

311
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,398
你有什么想法吗

311
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,398
Do you have any thoughts?

312
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:49,268
我知道

312
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:49,268
I do.

313
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,217
我们是来清点帝国账目的

313
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,217
We are here to tally
the Imperial Accounts.

314
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:10,723
一些光。

314
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:10,723
Some light.

315
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,259
也许一些隐私？

315
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,259
Maybe some privacy?

316
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,438
你们每一个人五个这个

316
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,438
Each of you. Five of these.

317
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,010
为什么要搞阴谋？它是你的了

317
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,010
Why the intrigue? It's yours.

318
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:33,511
好吧...

318
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:33,511
Well...

319
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,781
在某种意义上。

319
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,781
in a sense.

320
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,759
站住

320
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,759
Halt.

321
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,402
卢修斯

321
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,402
Lucius.

322
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,305
分散赌注。每人不超过一万塞斯特斯。

322
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,305
Spread the bets. No more
than 10,000 sesterces each.

323
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:01,740
一切都会失去。

323
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:01,740
All to lose.

324
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,345
殿下，恕我直言，这说不通

324
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,345
Your Highness, with
respect, that makes no sense.

325
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,346
你不可能赢所有人。

325
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,346
You can't win betting
against everyone.

326
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,480
照我说的做

326
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,480
Do as I say.

327
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,684
所有这些，悄悄下注，

327
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,684
All of this, quiet bets,

328
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:15,055
绿色、红色、蓝色和白色将输。

328
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:15,055
that Green, Red, Blue
and White shall lose.

329
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:19,325
我觉得胜算很大。

329
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:19,325
I expect excellent odds.

330
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,428
爱马仕。

330
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,428
Hermes.

331
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,813
我的王后

331
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,813
My Queen.

332
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,084
你给我带来了什么，金匠？

332
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,084
What have you
brought me, Goldsmith?

333
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,385
帝国国库的标志。

333
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,385
The mark of the
Imperial Treasury.

334
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:49,588
我们为图密善重铸了40根金条。

334
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:49,588
We've recast 40
gold bars for Domitian.

335
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,111
向你唯一的，孤独的上帝祈祷？

335
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,111
Praying to your one, lonely God?

336
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:14,413
- 是的- 你问他要什么？

336
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:14,413
- Yes.
- What do you ask him for?

337
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,249
原谅

337
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,249
Forgiveness.

338
00:30:18,518 --> 00:30:21,086
有些事情只有上帝才能原谅。

338
00:30:18,518 --> 00:30:21,086
There are some things
only God can forgive.

339
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,555
说说看

339
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,555
Try me.

340
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,654
我为我的家人祈祷

340
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,654
I pray for my family.

341
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,892
家庭是危险的。

341
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,892
Families are dangerous.

342
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,496
他们能比你在马戏团的退休人员更彻底地诱捕你。

342
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,496
They can ensnare you more completely
than your retiarius in the Circus.

343
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,999
哦，你是说我的家人。

343
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,999
Oh, so you mean my family.

344
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:37,302
图密善是个男孩，而我是个战士。

344
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:37,302
Well, Domitian is a
boy, and I am a soldier.

345
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,538
你以为你的剑能保护你吗

345
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,538
You think your
sword will protect you?

346
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,808
是的，还有禁卫军。

346
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,808
That and those of the
Praetorian Guards, yes.

347
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,480
我的祖父，大希律王，总是说，

347
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,480
My grandfather, Herod
the Great, always said,

348
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,152
“用剑杀死蝎子可不容易。"

348
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,152
"It is not easy to kill a
scorpion with a sword."

349
00:30:56,455 --> 00:31:00,426
你弟弟的野心越来越大了。

349
00:30:56,455 --> 00:31:00,426
Your brother grows
more open in his ambition.

350
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,101
这是什么？

350
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,101
What's this?

351
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:11,304
看起来是一根有皇家印章的金条

351
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:11,304
Appears to be a gold bar
with an Imperial Stamp.

352
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:14,173
- 你从哪弄来的？- 不，问题是，你从哪弄来的？

352
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:14,173
- Where did you get it?
- No, the question is, where did you get it?

353
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:17,576
- 不是我有，是你。- 别耍我！

353
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:17,576
- Well, I'm not the one who has it, you are.
- Do not toy with me!

354
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,614
你从帝国金库里拿的

354
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,614
You took it from the
Imperial Treasury.

355
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:22,781
我没做过这种事。

355
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:22,781
I did no such thing.

356
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,750
不管是谁告诉你的，他们都在撒谎。

356
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,750
And whoever told
you I did, they're lying.

357
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:26,920
他们为什么要这么做？

357
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:26,920
Why would they do that?

358
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,457
离间我们对很多人都有好处。

358
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,457
There are many who would benefit
from driving a wedge between us.

359
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,135
如果你愿意，我会去查的。

359
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,135
If you wish, I'll look into it.

360
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,461
我已经这么做了。

360
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,461
I've already done so.

361
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,298
我已经下令对财政部进行会计核算。

361
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,298
I've ordered an
accounting of the Treasury.

362
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,467
原谅我，但那是我的领域。

362
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,467
Well, forgive me,
but that is my domain.

363
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,336
不会太久的

363
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,336
Not for long.

364
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:55,280
他会杀了你

364
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:55,280
He will kill you.

365
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,619
他可能会。

365
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,619
He may.

366
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,588
你打算怎么办？

366
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,588
What are you going to do?

367
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:09,996
财政部很大，清点库存需要时间。

367
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:09,996
The Treasury is large,
an inventory will take time.

368
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:15,934
今天我赢了，我会把借的钱还回去，把我的金库填满。

368
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:15,934
When I win today, I'll return
what I borrowed and fill my coffers.

369
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,636
希望足够买几个禁卫军。

369
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,636
Hopefully enough to
buy some Praetorians.

370
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,242
- 他们很贵的，禁卫军。- 如果你没赢呢？

370
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,242
- They're expensive, Praetorians.
- And if you don't win?

371
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:28,248
我想我会死的。

371
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:28,248
Then I expect I'll die.

372
00:32:30,517 --> 00:32:32,285
你可以和我一起死

372
00:32:30,517 --> 00:32:32,285
You can die with me.

373
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,093
你疯了吗？我不能为布鲁开车

373
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,093
Are you mad? I
can't drive for Blue.

374
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,326
白色让我富有。

374
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,326
White has made me rich.

375
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,962
再说，雷托会杀了我的。

375
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,962
And besides, Leto would kill me.

376
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,397
他可以试试。

376
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,397
He may try.

377
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,468
我们会保护你的

377
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,468
We will protect you.

378
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,505
雷托现在付你多少钱？

378
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,505
How much does Leto pay you now?

379
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,442
罗马都知道。

379
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,442
All Rome knows.

380
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:59,244
每个赛季600，000塞斯特斯，相当于您向天蝎座支付的费用。

380
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:59,244
600,000 sesterces a season,
equal to what you pay Scorpus.

381
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:01,448
- 我们会把它翻三倍。- 安东尼娅...

381
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:01,448
- We will triple that.
- Antonia...

382
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,019
一季一百六十万？

382
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,019
1,600,000 a season?

383
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:11,691
我想是一季180万。

383
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:11,691
I believe it's
1,800,000 a season.

384
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:16,128
就现在，今天，今天的比赛？

384
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:16,128
Right now, today,
for today's race?

385
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:17,997
现在，否则免谈。

385
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:17,997
Right now, or no deal.

386
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,766
我要开英西塔图斯。

386
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,766
I get to drive Incitatus.

387
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,034
当然了

387
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,034
Of course.

388
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:26,573
我给你开车。

388
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:26,573
I'll drive for you.

389
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,276
但你得阻止雷托杀了我。

389
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,276
But you have to keep
Leto from killing me.

390
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:31,711
我们会尽力的。

390
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:31,711
We'll try our very best.

391
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:49,862
父亲你还没准备好

391
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:49,862
Father, you're not ready.

392
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,368
- 父亲？- 你说什么？

392
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,368
- Father?
- Huh?

393
00:33:58,238 --> 00:33:59,605
我弄错了

393
00:33:58,238 --> 00:33:59,605
I made a mistake.

394
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,740
我犯了一个可怕的错误。

394
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,740
I made a terrible mistake.

395
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:05,511
- 一个错误？- 是啊

395
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:05,511
- A mistake?
- Yeah.

396
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,449
我们的步兵太远了。

396
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,449
Our infantry is too far away.

397
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,751
我应该保留六个步兵团作为后备。

397
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,751
I should have kept six
cohorts of infantry in reserve.

398
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,088
- 你应该休息。- 你说什么？

398
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,088
- You should rest.
- Huh?

399
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:17,023
- 你应该休息。- 是谁？

399
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:17,023
- You should rest.
- Who?

400
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:19,626
- 来了- 喂。

400
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:19,626
- Come.
- Oi.

401
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:29,668
谢谢

401
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:29,668
Thank you.

402
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,773
我知道我可以永远依靠你..

402
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,773
I know I can
always rely on you...

403
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:39,778
泰特斯

403
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:39,778
Titus.

404
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,652
泰特斯

404
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,652
Titus.

405
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
是的，父亲。

405
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Yes, Father.

406
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,525
做该做的事。

406
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,525
Do what needs to be done.

407
00:35:31,664 --> 00:35:33,298
你应该更信任我，兄弟。

407
00:35:31,664 --> 00:35:33,298
You should trust
me more, brother.

408
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,635
我最想要的就是这个

408
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,635
There's nothing I'd like more.

409
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:38,170
我会等财政部的人告诉我是否可以。

409
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:38,170
I'll wait for the count of the
Treasury to tell me if I can.

410
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,639
到时候我会接受你的道歉

410
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,639
Well, I'll accept your
apology when the time comes.

411
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:45,045
父亲身体不舒服

411
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:45,045
Father is, uh, indisposed.

412
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,713
他今天不会来了。

412
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,713
He won't be joining us today.

413
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:03,829
我发誓我要把他们全杀了

413
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:03,829
By the Gods, I'll kill them all!

414
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:08,034
玛索斯安东尼娅卡托尼娅

414
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:08,034
Marsus, Antonia, Caltonia!

415
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:09,536
最重要的是，Xenon！

415
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:09,536
Most of all, Xenon!

416
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,351
兰图勒斯的新战车在哪里？

416
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:16,351
Where are the new special
chariots from Lentullus?

417
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:19,913
他说他们被偷了。

417
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:19,913
He claims that they were stolen.

418
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,449
- 偷来的？- 是的

418
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,449
- Stolen?
- Yes.

419
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,751
我该怎么办呢？

419
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,751
What should I do?

420
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,655
带后备司机来！

420
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,655
Bring up a reserve driver!

421
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,625
使用旧战车！

421
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,625
And use the old chariots!

422
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:36,295
- 天啊！- 你们三个，准备战车。

422
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:36,295
- Dear Gods!
- You three, prepare this chariot.

423
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:38,697
你，备马。

423
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:38,697
You, prepare the horses.

424
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:39,797
来吧！

424
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:39,797
Come on!

425
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,208
罗马的市民们！

425
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,208
Citizens of Rome!

426
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:53,780
我来介绍今天的第一场比赛。

426
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:53,780
I present you, our
first bout of today.

427
00:36:57,516 --> 00:37:01,788
伟大的火焰杀手中的杀手

427
00:36:57,516 --> 00:37:01,788
The Great Flamma,
killer of killers,

428
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,927
阿奎索斯，将战斗

428
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,927
colossus, will do battle

429
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,931
与强大的科隆！

429
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,931
with the mighty Colon!

430
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,744
我们即将死去，

430
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,744
We who are about to die,

431
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:27,579
向您致敬。

431
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:27,579
salute you.

432
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,288
角斗士，准备！

432
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,288
Gladiators, ready!

433
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:41,061
开火！

433
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:41,061
Engage!

434
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:28,407
你，一个军人，觉得血很恶心？

434
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:28,407
You, a soldier, finding
blood distasteful?

435
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,342
不是讨厌。

435
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,342
Not distasteful.

436
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:33,045
浪费。

436
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:33,045
Wasteful.

437
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,757
无论是摆脱，保卫还是扩张我们的边境，

437
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,757
Whether it is shed, defending
or expanding our frontier,

438
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:45,824
这就是血液发挥作用的地方

438
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:45,824
that's where blood
serves a purpose.

439
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:47,693
它在这里也有作用，兄弟。

439
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:47,693
It serves a purpose
here as well, brother.

440
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,583
火焰！火焰！火焰！

440
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,583
Flamma! Flamma! Flamma!

441
00:39:15,722 --> 00:39:18,824
弗拉玛！火焰！火焰！

441
00:39:15,722 --> 00:39:18,824
Flamma! Flamma! Flamma!

442
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:13,847
快点.来了

442
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:13,847
Hurry. Come.

443
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,891
- 多愁善感。- 这是什么？

443
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,891
- Sentimental.
- What is this?

444
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:28,561
Caltonia.

444
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:28,561
Caltonia.

445
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:30,295
哦对不起我以为你知道。

445
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:30,295
Oh, I'm sorry. I
thought you knew.

446
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:31,998
我们又买了500股。

446
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:31,998
We've acquired
another 500 shares.

447
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,199
我认为这使我们成为主要股东。

447
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,199
I believe that makes us
the leading shareholders.

448
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,835
我相信你会觉得这些座位很舒服。

448
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,835
I'm sure you'll find those
seats quite comfortable.

449
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,608
哦，顺便说一句，虽然我们都哀悼

449
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,608
Oh, and by the way,
although we all mourn

450
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:44,376
我们挚爱的天蝎座的逝去

450
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:44,376
the passing of our
beloved Scorpus,

451
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:47,480
我们决定雇佣氙

451
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:47,480
we've taken it upon
ourselves to hire Xenon.

452
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,048
他今天会为我们开车。

452
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,048
He'll be driving for us today.

453
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:52,585
马苏斯你怎么敢

453
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:52,585
Marsus, how dare you?

454
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:54,320
氙是我的司机。

454
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:54,320
Xenon is my driver.

455
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,257
那你应该给你的人更高的薪水参议员好好享受比赛吧。

455
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,257
Then you should pay your people
better, Senator. Enjoy the race.

456
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:26,186
以阿塔加蒂斯的名义，我在哪里？

456
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:26,186
By the name of
Atargatis, where am I?

457
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:29,621
哦妈的我在流血

457
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:29,621
Oh, shit. I'm bleeding.

458
00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:31,391
我们得让它看起来像真实的。

458
00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:31,391
We had to make it look real.

459
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:33,059
是你吗

459
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:33,059
That was you?

460
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,027
你这个肮脏的罗马人。

460
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,027
You filthy Roman.

461
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:40,699
所以你想杀了伟大的天蝎座

461
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:40,699
So, you tried to kill
the great Scorpus, huh?

462
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,202
不当然没有

462
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,202
No, of course not.

463
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:43,969
安东尼娅下令杀了你

463
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:43,969
Antonia ordered your death.

464
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,972
- - 你说什么？- 我是想保证你的安全。

464
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,972
- What?
- I'm trying to keep you safe.

465
00:41:46,072 --> 00:41:48,240
如果你死了，没人会想杀你。

465
00:41:46,072 --> 00:41:48,240
If you're dead, no
one will try to kill you.

466
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:50,577
安东尼娅？

466
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:50,577
Antonia?

467
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:54,547
不，她爱我。

467
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:54,547
No, she loves me.

468
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,949
她有一种特殊的表达方式。

468
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,949
She has a very particular
way of showing it.

469
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,552
还有一件事

469
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,552
And one other thing.

470
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:02,922
你的裁缝送来的。

470
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:02,922
A delivery from your tailor.

471
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:27,179
今天，只有四个派别在为胜利而战。

471
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:27,179
Today, just literally four
factions are running for victory.

472
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,751
有史以来第一次，我们为您呈现...

472
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,751
For the first time in
history, we present you...

473
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,458
黄金阵营！

473
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,458
The Gold Faction!

474
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:48,635
司机，不是别人，

474
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:48,635
With driver, none other than

475
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:51,170
伟大的天蝎座！

475
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:51,170
the great Scorpus!

476
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:52,706
我以为他死了。

476
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:52,706
I thought he was dead.

477
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,280
那些是我们的！

477
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,280
Those are ours!

478
00:43:02,315 --> 00:43:03,315
他们是我们的！

478
00:43:02,315 --> 00:43:03,315
They're ours!

479
00:43:05,652 --> 00:43:07,920
- 天蝎座还活着？- 糟了

479
00:43:05,652 --> 00:43:07,920
- Scorpus is alive?
- Worse.

480
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:10,289
看，氙是为蓝军开车。

480
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:10,289
Look, Xenon is
driving for the Blues.

481
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:17,597
天蝎座还活着！

481
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:17,597
Scorpus is alive!

482
00:43:17,697 --> 00:43:20,666
三百赌天蝎座！黄金阵营。

482
00:43:17,697 --> 00:43:20,666
Three hundred on
Scorpus! Gold Faction.

483
00:43:30,476 --> 00:43:34,280
一个叫Tenax的平民不知怎么筹到了足够的钱

483
00:43:30,476 --> 00:43:34,280
A plebeian, called Tenax
somehow raised enough money

484
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,083
组建一个新的派系从蓝队雇佣天蝎座

484
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,083
to form a new faction and hire
Scorpus away from the Blue.

485
00:43:37,717 --> 00:43:39,719
就是他，在那边

485
00:43:37,717 --> 00:43:39,719
That's him, over there.

486
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:41,521
作为市政官鲁迪，

486
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:41,521
As Aedile Ludi,

487
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:44,260
我想观众看到自己人上台会很高兴。

487
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:44,260
I thought it might please the crowd
to see one of their own up here.

488
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,226
显然，我是对的。

488
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,226
Apparently, I was right.

489
00:43:58,438 --> 00:43:59,972
记住，不要用鞭子。

489
00:43:58,438 --> 00:43:59,972
Remember, no whip.

490
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:01,574
- 只是一个笛鲷。他在哪里？- 天啊，

490
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:01,574
- Just a snapper. Where is he?
- Boy,

491
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:03,275
离开那里

491
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:03,275
get out of there.

492
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,717
战车！

492
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,717
Chariots!

493
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:13,353
准备！

493
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:13,353
Ready!

494
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:17,757
等等等等

494
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:17,757
Wait. Wait.

495
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:19,693
天蝎座。

495
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:19,693
On Scorpus.

496
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,081
来吧！

496
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,081
Come on!

497
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:46,853
啊！啊！

497
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:46,853
Yah! Yah!

498
00:44:55,394 --> 00:44:57,097
我把赌注压在天蝎座身上。

498
00:44:55,394 --> 00:44:57,097
I placed the bet on Scorpus.

499
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:03,503
- 来吧！来吧！- 来吧！

499
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:03,503
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

500
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:05,338
来吧！

500
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:05,338
Come on!

501
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:06,438
是啊是啊

501
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:06,438
Yeah. Yeah.

502
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:21,521
来吧，我们走。比赛开始了来吧我们走

502
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:21,521
Come on, let's go. The
race is on. Come on, let's go.

503
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:24,123
母亲

503
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:24,123
Mother.

504
00:45:26,626 --> 00:45:27,827
啊！

504
00:45:26,626 --> 00:45:27,827
Yah!

505
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,221
快点！快点！

505
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,221
Now!

506
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:23,182
我们怎么打赌？

506
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:23,182
How have we bet?

507
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,650
很严重。

507
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,650
Heavily.

508
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,092
最后一局！最后一局！现在就走！

508
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,092
Last round! Last round! Go now!

509
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,630
啊！

509
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,630
Yah!

510
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,500
啊！

510
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Yah!

511
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:45,438
现在就走！走！

511
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:45,438
Go now! Go!

512
00:46:59,786 --> 00:47:01,454
快点。快点。快点。

512
00:46:59,786 --> 00:47:01,454
Come on. Come on. Come on.

513
00:47:02,922 --> 00:47:05,858
走了走了走！

513
00:47:02,922 --> 00:47:05,858
Go. Go. Go!

514
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:07,626
快点。再快点。

514
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:07,626
Come on. Faster.

515
00:47:07,726 --> 00:47:10,362
更多.给天蝎座更多！

515
00:47:07,726 --> 00:47:10,362
More. Give Scorpus more!

516
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:15,802
坚强点，费罗。

516
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:15,802
Stay strong, Ferox.

517
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,641
Incitatus，保持。

517
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,641
Incitatus, hold.

518
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:25,378
- 等等，因西塔斯。- 你在干什麽？

518
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:25,378
- Hold, Incitatus.
- What are you doing?

519
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:27,612
啊！

519
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:27,612
Yah!

520
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:34,688
是的，我会的

520
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:34,688
Yes!

521
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:38,257
哦，谢谢！

521
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:38,257
Oh, thank you!

522
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,192
你不留下来颁奖吗？

522
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,192
You're not going to stay
and present the laurels?

523
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,543
号

523
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,543
No.

524
00:47:56,643 --> 00:47:59,411
因为我要去参加帝国财政部的会计会议。

524
00:47:56,643 --> 00:47:59,411
Because I have an accounting
of the Imperial Treasury to attend.

525
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:08,588
今天真不错。

525
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:08,588
Quite a day.

526
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:12,559
我只能猜测在你的领导下我们的派系接下来会发生什么。

526
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:12,559
I can only guess what's next for
our faction under your stewardship.

527
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,394
我一想到就不寒而栗。

527
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,394
I shudder to think.

528
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:28,875
该死的黄金阵营！去死吧！

528
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:28,875
Damn the Gold
Faction! Go to hell!

529
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:31,244
从来只有四个派系！

529
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:31,244
There's only ever
been four factions!

530
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:33,947
几个世纪以来都是这样！

530
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:33,947
It has been that
way for centuries!

531
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,648
天蝎座！那个混蛋在哪

531
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,648
Scorpus! Where's that bastard?

532
00:48:39,485 --> 00:48:41,920
我会把你的所作所为报告给帮派老板

532
00:48:39,485 --> 00:48:41,920
I'm gonna report everything
you did to the faction owners.

533
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:43,389
别惹因西塔斯。

533
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:43,389
Leave Incitatus alone.

534
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:48,061
恩，我和因西塔斯是老朋友了。

534
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:48,061
Well, me and
Incitatus are old friends.

535
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:50,864
朋友个屁

535
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:50,864
Friends, my ass.

536
00:48:50,963 --> 00:48:53,199
别管他了，别再玩阴的了。

536
00:48:50,963 --> 00:48:53,199
Just leave him alone
and stop playing dirty.

537
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:02,074
走了

537
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:02,074
Go.

538
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:03,476
你叫什么名字？

538
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:03,476
What was your name?

539
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:04,878
索菲亚。

539
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:04,878
Sofia.

540
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:06,612
我们应该再来一次。

540
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:06,612
We should do this again.

541
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:15,320
你不能再增加一个派系。

541
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:15,320
You can't just add
another faction.

542
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:17,090
太荒谬了！

542
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:17,090
Absolutely ridiculous!

543
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:20,320
两千塞斯特斯换我女儿奥拉的自由

543
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:20,320
Two thousand sesterces for
my daughter Aura's freedom.

544
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,188
这是从哪里来的？

544
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,188
Where did that come from?

545
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:24,523
我在这里赢的，

545
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:24,523
I won it here,

546
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:26,226
from you.

546
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:26,226
from you.

547
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:30,963
我们说好了

547
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:30,963
We agreed.

548
00:50:31,063 --> 00:50:33,333
我的麻烦结束后再决定价格。

548
00:50:31,063 --> 00:50:33,333
I decide the price when
my troubles are over.

549
00:50:33,432 --> 00:50:37,771
据我所知，你的麻烦永远不会结束。

549
00:50:33,432 --> 00:50:37,771
From what I've seen of you,
your troubles will never be over.

550
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:40,706
一千

550
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:40,706
One thousand.

551
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:44,376
你欠我的我告诉了你茱拉的秘密。

551
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:44,376
You owe me for the secrets
I shared with you from Jula.

552
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:50,349
- 一千五- 一千

552
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:50,349
- Fifteen hundred.
- One thousand.

553
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,128
好吧

553
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,128
Fine.

554
00:51:05,998 --> 00:51:07,099
你自由了

554
00:51:05,998 --> 00:51:07,099
You are free.

555
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:10,969
为什么是我？

555
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:10,969
Why me?

556
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,706
妈妈，茱拉和夸梅怎么办？

556
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,706
Mother, what about
Jula and Kwame?

557
00:51:12,806 --> 00:51:14,273
一步一步来，女儿。

557
00:51:12,806 --> 00:51:14,273
One step at a time, daughter.

558
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,177
Tenax！

558
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,177
Tenax!

559
00:51:20,112 --> 00:51:23,215
有四个派系。你听到了吗？四个！

559
00:51:20,112 --> 00:51:23,215
It's four factions.
You hear me? Four!

560
00:51:23,315 --> 00:51:24,516
这是你们的传统。

560
00:51:23,315 --> 00:51:24,516
This is your tradition.

561
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:26,952
你凭什么改变一切？

561
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:26,952
Who are you to
change everything?

562
00:51:29,188 --> 00:51:32,358
伙计们，我们得关门了。

562
00:51:29,188 --> 00:51:32,358
Boys, we need to close up.

563
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:35,427
- 只有四个势力！- 规则被打破了！

563
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:35,427
- There's only four factions!
- The rules were broken!

564
00:53:05,918 --> 00:53:07,786
我听到了，皇帝。

564
00:53:05,918 --> 00:53:07,786
I hear it, the Emperor.

565
00:53:11,023 --> 00:53:12,492
你怎么这么久才来

565
00:53:11,023 --> 00:53:12,492
What took you so long?

566
00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:14,427
你说什么？

566
00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:14,427
Huh?

567
00:53:17,731 --> 00:53:18,831
我要死了

567
00:53:17,731 --> 00:53:18,831
I'm dying.

568
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,340
会计做完后，

568
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,340
After the accounting is done,

569
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,175
派更多的军队去平息暴乱。

569
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,175
send more troops
to quell the riot.

570
00:53:29,275 --> 00:53:30,376
是的，大人。

570
00:53:29,275 --> 00:53:30,376
Yes, my lord.

571
00:53:39,585 --> 00:53:42,355
都在这里，直到最后一个德纳里。

571
00:53:39,585 --> 00:53:42,355
It is all here, to
the last denarii.

572
00:53:42,454 --> 00:53:43,989
所以她骗了我。

572
00:53:42,454 --> 00:53:43,989
So, she deceived me.

573
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:47,327
提图斯将军

573
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:47,327
General Titus.

574
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:49,295
皇帝

574
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:49,295
The Emperor.

575
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:51,864
把我举起来。

575
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:51,864
Lift me up.

576
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:54,934
是啊

576
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:54,934
Yeah.

577
00:53:57,804 --> 00:53:59,505
带我到房间中间。

577
00:53:57,804 --> 00:53:59,505
Take me to the
middle of the room.

578
00:54:01,608 --> 00:54:02,842
- 博萨- 是的

578
00:54:01,608 --> 00:54:02,842
- Bosa!
- Yes.

579
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:04,010
我的月桂。

579
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:04,010
