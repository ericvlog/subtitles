1
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:14,114
以前在那些即将死去的人身上......

1
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:14,114
Previously on
Those About to Die...

2
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,117
他们让我想起了你。尤其是那个安德里亚。

2
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,117
They remind me of you.
Especially that Andria.

3
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,618
我看到有一天他会创造整个罗马

3
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,618
I see a day when he's
making all of Rome

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,120
忘记你曾经存在过。

4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,120
forget you ever existed.

5
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:25,658
执政官马尔苏斯、参议员托雷尔和苏普尔修斯

5
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:25,658
The Consul Marsus, the
Senators Torel and Supulcius

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,861
特此以叛国罪被捕。

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,861
are hereby arrested for treason.

7
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:30,030
但是他做了什么？

7
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:30,030
But what has he done?

8
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,231
他激起了图密善的敌意。

8
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,231
He has excited the
animus of Domitian.

9
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,167
将与Flamma进行二番战。

9
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,167
There will be a
rematch with Flamma.

10
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:39,572
再见了，小昆图斯。

10
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:39,572
Farewell, little Quintus.

11
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:21,581
小心，小心。

11
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:21,581
Careful, careful.

12
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:26,686
注意他的头。

12
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:26,686
Watch his head.

13
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,224
快点，他来了。

13
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,224
Hurry, he's here.

14
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,194
尼卡，我们来得正是时候。

14
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,194
Nica, we were just in time.

15
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,236
医生。快走！

15
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,236
A physician. Go quick!

16
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,272
加油！来。

16
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,272
Come on! Come.

17
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,478
快点，快点！

17
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,478
Hurry, hurry!

18
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:36,322
接下来是她的妹妹。

18
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:36,322
Next, her sister.

19
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,704
你完成了吗？

19
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,704
Are you done?

20
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,451
- 让他以为我死了。- 保持静止。

20
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,451
- Let him think I'm dead.
- Be still.

21
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,788
我尽可能快地来了。

21
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,788
I came as quick as I could.

22
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,428
罂粟酊剂。

22
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,428
Tincture of poppies.

23
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,798
把他的鞋子脱掉。

23
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,798
Get his shoes off.

24
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:08,742
你将需要它。

24
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:08,742
You're going to need it.

25
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,223
当我说时，缓慢而稳定地拉动。

25
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,223
When I say, pull
slowly and steadily.

26
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,761
当我说的时候，释放得非常慢。

26
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,761
When I say, release very slowly.

27
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,411
拉。

27
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,411
Pull.

28
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,389
释放。

28
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,389
Release.

29
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,740
准备一些热水。

29
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,740
Prepare some hot water.

30
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,014
发生了什么事情？

30
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,014
What's happening?

31
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,516
-发生了什么事？- 就是那个狗屎诺罗。

31
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,516
- What happened?
- It was that shit Noro.

32
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,785
他设置了他。

32
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,785
He set him up.

33
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,687
他没事。去。

33
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,687
He is all right. Go.

34
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,406
如果他移动，它会解开夹板。

34
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,406
If he moves at all, it
will unset the splint.

35
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,408
然后他会失去一条腿。

35
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,408
Then he'll lose the leg.

36
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,511
如果有必要，就把他绑起来。

36
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,511
Tie him down if you have to.

37
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,514
三碗树脂配酒，早、中、晚。

37
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,514
Three bowls of resin with
wine, morning, noon and night.

38
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,451
他会想要更多。不要给他。

38
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,451
He will want more.
Don't give it to him.

39
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:00,920
我理解。

39
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:00,920
I understand.

40
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,589
如果有一丝腐烂的迹象，马上来找我。

40
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,589
If there's a hint of rot,
come get me at once.

41
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:12,632
诺罗，那条奸诈的狗。

41
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:12,632
Noro, that treacherous dog.

42
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,033
我早该知道的。

42
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,033
I should have known.

43
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,668
好吧，他现在已经死了。

43
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,668
Well, he's dead now.

44
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,637
对特纳克斯做这件事的人活着，

44
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,637
The one who did
this to Tenax lives,

45
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:22,641
如果他听说他活了下来，他会回来找他。

45
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:22,641
and if he hears he has survived,
he will come back for him.

46
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,045
我会派警卫，我可以信任的人。

46
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,045
I'll post guards,
men that I can trust.

47
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,047
好吧，把它们藏起来。

47
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,047
Well, keep them hidden.

48
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,483
让这样做的人认为他已经死了。

48
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,483
Let the one who did
this think he is dead.

49
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:34,220
现在，去Cispian Hill的公寓，

49
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:34,220
Now, go to the apartment
on the Cispian Hill,

50
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,122
他把金子放在哪里。

50
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,122
where he's been
putting the gold.

51
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,923
看看它是否还在。

51
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,923
See if it's still there.

52
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,894
我接受特纳克斯的命令，而不是你的命令，女人。

52
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,894
I take orders from Tenax,
not from you, woman.

53
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,334
当他醒来时，

53
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,334
When he wakes,

54
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,901
你愿意我们告诉他吗

54
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,901
would you rather we tell him

55
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,538
我们做了他希望我们做的事，

55
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,538
that we did what he would
have wanted us to do,

56
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,742
或者你做出了所有的决定，无论对错，

56
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,742
or that you made all the
decisions, right or wrong,

57
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,845
大多是错的？

57
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,845
mostly wrong?

58
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:07,052
好吧。伍拉，过来。

58
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:07,052
All right. Woola, come.

59
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,560
之后，来到小酒馆。

59
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,560
After that, come to the tavern.

60
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,829
我们像往常一样设置投注。

60
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,829
We set up for
betting like normal.

61
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,153
你去哪了？

61
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,153
Where have you been?

62
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,389
-外。- 通宵达旦。

62
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,389
- Out.
- All night.

63
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,956
看起来是这样。

63
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,956
So it would seem.

64
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,663
发生了什么事？

64
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,663
What happened?

65
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,600
䏃。

65
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,600
Listen carefully.

66
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,302
去酒馆打开它。

66
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,302
Go to the tavern and open it up.

67
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,838
如果有人问起Tenax，

67
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,838
If anyone asks about Tenax,

68
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:36,042
告诉他们他要去海岸附近买地。

68
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:36,042
tell them he's away
buying land near the coast.

69
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:40,179
但让他们认为你在撒谎。

69
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:40,179
But let them
think you are lying.

70
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,947
我。。。我不明白。

70
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,947
I... I don't understand.

71
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,884
你善于撒谎。

71
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,884
You are good at lying.

72
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,822
假装不擅长。

72
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,822
Pretend to be bad at it.

73
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,457
他的一些敌人需要认为他还活着。

73
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,457
Some of his enemies
need to think him alive.

74
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,625
有些人需要认为他已经死了。

74
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,625
Some need to think him dead.

75
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:05,004
对特纳克斯这样做的人会急切地对我们做同样的事情。

75
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:05,004
The man who did that to Tenax
would eagerly do the same to us.

76
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:09,975
去。

76
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:09,975
Go.

77
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,711
他走了。

77
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,711
He's gone.

78
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,113
黄金也是如此。

78
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,113
So is the gold.

79
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,283
停。

79
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,283
Stop.

80
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,590
停。请停下来。

80
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,590
Stop. Please, stop.

81
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,798
醒来。醒来，你在梦中。

81
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,798
Wake up. Wake up,
you are in a dream.

82
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,133
你在你的房间里。你很安全。

82
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,133
You're in your
room. You're safe.

83
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,245
当我还是个孩子的时候，我住在一个很棒的家庭里。

83
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,245
I lived with a great
family when I was a boy.

84
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,116
房子的主人，

84
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,116
The master of the house,

85
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,321
他喜欢男孩。

85
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,321
he liked boys.

86
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,657
本人。。。

86
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,657
Myself...

87
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,559
但主要是乌尔苏斯。

87
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,559
But mostly Ursus.

88
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,260
乌尔苏斯。

88
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,260
Ursus.

89
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,897
- 我们是... - 停下来。

89
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,897
- We were...
- Stop.

90
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:40,866
这是罂粟花的酊剂在说话。

90
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:40,866
This is tincture
of poppies talking.

91
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,136
不。是我。

91
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,136
No. It's me.

92
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,841
乌尔苏斯和我点燃了一堆火逃跑。

92
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,841
Ursus and I lit
a fire to escape.

93
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,611
我逃走了。

93
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,611
I got away.

94
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,947
但乌尔苏斯被抓住了。

94
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,947
But Ursus was caught.

95
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,216
因为我，

95
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,216
Because of me,

96
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,587
他受苦了。但是我......

96
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,587
he suffered. But I...

97
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,756
你做了你必须做的事。

97
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,756
You did what you had to do.

98
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,091
我不知道我做了什么。

98
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,091
I don't know what I've done.

99
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,928
他需要我，我把他留在那里。

99
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,928
He needed me
and I left him there.

100
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,866
更多的罂粟酊剂。

100
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,866
More tincture of poppies.

101
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,514
-更多。- 够了，医生说。

101
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,514
- More.
- That's enough, the physician said.

102
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,149
你为我工作，而不是为医生工作。

102
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,149
You work for me,
not the physician.

103
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,384
我会服从医生为你工作。

103
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,384
I'll work for you by
obeying the physician.

104
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,125
不见了。而且没有这个乌尔苏斯的迹象。

104
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,125
It's gone. And no
sign of this Ursus.

105
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,397
我派他去看看金子是否还在。

105
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,397
I sent him to see if
the gold was still there.

106
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,270
这边。

106
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,270
This way.

107
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,241
老公。

107
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,241
Husband.

108
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,177
你不应该在这样的地方。

108
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,177
You shouldn't be in
a place such as this.

109
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,214
罗马女主人应该永远在丈夫身边。

109
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,214
A Roman matron should
always be at her husband's side.

110
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,048
不在这里。

110
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,048
Not here.

111
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,453
我试图获得提多的听众。他拒绝了。

111
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,453
I tried to obtain an audience
with Titus. He refused.

112
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,888
科妮莉亚？

112
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,888
Cornelia?

113
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,458
我试过了。她背对着我们。

113
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,458
I tried. She turned
her back on us.

114
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,296
我们误判了把她交给维斯塔尔对我们和朱利叶斯意味着什么。

114
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,296
We misjudged what giving her to the
Vestals would mean for us and Julius.

115
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,030
而对她来说。

115
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,030
And for her.

116
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,234
我与自己的命运和解了。

116
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,234
I'm reconciled to my fate.

117
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:25,504
我一定还能做些什么。

117
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:25,504
There must be
something else I can do.

118
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,274
-有。-什么？

118
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,274
- There is.
- What?

119
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,943
不要再来这里了，答应我。

119
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,943
Don't come here ever
again, promise me.

120
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,913
-不。- 想想我们的儿子。

120
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,913
- No.
- Think of our son.

121
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,519
保护自己和朱利叶斯的唯一方法就是谴责我。

121
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,519
The only way to protect yourself
and Julius is to denounce me.

122
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,787
不。

122
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,787
No.

123
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,456
你必须公开说话，叫我傻瓜。

123
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,456
You must speak
publicly, call me a fool.

124
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,826
篡位者。诅咒我的名字，

124
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,826
A usurper. Curse my name,

125
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,528
- 我疯狂的野心。-不。

125
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,528
- my mad ambition.
- No.

126
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,029
吐在我的坟墓上。

126
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,029
Spit on my grave.

127
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,332
- 告诉我的儿子也这样做。-不。

127
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,332
- Tell my son to do the same.
- No.

128
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,402
我怎样才能做这样的事情？不！

128
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,402
How can I do such things? No!

129
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,772
我们已经以我们庄严的家庭的名义牺牲了太多。

129
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,772
We've already sacrificed too much
in the name of our august families.

130
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,441
保护我们的名字是你的责任。

130
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,441
It is your duty to
protect our name.

131
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,476
你的名字，朱利叶斯的名字。

131
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,476
Your name, Julius' name.

132
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,014
我死了。

132
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,014
I'm dead.

133
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,383
如果你和他要茁壮成长，就必须被遗忘。

133
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,383
And must be forgotten if
you and him are to thrive.

134
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,019
铜椅不适合我。

134
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,019
The curule chair
was not meant for me.

135
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,957
但是朱利叶斯......等待你的时间。

135
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,957
But Julius... Bide your time.

136
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,461
让那些挡在你面前的人感到困惑。

136
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,461
Confound those who
would stand in your way.

137
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,961
比那些平民败类活得更久

137
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,961
Outlive those plebeian scum

138
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,631
看到我们的儿子登上皇权。

138
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,631
and see our son
risen to imperial power.

139
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,500
把我们的儿子放在铜椅上。

139
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,500
Put our son on the curule chair.

140
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,836
在那之后，他的儿子。

140
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,836
And his son after that.

141
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,471
- 停下来，你打伤了我。- 包扎伤口。

141
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,471
- Stop, you wound me.
- Bind your wounds.

142
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,573
让他们伤痕累累！

142
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,573
Let them scar!

143
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,078
转身离开我。

143
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,078
Turn from me.

144
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,413
拯救自己。

144
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,413
Save yourself.

145
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,415
救救我们的儿子。

145
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,415
Save our son.

146
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,221
我们的姓氏。

146
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,221
Our family name.

147
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,493
不，拜托，不！

147
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,493
No, please, no!

148
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,268
我已经忍住了足够长的时间。

148
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,268
I have held my
tongue long enough.

149
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,269
关于？

149
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,269
In respect of?

150
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,006
你从来没有骗过我。你误导了我。

150
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,006
You have never lied to
me. You have misled me.

151
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,783
你让我相信我的人民会自由

151
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,783
You had me believe that
my people would be free

152
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,119
当您的圆形剧场完工时。

152
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,119
when your amphitheater
was completed.

153
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,578
拜托，拜托，拜托，拜托。

153
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,578
Please, please, please, please.

154
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,347
足够。

154
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,347
Enough.

155
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,951
人们，他们被当作战利品。

155
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,951
People, they were
taken as a spoil of war.

156
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,052
他们现在属于罗马。

156
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,052
They belong to Rome now.

157
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,489
参议员们已经对他们的客户耳语了

157
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,489
Senators already
whisper to their clients

158
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,758
众神剥光了大地来惩罚我。

158
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,758
that the Gods stripped
the very earth to punish me.

159
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,125
你是说我？

159
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,125
You mean me?

160
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:30,562
也许，虽然主要是我，因为你把你当作我的配偶。

160
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:30,562
Perhaps, though mostly me,
for taking you as my consort.

161
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,100
你娶了一个妻子，把我放在阴影里。

161
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,100
You have taken a wife and
placed me in the shadows.

162
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,336
他们还能要求你什么呢？

162
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,336
What more can they ask of you?

163
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,272
他们要你走。

163
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,272
They want you gone.

164
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,210
没有另一个克利奥帕特拉的地方

164
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,210
There's no place
for another Cleopatra

165
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,312
毒害他们皇帝的耳朵。

165
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,312
poisoning the ear
of their emperor.

166
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,315
那是你哥哥在说话，不是你。

166
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,315
That is your brother
speaking, not you.

167
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,283
不，他已经证明了他对我的忠诚。

167
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,283
No, he's proven
his loyalty to me.

168
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,153
不。他说服了你他的忠诚。

168
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,153
No. He convinced
you of his loyalty.

169
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,557
他已经履行了他对我的责任，就像我必须履行我的职责一样。

169
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,557
He's fulfilled his duty to
me, just as I must fulfill mine.

170
00:15:58,725 --> 00:15:59,625
所以我要等待

170
00:15:58,725 --> 00:15:59,625
So I am to wait

171
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,495
当我的人民死在你们的建筑营地里时？

171
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,495
while my people die in
your construction camps?

172
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,597
不是现在。

172
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,597
Not now.

173
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,269
我有我的职责。

173
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,269
I have my duties.

174
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,403
如？

174
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,403
Such as?

175
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,142
罗马城。

175
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,142
The city of Rome.

176
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,548
你们中有人知道安东尼娅为什么召集这次会议吗？

176
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,548
Do any of you know why
Antonia called this meeting?

177
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,850
这有关系吗？

177
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,850
Does it matter?

178
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,518
马苏斯领事不会在这里。

178
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,518
Consul Marsus won't be here.

179
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,922
叛徒们正在他们真正属于的地方徘徊。

179
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,922
The traitors are languishing
away where they truly belong.

180
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,957
我亲爱的卡尔托尼亚，恐怕这次会议

180
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,957
My dear Caltonia,
I'm afraid this meeting

181
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,927
只适用于派系的主要所有者。

181
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,927
is only for the lead
owners of the factions.

182
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,730
虽然这么说让我很痛苦，但你可以走了。

182
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,730
Though it pains me
to say so, you may go.

183
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,067
你怎么敢？

183
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,067
How dare you?

184
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,135
你的丈夫因叛国罪入狱......

184
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,135
Your husband is
imprisoned for treason...

185
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,272
让我成为蓝色派系的主要所有者。

185
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,272
Making me lead owner
of the Blue Faction.

186
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,142
现在，走吧。

186
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,142
Now, go.

187
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,648
但在你走之前，亲爱的

187
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,648
But before you go, my dear

188
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,250
我希望你们都听到这句话。

188
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,250
I want you all to hear this.

189
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,653
我丈夫

189
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,653
My husband

190
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,556
背叛了罗马

190
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,556
has betrayed Rome

191
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,492
还有我们的皇帝。

191
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,492
and our emperor.

192
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,563
他应该为他的罪行而死。

192
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,563
He deserves to
die for his crime.

193
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:14,233
从这一刻起，我的丈夫对我们一家人来说已经死了。

193
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:14,233
From this moment on, my
husband is dead to our family.

194
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,270
他对我们的儿子朱利叶斯来说已经死了，

194
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,270
He's dead to our son, Julius,

195
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,142
他对我来说已经死了。

195
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,142
and he's dead to me.

196
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,577
你现在可以走了，卡尔托尼亚。

196
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,577
You may go now, Caltonia.

197
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,317
所以。。。

197
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,317
So...

198
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,555
让我们进入正题。

198
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,555
Let us get down to business.

199
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,401
什么？

199
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,401
What?

200
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,871
我想到了你前几天说的话。

200
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,871
I thought about what
you said the other day.

201
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,573
也许你是对的。

201
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,573
And maybe you are right.

202
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,607
也许我应该这样做

202
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,607
Maybe I should

203
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,545
偶尔玩得开心。

203
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,545
have fun once in a while.

204
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,515
天蝎座永远是对的。

204
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,515
Scorpus is always right.

205
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,251
那我们走吧。我们来喝一杯吧。

205
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,251
Let's go, then.
Let's get a drink.

206
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,282
老公，你要走了？

206
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,282
Husband, you're leaving?

207
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:44,124
我会让祭司祈祷，让占卜师为一个男孩举行仪式。

207
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:44,124
I'll have the priests pray and the
augurs perform the rituals for a boy.

208
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,692
现在，如果你快点，请立即通知我。

208
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,692
Now, if you quicken,
inform me immediately.

209
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,230
否则，下次准备好时，请在一个月内寄给我。

209
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,230
Otherwise, send for me in
a month when next ready.

210
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
打开。

210
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Open.

211
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,006
我的母亲在我们很小的时候就去世了。

211
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,006
My mother died when
we were very young.

212
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,441
在那之前，我和我的双胞胎兄弟，

212
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,441
Until then, my
twin brother and I,

213
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,243
我们过着美好的生活。

213
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,243
we had a great life.

214
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:08,548
农场里有马和男孩梦寐以求的一切。

214
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:08,548
Farm with horses and
everything a boy dreams of.

215
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,682
但是，

215
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,682
But then,

216
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,252
在我母亲去世后，

216
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,252
after my mother's death,

217
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,422
我父亲开始喝酒，

217
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,422
my father began drinking,

218
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,092
后来，我哥哥也追随了他的脚步。

218
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,092
and later, my brother
followed in his footsteps.

219
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,895
他们因我无法理解的东西而结缘。

219
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,895
They bonded over stuff
I couldn't understand.

220
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,498
我不想明白。

220
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,498
I didn't want to understand.

221
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,303
嗯？是的。

221
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,303
Hmm? Yes.

222
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,238
你是什么时候开始参加比赛的？

222
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,238
When did you start racing?

223
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,575
我已经告诉过你了。我们俩很早就这样做了。

223
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,575
I already told you.
We both did early on.

224
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,479
但是我哥哥到处嫖娼，喝多了。

224
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,479
But my brother whored
around and drank too much.

225
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,147
他很好。

225
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,147
He was good.

226
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,049
他非常好。他比我好。

226
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,049
He was very good.
He was better than me.

227
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,617
赛道上的自然人。

227
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,617
A natural on the racetrack.

228
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,719
但。。。

228
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,719
But...

229
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,757
他缺乏纪律。

229
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,757
he lacked discipline.

230
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,026
就像你一样。

230
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,026
Just like you.

231
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,493
他叫什么名字？

231
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,493
What was his name?

232
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,699
塞克斯图斯。

232
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,699
Sextus.

233
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,570
是的，好吧，有这样的名字......

233
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,570
Yeah, well, with
a name like that...

234
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,749
你很有趣。

234
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,749
You're funny.

235
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,452
已经太多了。

235
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,452
Too much already.

236
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:28,694
当有理由庆祝时，人们应该庆祝。

236
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:28,694
When there's cause to
celebrate, one should celebrate.

237
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,731
所以你确定我们会获胜？

237
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,731
So you're certain
we will prevail?

238
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,000
我的律师很清楚。

238
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,000
My lawyers are clear.

239
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:39,538
你在蓝色派系的股份将是你的，然后是我的。

239
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:39,538
Your shares in the Blue Faction
will be yours, and then mine.

240
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,877
然后，你和你的儿子将拥有财富的安全感。

240
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,877
And then, you and your son
will have the security of wealth.

241
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,147
我不需要财富。

241
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,147
I don't need wealth.

242
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,349
你还太年轻，不知道。

242
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,349
You're too young to know that.

243
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,386
你知道，我们都需要不同的东西。

243
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,386
You know, we all
need different things.

244
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,890
渴望不同的东西。

244
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,890
Desire different things.

245
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,762
我们一起喝酒

245
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,762
We'll drink together

246
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,632
到我们需要的东西。

246
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,632
to the things we need.

247
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:13,373
还有我们想要的东西。

247
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:13,373
And the things we desire.

248
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:16,808
嗯？

248
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:16,808
Hmm?

249
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,517
卡尔托尼亚，我......

249
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,517
Caltonia, I'm...

250
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:36,895
允许我吗？

250
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:36,895
Allow me?

251
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:58,050
你以为我这么小吗？我会把自己卖给你吗？

251
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:58,050
You think that little of me?
That I will sell myself to you?

252
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,486
塞莱娜。。。

252
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,486
Selena...

253
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,820
请稍候。

253
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,820
Please, wait.

254
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:05,959
塞莱娜。

254
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:05,959
Selena.

255
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,564
我需要小便。

255
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,564
I need to take a piss.

256
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,509
这感觉很好。

256
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,509
That feels good.

257
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:29,982
喔！

257
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:29,982
Whoo!

258
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,085
来吧，它就在那里。

258
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,085
Come, it's there.

259
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,093
来。

259
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,093
Come.

260
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,265
- 萨莱娜。-原谅我。

260
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,265
- Salena.
- Forgive me.

261
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,445
我们无处可去。

261
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,445
We have nowhere else to go.

262
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,734
发生了什么事？

262
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,734
What happened?

263
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,569
我不能再呆在原地了。

263
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,569
I cannot stay where
I was anymore.

264
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,673
为什么？没关系，来吧。

264
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,673
Why? It doesn't matter, come.

265
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,607
过来这里。

265
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,607
Come here.

266
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,077
什么。。。

266
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,077
What...

267
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,150
他的名字叫费罗克斯。

267
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,150
His name is Ferox.

268
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:39,885
他像风一样快。

268
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:39,885
He's as fast as the wind.

269
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,621
这里。

269
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,621
Here.

270
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,684
我来这里是想说对不起。

270
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,684
I have come to
say that I am sorry.

271
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,653
你确定你不想杀我吗？

271
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,653
Are you sure you
don't want to kill me?

272
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:16,623
我从来不知道你。

272
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:16,623
I never know with you.

273
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:19,092
我希望你回到我们的蓝色阵营。

273
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:19,092
I want you to come
back to our Blue Faction.

274
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,868
出去。

274
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,868
Get out.

275
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:30,970
去。

275
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:30,970
Go.

276
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,494
我就知道你会回来的。

276
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,494
I knew you would come back.

277
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:47,186
我怎么能远离伟大的天蝎座呢？

277
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:47,186
How could I stay away
from the great Scorpus?

278
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,612
扶我起来。

278
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,612
Help me up.

279
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,682
不 不 不。现在这样做，你就会失去一条腿。

279
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,682
No, no, no. Do that
now and you lose the leg.

280
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,148
罂粟。

280
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,148
Poppies.

281
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,122
加油。

281
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,122
Come on.

282
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,461
中午更多。

282
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,461
More at midday.

283
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,730
我要去准备下注。

283
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,730
I'm going to go set
up for the betting.

284
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,894
对不起，伟大的天蝎座。

284
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,894
I'm sorry, great Scorpus.

285
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,297
但我不能让你为反对派骑马。

285
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,297
But I can't have you
ride for the opposition.

286
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,068
所以，你们都明白。

286
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,068
So, you all understand.

287
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:12,771
你仔细观察，看看谁刚刚迷路了，

287
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:12,771
You watch closely
to see who's just lost,

288
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:16,509
你悄悄地向他们提供反向赔率。

288
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:16,509
and you quietly offer
them reverse odds.

289
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,011
为此，我们每次下注都会得到一个 sesterce？

289
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,011
And for that we get
a sesterce every bet?

290
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,749
只要你不被抓住。

290
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,749
As long as you don't get caught.

291
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,619
天蝎座在哪里？

291
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,619
Where is Scorpus?

292
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:28,988
妈妈，没有人在赌金子

292
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:28,988
Mother, no one is betting gold

293
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,156
只有一辆黄金战车在运行。

293
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,156
with only one Gold
chariot running.

294
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,771
从Tenax订购。

294
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,771
Order from Tenax.

295
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,807
你们俩今天都在比赛。

295
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,807
Both of you are racing today.

296
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,407
什么？

296
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,407
What?

297
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,344
-我？- 嗯嗯。

297
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,344
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,747
天蝎座呢？

298
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,747
What about Scorpus?

299
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:58,117
天蝎座无处可寻，我们需要两个司机。

299
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:58,117
Scorpus is nowhere to be
found, and we need two drivers.

300
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,230
你以为你得到了我，但我得到了你。

300
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,230
You thought you
got me but I got you.

301
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:31,584
祝你好运，兄弟们。像索尔本人一样骑行。

301
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:31,584
Good luck, brothers.
Ride like Sol himself.

302
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:35,954
冠军们，准备好了！

302
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:35,954
Champions, ready!

303
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,843
去，去，去，去！

303
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,843
Go, go, go, go!

304
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,595
移动，移动！

304
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,595
Move, move!

305
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,962
让开。

305
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,962
Get out of my way.

306
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:39,118
哎呀！

306
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:39,118
Hyah!

307
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,189
哎呀！哎呀！

307
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,189
Hyah! Hyah!

308
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:52,332
安德里亚！安德里亚！安德里亚！

308
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:52,332
Andria! Andria! Andria!

309
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,072
为什么天蝎座不骑马？

309
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,072
Why isn't Scorpus riding?

310
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:01,941
哎呀！哎呀！

310
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:01,941
Hyah! Hyah!

311
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,352
干得好，安德里亚！

311
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,352
Well done, Andria!

312
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:21,027
安德里亚！安德里亚！安德里亚！

312
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:21,027
Andria! Andria! Andria!

313
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:37,176
我喝醉了，我他妈的被蝎子咬了。

313
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:37,176
I was drunk and I was fucking
and I was bitten by a scorpion.

314
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,311
-不是我的错。-冷静。

314
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,311
- It's not my fault.
- Calm down.

315
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:44,017
很好。它减轻了你的压力。

315
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:44,017
It's good. It takes
the pressure off you.

316
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,952
我们会培训候补司机，以防您再次被咬伤

316
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,952
We train alternate drivers
in case you're bitten again

317
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,489
或者你喝醉了，或者你在做爱。

317
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,489
or you're drunk
or you're fucking.

318
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,257
互生？

318
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,257
Alternate?

319
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,493
互生？天蝎座没有替代品。

319
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,493
Alternate? There is
no alternate to Scorpus.

320
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,829
-是的。而且，没有。-是的。

320
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,829
- Well, yes. And, no.
- Yes.

321
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,832
你现在不仅仅是一个司机。

321
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,832
You're more than a driver now.

322
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,232
您是所有者。

322
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,232
You're an owner.

323
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:03,303
- 我们赢了。- 马屁。

323
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:03,303
- And we won.
- Horseshit.

324
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:07,207
这是你一直以来的计划吗？嗯？你要我走吗？

324
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:07,207
Was this your plan all along?
Hmm? You want me gone?

325
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:08,340
天蝎座。

325
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:08,340
Scorpus.

326
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,109
当然不是。

326
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,109
Of course not.

327
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,846
但比赛必须放在第一位，

327
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,846
But the racing
has to come first,

328
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,346
最近，

328
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,346
and recently,

329
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,884
看来你对喝酒和嫖娼更感兴趣。

329
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,884
it seems like you're more
interested in drinking and whoring.

330
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,885
你不明白。

330
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,885
You don't understand.

331
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:23,155
赛车的一部分是喝酒和嫖娼。

331
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:23,155
Part of racing is
drinking and whoring.

332
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,990
你不能没有其他的。

332
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,990
You cannot have
one without the others.

333
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,160
这是赛车，喝酒，嫖娼。

333
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,160
It's racing, drinking, whoring.

334
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,628
他们是一个团队。是的，就像马一样。

334
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,628
They are a team.
Yes, like the horses.

335
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:30,829
什么？

335
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:30,829
What?

336
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,567
赛车使我变得富有。

336
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,567
Racing made me rich.

337
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:39,005
我把我的名字改成了天蝎座，因为没有人能说出我的真名。

337
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:39,005
I changed my name to Scorpus because
nobody could pronounce my real name.

338
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,573
我喜欢喝酒。

338
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,573
I like to drink.

339
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:41,673
喝酒让我快乐。

339
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:41,673
Drinking makes me happy.

340
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,444
幸福让我想做爱，因为我出名了，

340
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,444
Happiness makes me want to
fuck, and because I am famous,

341
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:46,545
我可以操我喜欢的人。

341
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:46,545
I can fuck who I like.

342
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:50,083
唾弃这些礼物将是对福尔图纳的侮辱。

342
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:50,083
To spurn these gifts would
be an insult to Fortuna.

343
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,353
她诅咒我的驾驶，天蝎座已经不在了。

343
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,353
She curses my driving
and Scorpus is no more.

344
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:08,734
你打算什么时候交出我的那部分利润？

344
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:08,734
When were you planning to
hand over my portion of the profits?

345
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:10,069
我听说你已经死了。

345
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:10,069
I was told you were dead.

346
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,713
我不想发现谣言是真的，

346
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,713
I'd hate to discover
that rumor were true,

347
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:13,906
那么我的钱在哪里？

347
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:13,906
so where is my money?

348
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,575
我们的钱在哪里？

348
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,575
Where is our money?

349
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,479
我可以解释，殿下。

349
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,479
I can explain, Your Highness.

350
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,214
你的钱，我们的钱......

350
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,214
Your money, our money...

351
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,250
不见了。

351
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,250
is gone.

352
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:30,656
去向威胁要透露某事的人支付敲诈勒索......

352
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:30,656
Gone to pay extortion to someone
threatening to reveal something...

353
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:32,092
关于我？

353
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:32,092
About me?

354
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,558
不。

354
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,558
No.

355
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,327
我。

355
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,327
Me.

356
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:37,496
关于我的过去，

356
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:37,496
About my past,

357
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,199
在我来罗马之前。

357
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,199
before I came to Rome.

358
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,968
- 那是谁对你做的？-是的。

358
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,968
- That's who did this to you?
- Yes.

359
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,838
我不在乎你前世的尿液，

359
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,838
I don't care one piss
about your past life,

360
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:48,942
虽然我很难想象它比现在更糟糕。

360
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:48,942
though I struggle to imagine it
was worse than this present one.

361
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,644
我所关心的只是我需要的钱。

361
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,644
All I care about is
the money I need.

362
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,513
你欠我的钱。

362
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,513
The money that you owe me.

363
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:05,858
立即解决这个问题。

363
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:05,858
Solve this now.

364
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:08,028
否则我会让你受苦

364
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:08,028
Or I will make you suffer

365
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:12,298
以你的勒索者梦寐以求的方式。

365
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:12,298
in ways your extortionist
could only dream of.

366
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,443
还有你和他一起。

366
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,443
And you along with him.

367
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,681
我？

367
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,681
Me?

368
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,282
不 不。。。

368
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,282
No, no...

369
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,519
我做了什么？

369
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,519
What did I do?

370
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,824
顺便说一句，你看起来很糟糕。

370
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,824
You look terrible, by the way.

371
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,392
是的，我可以想象。

371
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,392
Yeah, I can imagine.

372
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,493
你想要一面镜子吗？

372
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,493
You want a mirror?

373
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:49,001
不，不，数字不符。

373
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:49,001
No, no, the numbers don't tally.

374
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,676
所以，你已经走了

374
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,676
So, you have gone

375
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,446
超越我最疯狂的梦想。

375
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,446
beyond my wildest dreams.

376
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:03,115
来这里，领取你的奖励。

376
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:03,115
Come here, collect your rewards.

377
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:19,365
没有变黑。

377
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:19,365
Hasn't gone black.

378
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,534
这很好。

378
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,534
Which is good.

379
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,813
罂粟花的酊剂在哪里？我一直在努力寻找它。

379
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,813
Where's the tincture of
poppies? I've been trying to find it.

380
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,605
这就是我隐藏它的原因。

380
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,605
Which is why I hid it.

381
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,641
- 把它拿给我。-不。

381
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,641
- Bring it to me.
- No.

382
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,243
你太过分了。

382
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,243
You overreach yourself.

383
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,113
我愿意。

383
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,113
That I do.

384
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,279
和

384
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,279
And,

385
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:38,917
我今天在比赛中也超越了自己。

385
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:38,917
I overreached myself at
the races today as well.

386
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,421
我们在铃声响起后下注。

386
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,421
We took bets after the bell.

387
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,124
什么？他们会让我们闭嘴的！

387
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,124
What? They'll shut us down!

388
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,026
冷静。我们没有被抓到。

388
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,026
Calm down. We weren't caught.

389
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,826
我承受不起这个风险。

389
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,826
I can't afford the risk.

390
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,530
也许你是对的。

390
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,530
Perhaps you're right.

391
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,083
从今天开始？

391
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,083
All from today?

392
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:17,590
好吧，好吧，只是不要被抓住。

392
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:17,590
All right, well, just
don't get caught.

393
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,494
去看看克劳迪娅，她会给你一些奖励。

393
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,494
And go and see Claudia,
she'll give you some rewards.

394
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:22,728
是的！

394
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:22,728
Yes!

395
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:30,469
我们需要重新谈判我们的协议。

395
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:30,469
We will need to
renegotiate our deal.

396
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:33,840
我病了。稍后再来。

396
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:33,840
I'm ill. Come back later.

397
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:50,389
你想要一些吗？很好。

397
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:50,389
You want some? It's good.

398
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,791
不,谢谢。这是给你的。

398
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,791
No, thank you. It's for you.

399
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,398
弗拉玛这次会拥有他。

399
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,398
Flamma will have him this time.

400
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,599
但福尔图纳偏爱努米底亚人。

400
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,599
But Fortuna favors the Numidian.

401
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,603
她饶过夸梅一次。12-1是有利的赔率。

401
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,603
She spared Kwame once.
12-1 are favorable odds.

402
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,806
即使在 100-1，你的非洲人也死了。

402
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,806
Even at 100-1,
your African is dead.

403
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,784
-请。-闭。

403
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,784
- Please.
- Closed.

404
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,452
开放是有价的。

404
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,452
Open for a price.

405
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:25,657
你需要什么？

405
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:25,657
What do you need?

406
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,360
阿特罗帕。

406
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,360
Atropa.

407
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,797
为什么大家都认为每家香水店都卖毒药？

407
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,797
Why does everyone think every
fragrance shop sells poisons?

408
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,000
这个确实如此。

408
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,000
This one does.

409
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,536
禁止毒药的法令是明确的。

409
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,536
The edict against
poisons is clear.

410
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,005
我必须是个傻瓜才能反对它。

410
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,005
I have to be a
fool to go against it.

411
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,673
你不是傻瓜。

411
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,673
You are no fool.

412
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:46,713
但也许你可能会对内线感兴趣。

412
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:46,713
But maybe an inside
line might interest you.

413
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,793
这条线。

413
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,793
The line.

414
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:04,396
明天押注夸梅对阵弗拉玛。

414
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:04,396
Bet on Kwame against
Flamma tomorrow.

415
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,565
这是一个愚蠢的赌注。

415
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,565
That's a fool's bet.

416
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,967
那是......

416
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,967
It was...

417
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,440
在你给我这个之前。

417
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,440
before you gave me this.

418
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:20,612
嘿 嘿！是的。

418
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:20,612
Hey, hey! Yeah.

419
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,896
弗拉玛，醒醒。

419
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,896
Flamma, wake up.

420
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:55,775
把他洗干净。

420
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:55,775
Wash him down.

421
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:59,512
我们希望他在哈迪斯之旅中保持最佳状态。

421
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:59,512
We want him to look his
best for his trip to Hades.

422
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:31,945
你不会匆匆忘记昨晚。

422
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:31,945
You won't forget
last night in a hurry.

423
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,764
我们必须走了。

423
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,764
We must go.

424
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:09,081
来，我们走吧。来。

424
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:09,081
Come, let's go. Come.

425
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,487
我让特纳克斯失望了。我必须解决这个问题。

425
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,487
I let Tenax down.
I've got to fix this.

426
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:17,389
我现在没有头脑。

426
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:17,389
I do not have a head
for this right now.

427
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,025
好吧，我会处理的。

427
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,025
All right, I'll take care of it.

428
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,061
- 我们会找到那个混蛋的。- 我们稍后再谈。

428
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,061
- We'll find that bastard.
- Let's talk about this later.

429
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:29,402
好，好。

429
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:29,402
Good, good.

430
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:34,773
装备努米底亚人。了。

430
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:34,773
Gear up the
Numidian. Time to die.

431
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:41,514
他不穿那种盔甲。

431
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:41,514
He doesn't wear
that kind of armor.

432
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:44,583
他现在这样做了，按照 Aedile Ludi 的命令。

432
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:44,583
He does now, on
order of the Aedile Ludi.

433
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:46,251
还不如把他扔给狮子。

433
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:46,251
Might as well throw
him to the lions.

434
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:48,021
你会把他钉在十字架上。

434
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:48,021
You'll crucify him.

435
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:49,588
他没有接受过这方面的训练。

435
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:49,588
He has not trained with this.

436
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:52,425
你为什么不告诉艾迪尔·鲁迪？

436
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:52,425
Why don't you tell
the Aedile Ludi that?

437
00:39:56,262 --> 00:40:00,065
如果他反抗，就把他砍在人群看不见的地方。

437
00:39:56,262 --> 00:40:00,065
If he resists, cut him
where the crowd can't see it.

438
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,485
- 你找到他了吗？-不。

438
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,485
- Did you find him?
- No.

439
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:22,755
一个浑身伤痕累累的熊那么大、丑陋的男人怎么会消失呢？

439
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:22,755
How can a big, ugly man the size of a
bear with scars all over just disappear?

440
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,923
我看到了这样一个人。

440
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,923
I saw such a man.

441
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,126
哪里？

441
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,126
Where?

442
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:30,896
在骨库附近的喷泉。到处都是伤疤。

442
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:30,896
At the fountain near the
ossuary. Scars everywhere.

443
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,097
跟我来。

443
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,097
Follow me.

444
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:45,945
我们向提图斯皇帝和玛西娅皇后致敬。

444
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:45,945
We hail Emperor Titus
and the Empress Marcia.

445
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:51,951
现在，我们来到我们的角斗士战斗。

445
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:51,951
Now, we come to our
gladiatorial combat.

446
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,088
再见了，我的兄弟。

446
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,088
Goodbye, my brother.

447
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:56,956
下辈子再见。

447
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:56,956
I will see you in the next life.

448
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,929
我们今天的第一场比赛......

448
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,929
Our first bout of the day...

449
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,333
请欢迎

449
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,333
Please welcome

450
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:10,302
伟大的弗拉玛。

450
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:10,302
the great Flamma.

451
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:14,507
弗拉玛！弗拉玛！弗拉玛！

451
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:14,507
Flamma! Flamma! Flamma!

452
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:26,518
谁将与狮子杀手夸梅战斗。

452
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:26,518
Who will fight the
lion killer Kwame.

453
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,490
万岁皇帝。

453
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,490
Hail Emperor.

454
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:35,061
我们，即将死去的人......

454
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:35,061
We, who are about to die...

455
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:37,563
向你致敬！

455
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:37,563
Salute you!

456
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:00,286
啊，来吧。

456
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:00,286
Ah, come on.

457
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:05,858
角斗士，准备好了吗？

457
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:05,858
Gladiators, ready?

458
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:08,027
今天是你死的时候了。

458
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:08,027
Today is your time to die.

459
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:10,396
向我致敬。

459
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:10,396
Honoring me.

460
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:12,231
聘！

460
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:12,231
Engage!

461
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,913
战斗，夸梅。战斗！

461
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,913
Fight, Kwame. Fight!

462
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:43,228
快点,快点。

462
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:43,228
Come on, come on.

463
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:23,202
狮子杀手夸梅！狮子杀手夸梅！

463
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:23,202
Lion Killer Kwame!
Lion Killer Kwame!

464
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:49,161
弗拉玛！弗拉玛！弗拉玛！

464
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:49,161
Flamma! Flamma! Flamma!

465
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,965
杀了他！

465
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,965
Kill him!

466
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,166
杀了他，弗拉玛！

466
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,166
Kill him, Flamma!

467
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:26,032
那个的角斗士怎么了？

467
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:26,032
What is wrong with
that bloody gladiator?

468
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:31,371
夸！夸！夸！

468
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:31,371
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

469
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:56,730
他流血了。他流血了！

469
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:56,730
He bleeds. He bleeds!

470
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,413
你认为自己是神吗？

470
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,413
You think yourself a God?

471
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,291
他抓住了他。

471
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,291
He's got him.

472
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,432
在你自己的马戏团里被屠杀。

472
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,432
Butchered in your own circus.

473
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,293
向上！向上！

473
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,293
Up! Up!

474
00:46:04,063 --> 00:46:08,101
夸！夸！夸！

474
00:46:04,063 --> 00:46:08,101
Kwame! Kwame! Kwame!

475
00:46:50,076 --> 00:46:51,543
我成功了！

475
00:46:50,076 --> 00:46:51,543
I did it!

476
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:52,911
-我成功了！-你做到了！

476
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:52,911
- I did it!
- You did it!

477
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:39,351
你不能永远躲着我，昆图斯。

477
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:39,351
You can't hide from
me forever, Quintus.

478
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,617
嗯。我已经准备好听听你需要说什么。

478
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,617
Hmm. I am ready to
hear what you need to say.

479
00:49:45,184 --> 00:49:46,619
你是对的。

479
00:49:45,184 --> 00:49:46,619
You are right.

480
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:48,755
我们确实需要谈谈。

480
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:48,755
We do need to talk.

481
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,527
母亲，我对你的尊重是无与伦比的

481
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,527
Mother, my respect
for you has no equal

482
00:49:54,626 --> 00:49:55,695
我的爱人也没有。

482
00:49:54,626 --> 00:49:55,695
and neither does my love.

483
00:49:56,695 --> 00:49:57,996
但？

483
00:49:56,695 --> 00:49:57,996
But?

484
00:49:58,097 --> 00:49:59,431
但我不会回去。

484
00:49:58,097 --> 00:49:59,431
But I will not go back.

485
00:49:59,965 --> 00:50:01,534
那不是你的决定

485
00:49:59,965 --> 00:50:01,534
That is not your decision

486
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:03,103
- 制作。- 但事实确实如此。

486
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:03,103
- to make.
- But it is.

487
00:50:04,603 --> 00:50:06,606
除非你把我绑起来，把我拖回家，

487
00:50:04,603 --> 00:50:06,606
Unless you bind me
and drag me home,

488
00:50:06,706 --> 00:50:08,407
没有办法强迫我。

488
00:50:06,706 --> 00:50:08,407
there is no way to force me.

489
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,711
你就像你的父亲一样。

489
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,711
You are just like your father.

490
00:50:12,811 --> 00:50:13,811
夸梅也是。

490
00:50:12,811 --> 00:50:13,811
Kwame, too.

491
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:16,115
还有朱拉......

491
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:16,115
And Jula...

492
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:18,851
我不知道朱拉是什么样的人。

492
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:18,851
I don't know who Jula is like.

493
00:50:18,952 --> 00:50:20,420
朱拉就像朱拉。

493
00:50:18,952 --> 00:50:20,420
Jula is like Jula.

494
00:50:23,456 --> 00:50:26,525
父亲比你更了解我。

494
00:50:23,456 --> 00:50:26,525
Father knew me
even better than you.

495
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,697
他曾经说过，鸟儿必须跟着羊群走。

495
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,697
He used to say birds
must follow their flock.

496
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:35,101
但是狮子，他找到了自己的道路。

496
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:35,101
But the lion, he
finds his own path.

497
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:37,603
- 但你是女人。-你也是。

497
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:37,603
- But you're a woman.
- So are you.

498
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:42,141
你找到了自己的路。现在我选择我的。

498
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:42,141
You found your path.
Now I am choosing mine.

499
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:50,516
-你去哪儿？- 去见朋友。

499
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:50,516
- Where are you going?
- To meet a friend.

500
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:52,485
在这个时候？谁？

500
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:52,485
At this hour? Who?

501
00:50:52,585 --> 00:50:54,688
我选择不回答的问题。

501
00:50:52,585 --> 00:50:54,688
A question I choose
not to answer.

502
00:51:42,668 --> 00:51:44,170
我们关门了。

502
00:51:42,668 --> 00:51:44,170
We're closed.

503
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:47,706
我说我们关门了。

503
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:47,706
I said we're closed.

504
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:53,612
他在哪？

504
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:53,612
Where is he?

505
00:51:55,681 --> 00:51:56,882
我去了他家。

505
00:51:55,681 --> 00:51:56,882
I went to his home.

506
00:51:58,318 --> 00:51:59,853
他不在那里。

506
00:51:58,318 --> 00:51:59,853
He wasn't there.

507
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:03,623
我给他留了一份礼物。

507
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:03,623
I left him a present.

508
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,693
我在这里等他。

508
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,693
I'll wait for him here.

509
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:09,929
但首先......

509
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:09,929
But first...

510
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:58,677
这可能比我想象的更有趣。

510
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:58,677
This might be more
fun than I thought.

511
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:10,623
你打算怎么处理？

511
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:10,623
What are you gonna do with that?

512
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:13,693
出去！你这个混蛋！

512
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:13,693
Get out! You fucker!

513
00:53:26,905 --> 00:53:28,574
帮助！

513
00:53:26,905 --> 00:53:28,574
Help!

514
00:53:29,675 --> 00:53:31,710
慢慢死去。

514
00:53:29,675 --> 00:53:31,710
Die slowly.

515
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:00,273
从哪里开始？

515
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:00,273
Where to start?

516
00:54:03,242 --> 00:54:04,811
胸部？

516
00:54:03,242 --> 00:54:04,811
The chest?

517
00:54:07,146 --> 00:54:09,748
你的胃呢？

517
00:54:07,146 --> 00:54:09,748
What about your stomach?

518
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:14,753
或者眼睛呢？

518
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:14,753
Or what about an eye?

519
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:17,657
是的。

519
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:17,657
Yes.

520
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,393
眼睛可能很好。

520
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,393
An eye might be good.

521
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:25,030
一只眼睛...

521
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:25,030
An eye...

522
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,568
为了一双眼睛。

522
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,568
for an eye.

523
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:12,012
我们回家吧。

523
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:12,012
Let's go home.
