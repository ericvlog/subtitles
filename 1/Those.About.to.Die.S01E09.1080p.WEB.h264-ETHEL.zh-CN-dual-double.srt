1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,841
以前在那些即将死去的人身上......

1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,841
Previously on
Those About to Die...

2
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:11,144
并非所有的犹太人都对他们的女王的想法感到满意

2
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:11,144
Not all the Judeans are comfortable
with the idea of their queen

3
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:12,711
为你哥哥张开双腿。

3
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:12,711
spreading her legs
for your brother.

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:16,115
我相信你的兄弟图密善要为粮食延误负责。

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:16,115
I believe your brother Domitian
is responsible for the grain delays.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,583
还有食物骚乱。

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,583
And the food riots.

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,829
- 你有证据吗？- 其中一艘运粮船上的领航员

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,829
- Do you have proof?
- A navigator on one of the grain ships

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,588
在我们说话的时候，正在被护送到这里。

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,588
is being escorted
here as we speak.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,422
这一刻即将到来。

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,422
The moment is upon us.

9
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:24,390
我们杀了我的兄弟。

9
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:24,390
We kill my brother.

10
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:25,864
我们可以在禁卫军中买到谁？

10
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:25,864
Who among the
Praetorians can we buy?

11
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:31,330
一千万塞斯特斯的黄金，两天后，在这个地方。

11
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:31,330
Ten million sesterces in gold, two
days from now, here in this place.

12
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,167
天蝎座，我会在赛道上面对他，

12
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,167
Scorpus, I will face
him on the track,

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,734
我要打败他。

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,734
and I will defeat him.

14
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,102
我们需要说话。

14
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,102
We need to speak.

15
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,572
离开我们。

15
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,572
Leave us.

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,611
马尼利乌斯要求 1000 万塞斯特斯。

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,611
Manilius demands
10 million sesterces.

17
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:21,581
是的。等我当了皇帝，我可以付钱给他。

17
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:21,581
Yes. After I'm emperor,
I can pay him that.

18
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:23,817
不然我就杀了他。

18
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:23,817
Or I'll kill him.

19
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,885
他现在想要它，提前。

19
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,885
He wants it now, in advance.

20
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,219
这不可能。

20
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,219
It's impossible.

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,555
没有我们的奖金，就没有办法。

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,555
Without our winnings,
there is no way.

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,361
更糟糕的是，莱托会见了提图斯

22
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,361
What's worse,
Leto met with Titus

23
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,230
并以惊人的准确性列出了我所做的事情。

23
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,230
and laid out, with surprising
accuracy, what I had done.

24
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,501
- 提图斯知道吗？- 是的，也不是。

24
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,501
- Titus knows?
- Yes and no.

25
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:44,603
他不知道该相信谁，是我还是莱托。

25
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:44,603
He doesn't know who
to believe, me or Leto.

26
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:52,277
-京？- 也许有办法。

26
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:52,277
- Ten million?
- Perhaps there is a way.

27
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,612
一个赌注。

27
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,612
A bet.

28
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:57,850
今天，我们把我们所拥有的一切都押在一轮赌注上。

28
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:57,850
We wager everything we
have on a round bet, today.

29
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,753
天蝎座在第七圈取得领先。

29
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,753
Scorpus to take the
lead on the seventh lap.

30
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,655
- 我会确保它发生。- 我们不要抓住稻草。

30
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,655
- I'll make sure it happens.
- Let's not grasp at straws.

31
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,257
这就是我们所拥有的。

31
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,257
That's all we have.

32
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,762
如果我们赢了，我们将有足够的钱支付马尼利乌斯

32
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,762
If we win, we'll have
enough to pay Manilius

33
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,698
以及我们需要的尽可能多的禁卫军。

33
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,698
and as many of the
Praetorian Guards as we need.

34
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:15,168
是的。让我们开始吧。

34
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:15,168
Yes, yes. Let's do it.

35
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,656
哥哥

35
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,656
Brother,

36
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,925
你看起来很激动。

36
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,925
you seem agitated.

37
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:41,561
不，只是深思熟虑。

37
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:41,561
No, just thoughtful.

38
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:42,961
尽管我对这一切感到兴奋，

38
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:42,961
As much as I
thrill at all of this,

39
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,230
两天后，我们将开放圆形剧场，

39
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,230
in two days we open
our amphitheater,

40
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:47,533
这个地方失去了一些神奇的东西。

40
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:47,533
and this place loses
something that's magic.

41
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,701
这是真的。

41
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,701
That's true enough.

42
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,905
但正如你所指出的，它也放松了束缚

42
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,905
But as you pointed out, it
also loosens the stranglehold

43
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,807
贵族控制着我们的城市。

43
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,807
the Patricians
have over our city.

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,376
- 说得好。- 这是你的话。

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,376
- Well put.
- It's your words.

45
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,378
我知道。

45
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,378
I know.

46
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,496
埃利亚。让我们来谈谈这个问题。

46
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,496
Elia. Let's talk this through.

47
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,474
我们正在做一个非常大的回合赌注。

47
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,474
We're making a
very large round bet.

48
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,908
把它摊开到其他板上，

48
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,908
Spread it out to
the other boards,

49
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,012
但要保持安静，这样我们就不会放弃我们的赔率。

49
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,012
but keep it quiet so
we don't drop our odds.

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,781
你说“我们”？这是否意味着我分一杯羹？

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,781
You said "we"? Does that
mean I have a piece of it?

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,784
做到这一点，你会得到十分之一。

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,784
Make this happen,
and you get a tenth.

52
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,489
天蝎座将在第七场比赛中领先。

52
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,489
Scorpus will take the
lead in the seventh.

53
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,524
我需要去确保这将会发生，

53
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,524
I need to go and make
sure that's what will happen,

54
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,593
并得到最后的珠宝和契约。

54
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,593
and get the last of the
jewelry and the deeds.

55
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,795
把所有赌注都押在一场比赛上是有风险的。

55
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,795
Betting everything
on one race is risky.

56
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,663
别无选择。

56
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,663
No other choice.

57
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,433
生死攸关。

57
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,433
Life or death.

58
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,569
要么全有，要么全无。

58
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,569
All or nothing.

59
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,412
它是天蝎座。

59
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,412
It is Scorpus.

60
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:10,316
我需要你做点什么。

60
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:10,316
I need something from you.

61
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,318
每个人都想从天蝎座那里得到一些东西。

61
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,318
Everyone wants
something from Scorpus.

62
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,055
我今天把我所拥有的一切都放在你身上。

62
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,055
I'm putting everything
I have on you today.

63
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,656
-万事。-哼。

63
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,656
- Everything.
- Huh.

64
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,060
当然，天蝎座会赢，但是......

64
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,060
Of course, Scorpus
will win, but...

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,562
这是意料之中的。机会不会那么好。

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,562
That's expected. The
odds won't be so good.

66
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,064
徒劳无功。

66
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,064
Vain fuck.

67
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,365
你去哪了？

67
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,365
Where have you been?

68
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,934
你获胜的几率不像以前那么好了。

68
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,934
The odds on you winning
aren't as good as they used to be.

69
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,437
- 我们下注的是一轮。 - 一轮修复？

69
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,437
- We're on a round bet.
- A round fix?

70
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,807
这么接近比赛？不。

70
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,807
This close to the race? No.

71
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,341
不，这是不可能的。

71
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,341
No, it's impossible.

72
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,345
设置太难了。要带进来的司机太多了，才能让它看起来很真实。

72
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,345
It's too hard to set up. Too many
drivers to bring in to make it look real.

73
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,112
我不在乎！

73
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,112
I don't care!

74
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,550
我需要你在第七天带头。

74
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,550
I need you to take the
lead on the seventh.

75
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,584
握住它并获胜。

75
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,584
Hold it and win.

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,454
我的作品是什么？

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,454
What's my piece?

77
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,560
你的生活。

77
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,560
Your life.

78
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,598
没有这个，图密善就死了，我们也死了。

78
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,598
Without this, Domitian's
dead, and so are we.

79
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,699
明白了？

79
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,699
Got it?

80
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,715
去其他博彩酒馆下注。

80
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,715
Go to the other betting
taverns and bet it all.

81
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,884
黄金，我的财产契约，一切。

81
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,884
Gold, the deeds to my
properties, everything.

82
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,487
你把小屁孩藏在哪里？

82
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,487
Where do you hide the chits?

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,656
-是否确定？-抓住他们。

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,656
- Are you sure?
- Get them.

84
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,538
在努米底亚，豹子将猎物拖到树上。

84
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,538
In Numidia, leopards
drag their prey up into trees.

85
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,709
较高的地方更适合隐藏有价值的东西。

85
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,709
Higher places are better
for hiding things of value.

86
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,579
去。

86
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,579
Go.

87
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,581
我需要帮助。

87
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,581
I need help.

88
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,949
鲁弗斯，过来。

88
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,949
Rufus, come here.

89
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,918
拿着这些，跟从我。

89
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,918
Take these, and follow me.

90
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:48,067
较高的地方更适合隐藏有价值的东西。

90
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:48,067
Higher places are better
for hiding things of value.

91
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:12,257
- 氙气死了。- 是的，这样的悲剧。

91
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:12,257
- Xenon died.
- Yes, such a tragedy.

92
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,062
所以我想，“为什么不选择黄金呢？

92
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,062
So I thought, "Why
not go with Gold?"

93
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:18,831
好决定。

93
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:18,831
Good decision.

94
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:23,903
奥托，在那边。

94
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:23,903
Otho, over there.

95
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:29,875
方索亚在第一场比赛中？

95
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:29,875
Fonsoa is in the first race?

96
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,043
是的，他是。

96
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,043
Yes, he is.

97
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,852
现在你明白了吗，小兄弟？这个的吸引力。

97
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,852
Now do you see, little
brother? The appeal of this.

98
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:40,854
加油。

98
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:40,854
Come on.

99
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,923
你一定感觉到是什么吸引了安德里亚和我。

99
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,923
You must feel what
lured Andria and I to this.,

100
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,605
罗马市民，

100
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,605
Citizens of Rome,

101
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,311
我向你们介绍今天的第一场比赛！

101
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,311
I present to you the
first race of today!

102
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:52,859
后座！准备！

102
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:52,859
Pillions! Ready!

103
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,184
嗨！

103
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,184
Hiya!

104
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,894
嗨！

104
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,894
Hiya!

105
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:46,245
嘿，奥托，你想吃点东西吗？你饿了吗？

105
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:46,245
Hey, Otho, would you like
some food? Are you hungry?

106
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,085
快点！跑！

106
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,085
Move it! Run!

107
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:29,154
开门。埃利亚，拜托了。请打开。

107
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:29,154
Open up. Elia, please.
Please open up.

108
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:31,357
搬过来。

108
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:31,357
Move over.

109
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,802
不！方索阿！

109
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,802
No! Fonsoa!

110
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,774
方索阿！

110
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,774
Fonsoa!

111
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,453
奥托，过来。

111
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,453
Otho, come.

112
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,907
去看医生。快 点。

112
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,907
Get the physician. Hurry.

113
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,909
腿。

113
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,909
The legs.

114
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,332
不要放弃。请。

114
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,332
Don't give up. Please.

115
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,900
一切都会好起来的。

115
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,900
It'll be all right.

116
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,572
请和我在一起，拜托。

116
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,572
Please stay with me, please.

117
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,311
埃利亚。

117
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,311
Elia.

118
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,027
你还记得我摔断腿的时候吗？

118
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,027
Do you remember
when I broke my leg?

119
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,130
答案是肯定的。傻事。

119
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,130
Of course. Foolish thing.

120
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,234
你把我带回家。

120
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,234
You carried me home.

121
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,168
爷爷，他走了。

121
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,168
Grandfather, he was gone.

122
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,374
你抱着我，而安德里亚把我的腿放在一边。

122
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,374
You held me while
Andria set my leg.

123
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,009
当我哭泣时，你整夜抱着我。

123
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,009
You held me all
night long while I cried.

124
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,914
它一定很痛。

124
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,914
It must have hurt.

125
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,153
不是这样的。

125
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,153
Not like this.

126
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,094
对不起。

126
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,094
I'm sorry.

127
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,044
不！

127
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,044
No!

128
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,213
不！

128
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,213
No!

129
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,384
不。

129
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,384
No.

130
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,600
嘿。天蝎座死了。

130
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,600
Hey. Scorpus is dead.

131
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,447
天蝎座死了！

131
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,447
Scorpus is dead!

132
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,341
我下令将斯科普斯关押在这里。

132
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,341
I ordered Scorpus' internment
to be here at the spint.

133
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,113
我本来会为他委托建造一座宏伟的雕像，但是......

133
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,113
I would have commissioned
a grand statue for him, but...

134
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,149
在我看到它之前，我就已经死了。

134
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,149
I'll be dead
before I can see it.

135
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,719
他是我的朋友。

135
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,719
He was my friend.

136
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,590
我会委托雕像。

136
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,590
I'll commission the statue.

137
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,525
你也会死的。

137
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,525
You'll be dead, too.

138
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,230
我们打赌，我们输了。

138
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,230
We bet, and we lost.

139
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,298
现在，很快我们就死了。

139
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,298
Now, soon we die.

140
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,568
也许不会那么快。

140
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,568
Perhaps not so soon.

141
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,472
我们打赌，我们输了，

141
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,472
We bet, we lost,

142
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,243
但我找到了我们的奖金。

142
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,243
but I found our winnings.

143
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,479
覆盖马尼利乌斯绰绰有余。

143
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,479
And it's more than
enough to cover Manilius.

144
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
什么？

144
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
What?

145
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,583
如何？

145
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,583
How?

146
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,617
这有关系吗？

146
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,617
Does it matter?

147
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,653
不。

147
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,653
No.

148
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,690
现在我们也有天蝎座的份额。

148
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,690
And now we have
Scorpus' share as well.

149
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,791
我想我们会的。

149
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,791
I suppose we do.

150
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,579
从这里可以欣赏到更好的景色。

150
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,579
A much better view from here.

151
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,782
谁会想到几步就能产生如此大的差异？

151
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,782
Who would have thought a couple of
paces would make such a difference?

152
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:08,188
站在这里的壮丽景色是您的合作伙伴，而不仅仅是客户。

152
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:08,188
A grand view standing here as
your partner and not just a client.

153
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,455
我的，我的。

153
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,455
My, my.

154
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,826
我们雄心勃勃，不是吗？

154
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,826
We are ambitious, aren't we?

155
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,227
是的，我们是。

155
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,227
Yes, we are.

156
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,730
而你，甚至不是贵族。

156
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,730
And you, not even a Patrician.

157
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,667
不要太确定。

157
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,667
Don't be so sure about that.

158
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:25,739
如果是这样，我最好有你做我的仆人。

158
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:25,739
If so, all the better for me
to have you as my servant.

159
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,279
对不起。

159
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,279
Excuse me.

160
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,750
我有一个再见要处理。

160
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,750
I have a goodbye to attend to.

161
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,705
大家都出去。

161
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,705
Everybody out.

162
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,358
可惜你现在会错过所有的乐趣。

162
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,358
Shame you'll miss
all the fun now.

163
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,798
没有你，就不会有那么多的笑声。

163
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,798
There won't be as much
of a laugh without you.

164
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,714
飞驰穿过冥河，享受极乐世界的美酒之旅......

164
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,714
Speed across the River Styx to the
wine-soaked pleasures of Elysium...

165
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:48,587
你这个了不起的醉汉混蛋。

165
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:48,587
you wonderful, drunken bastard.

166
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:03,028
如果不是我的愤怒，就没有坟墓可以挖了。

166
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:03,028
Were it not for my rage,
there would be no grave to dig.

167
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,497
归咎于命运。

167
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,497
Blame the Fates.

168
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,598
不是你自己。

168
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,598
Not yourself.

169
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,919
萨琳娜，我必须来。

169
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,919
Salena, I had to come.

170
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,422
多么可怕的悲剧。

170
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,422
What a terrible tragedy.

171
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,625
请允许我弥补。

171
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,625
Please, allow me to make amends.

172
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:22,575
睡吧。

172
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:22,575
Go to sleep.

173
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:28,181
我为我的触摸道歉。

173
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:28,181
I apologize for my touch.

174
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,083
你能让我重新开始吗？

174
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,083
Will you let me begin again?

175
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,018
说出你必须说的话，然后离开。

175
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,018
Say what you must, then leave.

176
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:36,021
没有义务，我要求你与我的辩护人会面。

176
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:36,021
Without obligation, I ask that
you meet with my advocate.

177
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:40,460
他相信你有充分的理由拿回你在蓝派的股份。

177
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:40,460
He believes you have a strong case to
get back your shares in the Blue Faction.

178
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,130
继续。

178
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,130
Go on.

179
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,833
我相信你已经生了三个孩子。

179
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,833
You have had three
children, I believe.

180
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,800
只有奥托活着。

180
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,800
Only Otho lives.

181
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,444
另外两个还很年轻，当他们......

181
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,444
The other two are
very young, when they...

182
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,904
然后适用 jus trium liberorum。

182
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,904
Then the jus trium
liberorum applies.

183
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,875
当一个女人生了三个孩子时，她是自由的

183
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,875
When a woman has had
three children, she is free

184
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:57,777
来自她丈夫的监护权。

184
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:57,777
from the guardianship
of her husband.

185
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,980
-意义？- 你的就是你的。

185
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,980
- Meaning?
- What is yours is yours.

186
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,215
那些股份是你的，不是你丈夫的。

186
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,215
Those shares were
yours, not your husband's.

187
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,384
他从你那里偷走了它们，

187
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,384
He stole them from you,

188
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,453
因此，将它们出售给马苏斯领事是无效的。

188
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,453
and so the sale of them to
Consul Marsus was invalid.

189
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,721
这是无法证明的。

189
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,721
This can't be proven.

190
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,123
它已经得到证明。

190
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,123
It is already proven.

191
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,092
它只需要在法庭上争论。

191
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,092
It needs only to
be argued in court.

192
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,761
这是一个昂贵但可行的过程。

192
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,761
An expensive, but
doable process.

193
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,633
我们多久可以与您的倡导者会面？

193
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,633
How soon can we meet
with your advocate?

194
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,184
一个傻瓜的赌注，你输了。

194
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,184
A fool's bet, and you lost.

195
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:40,586
我失去了一个，

195
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:40,586
I lost one,

196
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,654
并赢得了另一个。

196
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,654
and won another.

197
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,724
我们埋葬死者，勇往直前。

197
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,724
We bury the dead
and forge ahead.

198
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,827
为我写这些。

198
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,827
Write these for me.

199
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,763
两个卷轴将是相同的。

199
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,763
Both scrolls will be the same.

200
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,001
我可以相信你吗？

200
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,001
Can I trust you?

201
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:59,838
是的，也不是。

201
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:59,838
Yes and no.

202
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,941
这与你的孩子无关。

202
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,941
This has nothing to
do with your children.

203
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,949
好。现在写。

203
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,949
Good. Now write.

204
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:25,865
- 数一数。- 都排序好了？

204
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:25,865
- Count it.
- All sorted?

205
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,634
提多将在睡梦中死去。

205
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,634
Titus will die in his sleep.

206
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,103
- 波尔图呢？- 他很快就会死去。

206
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,103
- And Porto?
- He will die shortly after.

207
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,838
以及那些忠于他的禁卫军。

207
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,838
Along with those
Praetorians loyal to him.

208
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:36,608
我在奥斯蒂亚有人监视导航员的到来。

208
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:36,608
I have people in Ostia monitoring
the arrival of the navigator.

209
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,211
无论你做什么，都要快点。

209
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,211
Whatever you do, do it fast.

210
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:43,750
作为交易的一部分，

210
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:43,750
As part of the deal,

211
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:46,819
我已经写了双重忏悔。

211
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:46,819
I've written out
dual confessions.

212
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,691
如果我们中的任何一个背叛了另一个，我们都会死。

212
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,691
If either of us betray
the other, we both die.

213
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,159
还有图密善和我们在一起。

213
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,159
And Domitian with us.

214
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:58,565
两张简单的羊皮纸，任何一张都足以让我们被杀，

214
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:58,565
Two simple parchments, either
one enough to see us killed,

215
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,700
任何一个都足以让我们活着。

215
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,700
either one enough
to keep us alive.

216
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,006
取决于谁持有它们。

216
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,006
Depending on who holds them.

217
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,367
大功告成。

217
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,367
It's done.

218
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:37,037
而现在，只要你活着，

218
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:37,037
And now, for as
long as you live,

219
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,140
你的头上悬着一把剑。

219
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,140
you have a sword
dangling over your head.

220
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:43,108
- 就像那个传说中的希腊人一样。-达摩克利斯？

220
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:43,108
- Like that legendary Greek.
- Damocles?

221
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,012
跟我来。

221
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,012
Follow me.

222
00:25:49,082 --> 00:25:52,251
我们都生活在一把悬在头上的剑上，卡拉。

222
00:25:49,082 --> 00:25:52,251
We all live with a sword
dangling over our heads, Cala.

223
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,988
只是我知道。

223
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,988
It's just that I know it.

224
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,996
推到这里。

224
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,996
Push here.

225
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,748
你疯了。

225
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,748
You're mad.

226
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,050
你现在也身处其中。

226
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,050
You're in this, too, now.

227
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,021
然后我们俩都疯了。

227
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,021
Then we are both mad.

228
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,005
拜托，我求求你了。

228
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,005
Please, I beg you.

229
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,140
我有重要的信息要告诉皇帝。

229
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,140
I have important
information for the emperor.

230
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:49,409
他会付给你比你想象的更多的钱

230
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:49,409
He will pay you more
than you can imagine

231
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,044
当他听到我要说的话时。

231
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,044
when he hears
what I have to say.

232
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:05,191
你到底想告诉我哥哥什么？

232
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:05,191
And what precisely do
you want to tell my brother?

233
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,796
求求你了，我的爱人。

233
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,796
Please, I beg you, my love.

234
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,932
那你为什么不求我呢？

234
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,932
Then why don't you beg for me?

235
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,142
在众神的见证下，

235
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,142
By all the gods,

236
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:26,712
我后悔我做了什么，我再也不会这样做了。

236
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:26,712
I regret what I've done, and
I will never, ever do it again.

237
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,181
我永远不会谈论它。

237
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,181
I will never speak of it.

238
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:32,218
不。

238
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:32,218
No.

239
00:27:33,286 --> 00:27:34,453
你不会。

239
00:27:33,286 --> 00:27:34,453
You won't.

240
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,355
你已经知道太多了。

240
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,355
You already know too much.

241
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,192
我不能让你把秘密泄露给我哥哥。

241
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,192
I can't have you spilling
secrets to my brother.

242
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,260
不，请不要。不要！

242
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,260
No, please, don't. Don't!

243
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,038
-停。-下。

243
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,038
- Stop.
- Down.

244
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,111
这是个坏消息。

244
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,111
It's bad news.

245
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:33,313
图密善正在收购禁卫军。

245
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:33,313
Domitian is buying
Praetorian Guards.

246
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,915
他是黄金派系的部分所有者。

246
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,915
He's part owner
of the Gold Faction.

247
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,019
这就是他得到所有钱的地方。

247
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,019
That's where he's
getting all his money.

248
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:41,554
告诉我你有证据。

248
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:41,554
Tell me you have proof.

249
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:45,325
- 只有我听到的。- 那么谁能确定呢？

249
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:45,325
- Only what I've heard.
- Then who would know for certain?

250
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,094
卡拉经营着他的书。

250
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,094
Cala runs his books.

251
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:52,065
我相信她最小的女儿在马苏斯领事的家里当奴隶。

251
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:52,065
I believe her youngest daughter is in
the home of the Consul Marsus as a slave.

252
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,299
是的。

252
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,299
Yeah.

253
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,473
向上。

253
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,473
Up.

254
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:31,104
我是来看你的情妇的。

254
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:31,104
I'm here to see your mistress.

255
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,211
殿下。

255
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,211
Your Highness.

256
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,983
我们有同样的敌人，安东尼娅。

256
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,983
We have the same enemy, Antonia.

257
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:47,220
那会是谁呢？

257
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:47,220
And who might that be?

258
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,521
你非常清楚它是谁。

258
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,521
You know perfectly
well who it is.

259
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:52,551
你被马尔苏斯领事的妻子安东尼娅·科内利亚召见。

259
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:52,551
You are summoned by Antonia
Cornelia, wife of the Consul Marsus.

260
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:53,586
我？

260
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:53,586
Me?

261
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,655
为什么？

261
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,655
For what?

262
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,357
安东尼娅夫人想和你说话

262
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,357
The Lady Antonia
wishes to speak to you

263
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:01,594
关于你的女儿朱拉，她是她家的奴隶。

263
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:01,594
about your daughter Jula,
who's a slave in her house.

264
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,491
记住，不要太快。

264
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,491
Remember, not too quick.

265
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:35,461
在你把它交给他们之前，让人群等待它。

265
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:35,461
Let the crowd wait for it
before you give it to them.

266
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,467
我想你可能终于找到了自己的使命。

266
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,467
I think you may have
finally found your calling.

267
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,569
血腥运动，表演者，

267
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,569
Blood sports, showman,

268
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:45,105
它适合你。

268
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:45,105
it suits you.

269
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,575
我在远处的座位上坐了足够长的时间

269
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,575
I spent long enough
sitting in the far seats

270
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:49,688
知道暴徒想要什么。

270
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:49,688
to know what the mob wants.

271
00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:18,672
我的女士们。

271
00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:18,672
My ladies.

272
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,711
你想和我谈谈我的女儿吗？

272
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,711
You wish to speak to
me about my daughter?

273
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:30,650
我有机会买到她的自由吗？

273
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:30,650
Is there a chance I
might buy her freedom?

274
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:32,285
你误会了。

274
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:32,285
You misunderstand.

275
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:37,057
-妈妈！放手！不！- 离开她。离开她。

275
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:37,057
- Mother! Let go! No!
- Leave her. Leave her.

276
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,692
安静。

276
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,692
Quiet.

277
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:42,394
你的女儿一直在监视我和我丈夫。

277
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:42,394
Your daughter has been
spying on my husband and me.

278
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,330
这种罪行应判处死刑。

278
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,330
Such an offense warrants death.

279
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:49,035
我有权利和权力这样做

279
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:49,035
And I am within my
rights and power to do it

280
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,537
以我选择的任何方式。

280
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,537
in any manner I choose.

281
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:56,276
你为一个男人工作，Tenax。

281
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:56,276
You work for a man, Tenax.

282
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,179
你住在他的家里。

282
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,179
You reside in his home.

283
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:02,315
这个人是弗拉维乌斯·多米提亚努斯的客户，

283
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:02,315
This man is a client
of Flavius Domitianus,

284
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,250
皇帝的兄弟。

284
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,250
the brother of the emperor.

285
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:07,220
我猜你的女儿是在向他报告，

285
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:07,220
I presume your daughter
was reporting to him,

286
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,520
通过你。

286
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,520
through you.

287
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:17,463
图密善和特纳克斯负责逮捕我的丈夫马苏斯领事。

287
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:17,463
Domitian and Tenax are responsible for
the arrest of my husband, Consul Marsus.

288
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,202
你知道他们正在策划政变吗

288
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,202
Did you know they
were planning a coup

289
00:33:23,236 --> 00:33:25,337
反对提图斯皇帝？

289
00:33:23,236 --> 00:33:25,337
against the Emperor Titus?

290
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,809
我就是这么想的。

290
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,809
That's what I thought.

291
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,682
我们需要证明他们有计划的背叛。

291
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,682
We need proof of
their planned betrayal.

292
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:40,653
只有这样，你才能拯救你的女儿。

292
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:40,653
Only with that will you
save your daughter.

293
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,460
她的沉默很能说明问题。

293
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,460
Her silence speaks volumes.

294
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,695
如果有这样的证据，

294
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,695
If there is such proof,

295
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:51,765
我怎么知道你会信守诺言

295
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:51,765
how do I know you
will keep your word

296
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:54,733
不会伤害我的女儿吗？

296
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:54,733
and will not harm my daughter?

297
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:02,575
300多年来，我的家族一直为罗马提供执政官。

297
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:02,575
My family has been furnishing
Rome with consuls for over 300 years.

298
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:05,444
我在撒谎之上。

298
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:05,444
I am above lying.

299
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,747
但我理解你缺乏信任。

299
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,747
But I understand
your lack of trust.

300
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,650
不，不，不，不，不要，不要，拜托。

300
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,650
No, no, no, no,
don't, don't, please.

301
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,121
我可以给你证明。

301
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,121
I can get you your proof.

302
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,722
但不要伤害她。

302
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,722
But don't hurt her.

303
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,358
现在由你决定。

303
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,358
It is up to you now.

304
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:19,693
你要到中午。

304
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:19,693
You have until midday.

305
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,697
否则，你的女儿就会死。

305
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,697
If not, your daughter will die.

306
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:26,766
现在，走吧。

306
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:26,766
Now, go.

307
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,717
听

307
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,717
Listen,

308
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:22,355
地球上最伟大的城市的人们，

308
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:22,355
people of the
greatest city on Earth,

309
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,423
让游戏开始吧！

309
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,423
let the games begin!

310
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:32,965
振作起来，兄弟。

310
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:32,965
Brace yourself, brother.

311
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,501
你即将赢得整个罗马的崇拜。

311
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,501
You're about to win the
adoration of all of Rome.

312
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,005
我总是这样想象。

312
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,005
I always imagined it like this.

313
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,806
离得这么近，你可以看到

313
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:46,806
So close you can see

314
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,842
万事。

314
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,842
everything.

315
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:55,414
- 准备好鸟儿。- 准备好鸟儿。

315
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:55,414
- Ready the birds.
- Ready the birds.

316
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,617
- 准备好鸟儿。- 鸟儿。

316
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,617
- Ready the birds.
- The birds.

317
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:16,402
- 释放它们。- 释放它们。

317
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:16,402
- Release them.
- Release them.

318
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:17,871
释放它们。

318
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:17,871
Release them.

319
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:44,998
你已经超越了自己，兄弟。

319
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:44,998
You've outdone
yourself, brother.

320
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,632
这是一件很特别的事情。

320
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,632
This is something special.

321
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
光环。

321
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Aura.

322
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,581
光环，这是什么？

322
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,581
Aura, what is this?

323
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:44,550
- 这怎么可能？-请原谅我。

323
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:44,550
- How can this be?
- Please forgive me.

324
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,786
- 原谅你什么？- 为了一切。

324
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,786
- Forgive you for what?
- For everything.

325
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,788
我是你来到这个舞台的原因，

325
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,788
I am the reason you
are here in this arena,

326
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,789
朱拉是奴隶，我们的母亲在罗马。

326
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,789
that Jula is a slave, that
our mother is in Rome.

327
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:52,025
我是一切的根源。

327
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:52,025
I am the cause of everything.

328
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,893
- 你在保护朱拉。- 看看我们从哪里来的。

328
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,893
- You were protecting Jula.
- And look at where that got us.

329
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,967
我已经把自己卖给了卢杜斯。

329
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,967
I have sold myself to the Ludus.

330
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:05,804
你认为你的死会让我们更容易吗？

330
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:05,804
Do you think your death
will make it easier for us?

331
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:08,742
也许不适合你，

331
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:08,742
Perhaps not for you,

332
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:11,210
但对我来说。

332
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:11,210
but for me.

333
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:14,681
夸。

333
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:14,681
Kwame.

334
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:17,916
-来。-光环。

334
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:17,916
- Come.
- Aura.

335
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,028
-关门。- 你姐姐？

335
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,028
- Close the door.
- Your sister?

336
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,166
- 并拉。-拉。

336
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,166
- And pull.
- Pull.

337
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,534
拉！

337
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,534
Pull!

338
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,925
妮卡，我的女孩，仔细听。

338
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,925
Nica, my girl, listen carefully.

339
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,838
参议员。

339
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,838
Senators.

340
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:16,108
特纳克斯，解放我们。您将获得超出梦想的利润。

340
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:16,108
Tenax, free us. You'll
profit beyond your dreams.

341
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,110
领事。

341
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,110
Consul.

342
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:19,244
这太疯狂了。你知道他也会杀了你。

342
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:19,244
This is madness. You
know he'll kill you, too.

343
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:20,579
我们都会死！

343
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:20,579
We will all die!

344
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:21,914
闭嘴！

344
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:21,914
Shut up!

345
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,766
特纳克斯。

345
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,766
Tenax.

346
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,534
打开大门。

346
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,534
Open the gates.

347
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,043
你不能这么做。

347
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,043
You can't do this.

348
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:52,112
请！

348
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:52,112
Please!

349
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,813
特纳克斯！

349
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,813
Tenax!

350
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,155
看看那些贵族的婊子。

350
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,155
Look at those Patrician
sons of bitches.

351
00:42:04,824 --> 00:42:07,226
现在离 Aventine 还有很长的路要走吗？

351
00:42:04,824 --> 00:42:07,226
A long way from
the Aventine now?

352
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:16,735
认识埃及鳄鱼神索贝克

352
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:16,735
Meet Sobek, the
Egyptian crocodile god

353
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:19,204
来自尼罗河的黑暗水域。

353
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:19,204
from the dark
waters of the Nile.

354
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:22,608
后世的恶魔。

354
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:22,608
The demon of the hereafter.

355
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,068
留在这里。等等我。

355
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,068
Stay here. Wait for me.

356
00:42:57,143 --> 00:43:00,213
- 你带了吗？- 得到我的女儿。

356
00:42:57,143 --> 00:43:00,213
- Have you brought it?
- Get my daughter.

357
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:03,382
把她交给我，然后你就会得到你的证据。

357
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:03,382
Hand her over to me,
then you'll get your proof.

358
00:43:04,784 --> 00:43:06,085
去找她。

358
00:43:04,784 --> 00:43:06,085
Go get her.

359
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:15,295
-妈妈。-安静。

359
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:15,295
- Mother.
- Quiet.

360
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:18,931
尼卡。

360
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:18,931
Nica.

361
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:41,021
证明。

361
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:41,021
Proof.

362
00:43:45,391 --> 00:43:46,860
向上。向上。

362
00:43:45,391 --> 00:43:46,860
Up. Up.

363
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:49,661
你是自由的。

363
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:49,661
You're free.

364
00:44:00,106 --> 00:44:01,407
停。

364
00:44:00,106 --> 00:44:01,407
Stop.

365
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,077
这是朱拉，执政官马苏斯家的女奴吗？

365
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,077
Is this Jula, slave girl of the
House of the Consul Marsus,

366
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,079
角斗士夸梅的妹妹？

366
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,079
sister of the gladiator Kwame?

367
00:44:06,512 --> 00:44:08,313
这是关于什么的？

367
00:44:06,512 --> 00:44:08,313
What's this about?

368
00:44:08,347 --> 00:44:10,916
- 带走她。她现在是罗马的财产。-不。不，不，停下来。

368
00:44:08,347 --> 00:44:10,916
- Take her. She is now the property of Rome.
- No. No, no, stop.

369
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,452
请。这是关于什么的？

369
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,452
Please. What is this about?

370
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:16,690
妈妈！妈妈！-你要带她去哪里？请！

370
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:16,690
Mother! Mother!
-Where are you taking her? Please!

371
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:27,233
加油！

371
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:27,233
Come on!

372
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:30,903
-现在。-现在！

372
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:30,903
- Now.
- Now!

373
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:33,106
现在！

373
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:33,106
Now!

374
00:44:58,297 --> 00:45:01,501
当塞特谋杀他的兄弟奥西里斯时，

374
00:44:58,297 --> 00:45:01,501
When Seth murdered
his brother Osiris,

375
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:08,273
伊希斯派出强大的索贝克向塞特复仇。

375
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:08,273
Isis sent out the mighty Sobek
to take vengeance on Seth.

376
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:12,512
索贝克会怜悯叛徒吗？

376
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:12,512
Will Sobek show
mercy on the traitors?

377
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:14,514
或。。。

377
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:14,514
Or...

378
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:19,052
他们会报仇吗？

378
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:19,052
Will they take revenge?

379
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,588
我们确定吗？

379
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,588
Are we sure about this?

380
00:45:21,621 --> 00:45:25,190
毕竟，他是执政官，他们是参议员。

380
00:45:21,621 --> 00:45:25,190
After all, he is a consul,
and they are senators.

381
00:45:25,224 --> 00:45:28,762
更有理由公开奖励他们的背叛。

381
00:45:25,224 --> 00:45:28,762
All the more reason to
reward their betrayal publicly.

382
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:40,273
我想你是对的。

382
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:40,273
I suppose you're right.

383
00:45:56,956 --> 00:46:00,460
特纳克斯，你的手下之一，一直在监视奥斯蒂亚港

383
00:45:56,956 --> 00:46:00,460
Tenax, one of your men who's
been watching Ostia Harbor

384
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:03,362
告诉我，风平浪静带来了某位领航员

384
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:03,362
tells me that fair winds have
brought a certain navigator

385
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:05,597
比预期更早到达奥斯蒂亚。

385
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:05,597
to Ostia earlier than expected.

386
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:07,266
他将于今天下午抵达。

386
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:07,266
He is to arrive this afternoon.

387
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,878
加油！

387
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,878
Come on!

388
00:46:21,581 --> 00:46:23,483
小心！

388
00:46:21,581 --> 00:46:23,483
Look out!

389
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:48,340
那不是你的孩子吗？

389
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:48,340
Wasn't that your boy?

390
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:54,047
兄弟，你对娱乐的品味从未停止过让我感到震惊。

390
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:54,047
Your taste in entertainment
never ceases to appall me, brother.

391
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,317
让开。为安东尼娅夫人让路。

391
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,317
Make way. Make way
for the Lady Antonia.

392
00:47:02,054 --> 00:47:04,923
你，停下来。不允许女性入内。

392
00:47:02,054 --> 00:47:04,923
You, stop. No women allowed.

393
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,326
上层甲板的 22 号登机口。

393
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,326
Gate 22 for the upper deck.

394
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:10,063
我是安东尼娅·文明，马苏斯领事的妻子。让开。

394
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:10,063
I'm Antonia Civilius, the wife of
the Consul Marsus. Step aside.

395
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:12,032
- 你退到一边。- 不要碰我！

395
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:12,032
- You step aside.
- Do not touch me!

396
00:47:12,065 --> 00:47:13,233
出去。

396
00:47:12,065 --> 00:47:13,233
Get out.

397
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:16,402
现在。

397
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:16,402
Now.

398
00:47:16,436 --> 00:47:17,871
继续。你也是。

398
00:47:16,436 --> 00:47:17,871
Go on. You, too.

399
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:22,108
我是贝伦妮丝，犹太人的王后，提图斯皇帝的配偶。

399
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:22,108
I am Berenice, queen of the Judeans
and consort of the Emperor Titus.

400
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:23,242
我要求和他谈谈。

400
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:23,242
I demand to speak to him.

401
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,010
今天是什么？

401
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,010
What is it today?

402
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:26,088
- 我是女王... - 她在那里。

402
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:26,088
- I am queen...
- There she is.

403
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:28,914
我们不会再有机会杀死这个妓女了。

403
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:28,914
We won't get another
chance to kill this whore.

404
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,349
现在，不要失去她。

404
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,349
Now, don't lose her.

405
00:47:30,382 --> 00:47:33,186
我有一件最重要的事情要送给提图斯皇帝。

405
00:47:30,382 --> 00:47:33,186
I have something of the utmost
importance to give to the Emperor Titus.

406
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:35,288
我要求和他说话！

406
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:35,288
I demand to speak to him!

407
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,023
- 压低声音。- 现在放开我，

407
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,023
- Keep your voice down.
- Let go of me now,

408
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:38,992
不然我就把你禀报给皇帝。

408
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:38,992
or I'll report you
to the emperor.

409
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:40,460
他会听到这个。

409
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:40,460
He will hear of this.

410
00:47:40,492 --> 00:47:44,998
你会因为给他而得到奖励，如果你不这样做，你会受到惩罚。

410
00:47:40,492 --> 00:47:44,998
You will be rewarded for giving it
to him or be punished if you don't.

411
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,199
你不明白吗？

411
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,199
Don't you understand?

412
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:48,233
对，给我就行了。

412
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:48,233
Right, just give it to me.

413
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,969
把你所拥有的给我，我会亲自带给他。

413
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,969
Give me what you have
and I'll take it to him myself.

414
00:47:51,003 --> 00:47:52,706
不。从我的手到他的手。

414
00:47:51,003 --> 00:47:52,706
No. From my hand to his.

415
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:55,074
要么就是这样，要么什么都没有。

415
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:55,074
It's either that, or nothing.

416
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:57,077
好吧，那就没什么了。

416
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:57,077
Well, then it's nothing.

417
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,677
你会为你的傲慢而死。

417
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,677
And you will die
for your insolence.

418
00:48:00,746 --> 00:48:03,182
- 罗马低能儿！- 野蛮妓女！

418
00:48:00,746 --> 00:48:03,182
- Roman imbeciles!
- Barbarian whore!

419
00:49:29,268 --> 00:49:31,036
女性的上层甲板在哪里？

419
00:49:29,268 --> 00:49:31,036
Where's the upper
deck for women?

420
00:49:37,677 --> 00:49:39,512
给他拿点东西喝。

420
00:49:37,677 --> 00:49:39,512
Fetch him something to drink.

421
00:50:00,632 --> 00:50:03,402
我需要和图密善殿下谈谈，这很紧急。

421
00:50:00,632 --> 00:50:03,402
I need to speak with His
Highness Domitian, it's urgent.

422
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,476
回来。

422
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,476
Get back.

423
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,177
返回。

423
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,177
Back.

424
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,786
Tenax 需要和你说话。

424
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,786
Tenax needs to speak to you.

425
00:50:30,396 --> 00:50:31,664
等一下，兄弟。

425
00:50:30,396 --> 00:50:31,664
A moment, brother.

426
00:50:31,697 --> 00:50:33,065
是的，很好。

426
00:50:31,697 --> 00:50:33,065
Yes, very well.

427
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:43,576
我们没时间了。

427
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:43,576
We're out of time.

428
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,880
领航员今天下午抵达奥斯蒂亚。

428
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,880
The navigator arrives
in Ostia this afternoon.

429
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,514
所以，一切都结束了。

429
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,514
So, it's over.

430
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:50,315
提多赢了，我们死了。

430
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:50,315
Titus wins and we die.

431
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:51,784
不。

431
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:51,784
No.

432
00:50:51,818 --> 00:50:54,219
如果我们推进我们的计划，就不会。

432
00:50:51,818 --> 00:50:54,219
Not if we move
our plans forward.

433
00:50:54,253 --> 00:50:56,255
此时此地杀了他。

433
00:50:54,253 --> 00:50:56,255
Kill him here and now.

434
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:58,123
什么？你疯了吗？

434
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:58,123
What? Are you mad?

435
00:50:58,157 --> 00:50:59,835
- 我们有什么选择？- 你不能杀他

435
00:50:58,157 --> 00:50:59,835
- What choice do we have?
- You cannot kill him

436
00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:01,661
在整个罗马面前。

436
00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:01,661
in front of all of Rome.

437
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:09,436
把提图斯从椅子上弄起来，走到前厅。

437
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:09,436
Get Titus out of his chair
and up into the anteroom.

438
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:11,204
剩下的就交给我吧。

438
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:11,204
I'll do the rest.

439
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:12,505
他的警卫呢？

439
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:12,505
What about his guards?

440
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:14,740
一旦他死了，他们就会看着你。

440
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:14,740
Once he's dead,
they will look to you.

441
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:16,543
他们的新皇帝。

441
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:16,543
Their new emperor.

442
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:22,548
尽快负责，阻止他们杀我。

442
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:22,548
Take charge as quickly as you
can to stop them from killing me.

443
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:25,318
如果情况很糟糕，我对此一无所知。

443
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:25,318
If this goes badly,
I knew nothing of it.

444
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:27,119
答案是肯定的。去。

444
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:27,119
Of course. Go.

445
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:48,208
我们需要说话。

445
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:48,208
We need to speak.

446
00:51:48,742 --> 00:51:49,742
独自。

446
00:51:48,742 --> 00:51:49,742
Alone.

447
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:54,481
很好。

447
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:54,481
Very well.

448
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,235
皇帝。

448
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,235
Emperor.

449
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:21,340
波尔图。我和我哥哥，我们只是......

449
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:21,340
Porto. Me and my
brother, we were just...

450
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:23,876
这是最重要的。

450
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:23,876
It is of the utmost importance.

451
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:27,313
很好。

451
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:27,313
Very well.

452
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,548
等一下，兄弟。

452
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,548
One moment, brother.

453
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:02,382
谷物船队导航员在奥斯蒂亚。

453
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:02,382
The grain fleet
navigator is in Ostia.

454
00:53:02,414 --> 00:53:04,550
他有一艘船的日志证明。

454
00:53:02,414 --> 00:53:04,550
He has a ship's log proof.

455
00:53:08,954 --> 00:53:11,891
证明你哥哥耽误了粮食发货。

455
00:53:08,954 --> 00:53:11,891
Proof that your brother
delayed the grain shipments.

456
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:23,635
把他带到我这里来。

456
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:23,635
Bring him to me.

457
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,940
我认为我们自己去奥斯蒂亚更安全。

457
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,940
I think it's safer that we
go to Ostia ourselves.

458
00:53:26,972 --> 00:53:28,942
难道你不相信你的手下会把他带到这里来吗？

458
00:53:26,972 --> 00:53:28,942
Do you not trust your
men to bring him here?

459
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:30,976
我现在不相信任何人。

459
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:30,976
I don't trust anyone
at the moment.

460
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:36,815
所以事情就到了这个地步。准备护送。

460
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:36,815
So it's come to that.
Prepare an escort.

461
00:53:38,585 --> 00:53:39,929
皇帝和我自己的新鲜马匹。

461
00:53:38,585 --> 00:53:39,929
Fresh horses for the
emperor and myself.

462
00:53:39,952 --> 00:53:41,987
全套贴身警卫已安装并准备就绪。

462
00:53:39,952 --> 00:53:41,987
Full personal guard
mounted and ready.

463
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:47,494
在这件事得到解决之前，我不会离开你的身边。

463
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:47,494
I'm not leaving your
side until this is settled.

464
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:48,695
我能信任的人太少了。

464
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:48,695
There's so few I can trust.

465
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:50,864
我很感激你，波尔图。

465
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:50,864
I'm grateful for you, Porto.

466
00:53:52,465 --> 00:53:54,000
我的主，我会保护你。

466
00:53:52,465 --> 00:53:54,000
I shall guard you, my lord.

467
00:53:54,034 --> 00:53:55,300
去。

467
00:53:54,034 --> 00:53:55,300
Go.

468
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,371
去。

468
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,371
Go.

469
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:04,610
哥哥，你是说？

469
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:04,610
Brother, you were saying?

470
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:08,847
我只是担心你的安全，

470
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:08,847
I was only worried
for your safety,

471
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:11,317
哥哥。

471
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:11,317
brother.

472
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:14,954
为那些与马苏斯领事结盟的人报仇。

472
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:14,954
Revenge, for those
aligned with Consul Marsus.

473
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:18,625
但现在你的指挥官在这里，

473
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:18,625
But now your commander is here,

474
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:20,960
我相信你会安全的。

474
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:20,960
I'm sure you'll be safe.

475
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,762
是的。

475
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,762
Yes.

476
00:54:32,472 --> 00:54:35,041
提多！提多！

476
00:54:32,472 --> 00:54:35,041
Titus! Titus!
