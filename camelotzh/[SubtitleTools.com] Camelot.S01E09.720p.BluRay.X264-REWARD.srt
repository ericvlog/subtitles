早安
Good morning.

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,110
我疯了吗
Have I gone mad?

15
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,190
我肯定是疯了
Have I gone mad?

16
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,370
不可能啊
It can't be there.

17
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,270
你是谁
What are you?

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,470
我就是你
I'm you.

你不可能是我
You can't be me.

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,820
你怎么可能是我
You can't be me.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,180
我是你的灵魂
I'm your soul.

22
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,220
你那肮脏不堪  满目疮痍的灵魂
Your dirty, damaged soul.

23
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,310
你知道你自己是什么货色
You know what you are.

24
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,240
知道你自己都干过什么
What you've done.

25
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,680
不  不
No. No!

26

好小子  我们会把你
Good lad! We'll

27
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,570
培养成卡米洛特的一名战士

放客气点
A bit more courtsey!

36
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,530

你们都在亚瑟王的庇护之下
you're under King Arthur's protection.

38
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,490
你们可以安置马匹  喝点水
You can rest your horses, get water--

39
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,740
这关口现在关闭了

42
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,070
你觉得练习这么一会儿就够了吗
You think that's enough time on target practice?

43
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,400
大门那里  守卫  都被杀害了
At the gate, the guards, they've been killed!

44
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,190

49
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,620
要派个人拦住他吗
Shall I send a man to dispatch him?

50
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,540
不用  让所有人就位
No. Get everyone in position.

51
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,320
那男孩做的正是我们想要的
That boy's doing exactly what they want.

52
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,690
好了  伙计们  跟上

55
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,270
我没疯  我没疯  我没疯
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I'm not mad.

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,540
我没疯  我没疯
I'm not mad. I'm not mad.

57
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,890
我没疯  求你了  上帝  求你了
I'm not mad. Please, God. Please, God.

58
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,460
我没疯  我没疯

64
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,440
我直勾勾的盯着我自己
I was staring right back at me.

65
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,460
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

66
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,520
伊格兰  伊格兰
Igraine. Igraine.

67
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,990
你去哪里了
Where have you been?

68
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,200
彭德拉根堡  那修女  她把我锁在
Castle Pendragon. The nun, she, she locked me up

69
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,210
一个房间里  把我囚禁在那里
in a room, and... held me prisoner, and...

70
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,970
-没人来救我  -嘘嘘
- No one came! - Shhhh.

71
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,000
伊格兰  伊格兰
Igraine. Igraine.

72
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,810
昨晚你在这里
You were here last night.

73
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,420
我们在一起
We were together.

74
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,730
不
No...

75
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,710
不  不  我杀了守卫
No. No, I killed a guard.

76
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,280
我偷了匹马逃回来  但却发现
I stole a horse, and then when I came back,

77
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,920
我正站在大厅里...
I was standing in the Great Hall, and...

78
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:50,650
-我知道自己做过什么  -不  不
- and I knew what I'd done. - No, no. No...

79
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,030
我早该看出来的
I should have seen.

80
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,750
我早该知道的
I should have known.

81
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,860
你和我  我
You and... me? I...

82
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,510
-我以为是这样  -可我
- So I thought. - But I...

83
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,050
我不记得了
I don't remember.

84
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,580
我不  梅林  我是不是疯了
I don't... Merlin, have I lost my mind?

85
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,170
没有  你没疯
No, you're not losing your mind.

86
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,450
-梅林  我  -是摩根在搞鬼
- Merlin, I... - It's Morgan!

87
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,860
这就是她囚禁你的原因
That's why she held you captive.

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,720
她来过这里
She's been here...

89
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,230
变成了你的模样  伊格兰
...wearing your face. Igraine,

90
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,140
我知道你受了很多苦
I know you've been through hell,

91
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,510
但我们得弄清  她在这里还做了什么
but we have to find out what else she did while she was here.

92
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,920
开门  是摩根
Open up! It's Morgan!

93
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,080
伊格兰逃跑了  她杀了守卫
Igraine escaped. She killed a guard.

94
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,290
我们说话这会她该在回卡米洛特的路上了
She'll be on her way back to Camelot as we speak.

95
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,300
我知道  我看到她了
I know; I saw her.

96
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,940
她看到你了吗
Did she see you?

97
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,020
她只看到了她自己
She only saw herself.

98
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,990
可怜的女人
Poor woman.

99
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,400
所有人都会以为她疯了
Everybody will think she's gone completely mad.

100
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,170
懦弱的人就是容易发疯
Well, madness so often afflicts the weak-minded.

101
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,640
怎么了
What's wrong?

102
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,580
你和国王之间发生过什么吗
Did something happen between you and the king?

103
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,590
别傻了
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

104
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,240
那就发誓
Then swear.

105
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,020
以上帝之名起誓  什么都没发生过

107

那就起誓
Then swear.

108
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,400

我发誓
I swear...

110
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,770
发誓
...that...

111

112
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,300
什么都没
...that nothing...

113
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,790
那没什么  什么都没发生过
It wasn't anything. There was nothing.

114
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,670
什么没什么
What was nothing?

115
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,190
告诉我
Tell me.

116
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,320
桂妮维尔  告诉我
Guinevere, tell me.

117
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,730
是在我们结婚之前
It was before we were married.

118
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,640
就那一次
It was only once.

119
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,700
我从来都不希望你知道这事
I never wanted you to know.

120
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,830
上帝  求你不要用那种眼神看我
Oh, God, please don't look at me like that.

121
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,490
-我受不了  -别
- I can't bare it!  - No.

122
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,860
什么时候
When?

123
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,040
在我成为你妻子之前
Before I was your wife.

124
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,080
可现在我们结婚了  我对你忠贞不二
But now we're married, and, and I'm loyal to you.

125
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,110
如果你对我还有感情  就跟我说实话
If you have any feelings for me, tell me when.

126
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,120
我们婚礼那天
On our wedding day.

127
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,270
对不起
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,260
我做了件很糟的事  但我仍是你妻子
I did a terrible thing, but I'm still your wife.

129
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,010
你不是我妻子
You're not my wife;

130
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,030
你是国王的情妇
you're the king's whore.

131
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,140
你还手啊

134
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,910
-让开  梅林  -里昂提斯
- Out of my way, Merlin. - Leontes...

135
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,580
-怎么回事  -是我和国王之间的恩怨
- What's happened? - My business is with the king.

136
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,680
国王的事就是我的事  过来和我说说
The king's business is mine also. Come here. Tell me.

137
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,760
伊格兰夫人  告诉了我实情
The Lady Igraine, she told me the truth.

138
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,280
什么
What?

139
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,500
亚瑟占有了我妻子
Arthur took my wife.

140
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,420
他和我妻子上床了
He had... my wife.

141
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,310
不可能
No.

142
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,430
难以置信
I can't believe this.

143
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,890
-她向我坦白了  -嘘
- She confessed to me!! - Shh!

144
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,520
国王必须回应他的所作所为
The king has to answer for what he's done.

145
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,940
如果确有其事
If this is true,

146
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,960
那亚瑟的所作所为无可饶恕
what Arthur has done is unforgivable.

147
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,630
可你想怎样呢  你要揍他吗
But what are you going to do? You're going to beat him?

148
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,490
割断他的喉咙吗
Slit his throat?

149
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,970
里昂提斯
Leontes,

150
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,850
你能咽下这口气的
you can bear this cross.

151
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,050
-我知道你可以  -我为何要忍气吞声
- I know you can. - Why should I?

152
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,340
回到桂妮维尔身边  让她自己赎罪吧
Go back to Guinevere. Let her absolve herself.

153
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,640
国王那边我来处理
I'll deal with the king.

154
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,070
你的事进行的怎样
What of your undertaking?

155
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,250
-成功了  -你确定吗
- It worked. - Are you sure?

156
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,700
卡米洛特已经受感染
Camelot is diseased.

157
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,490
我们就等着它病入膏肓吧
We will watch the plague spread.

158
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,890
巴尔东关口的行动已经开始
And the work at Bardon Pass has begun.

159
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,630
-其他的袭击也得跟上  -已经就位
- Other strikes must follow. - It is in motion.

160
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,270
他们已经到了
The men are here.

161
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,710
摩根小姐迫不及待的想与你们会面
My Lady Morgan is most anxious to see you.

162
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,380
我们也一样
So are we to see her.

163
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,190
亚瑟王未曾为我做什么 是您为我提供了
King Arthur's done nothing for me. It's you I owe right now

164
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,370
果腹的食物和居住的房屋  我亏欠您很多
for the food in my belly, and the roof over my head.

165
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,190
我请求您帮我收回我们领地的掌控权
I'm asking you to help me to claim back our land.

166
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,930
你要袭击卡米洛特吗
You want to make a strike on Camelot?

167
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,700
那可是叛国罪
That will be treason.

168
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,900
我们只寻求真理
We seek only to illuminate the truth.

169
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,780
亚瑟保护其子民的许诺是个谎言
Arthur's pledge of protection to his people is a lie.

170
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,330
如今西边边境的巴尔东正受到袭击
Even now his western border at Bardon Pass is under attack.

171
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,330
如果彭德拉根堡的北边  南边  东边
Should there be similar attacks on Pendragon outposts,

172
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,670
也受到相同的袭击
in the north, south, and east,

173
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,670
人们就会发现他们的防御是如此不堪一击
people would understand how fragile their security really is.

174
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,210
有钱领的话  我会清除一切障碍
I will take anything down, so long as there's payment.

175
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,780
重赏之下必有勇夫
Anyone can buy a man and his sword.

176
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,000
如果进行的顺利  皇土之内
If this is done well, the only safe place

177
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,690
将只有在我的羽翼下才是安全的
in the kingdom will be under my protection.

178
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,840
王位自然会落入我手中  而到那时
The crown will fall to me, and when it does,

179
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,780
我将会需要护卫和一位将军
I will need champions and a marshal...

180
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,620
那些投靠我的人
men whose investment to my rule

181
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,050
将得到比金钱更好回报
is greater than the gold in their purses.

182
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,890
那些起誓效忠我的人
Men who have pledged themselves to me,

183
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,580
将心  身
mind, body,

184
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,960
和魂都交予我的人
and soul.

185
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,740
我向你起誓
You have my pledge.

186
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,340
怎么了
What's the matter?

187
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,390
里昂提斯知道了  我们婚礼那天的事
Leontes knows. About us, about the wedding day.

188
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,500
他什么都知道了
He knows everything!

189
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,320
什么意思  他怎么知道的
What do you mean? How does he know?

190
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,470
-我告诉他了  -什么
- I told him. - What?!

191
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,790
他好像已经知道了似的
It's like he already knew!

192
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,690
你说什么了吗
Did you say something?

193
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,980
我从没对任何人说起
I never said anything to anyone!

194
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,790
那他是怎么知道的
Then how did he already know?

195
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,400
他在哪
Where is he?

196
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,430
-你只会越描越黑  -我得试着
- You'll only make it worse. - I have to try

197
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,310
跟他解释
and explain to him.

198
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,270
你能说什么啊
What could you possibly say?

199
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,360
说不是你的错  我强迫你的
That it wasn't your doing; I pressured you.

200
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,200
可那不是真的
That's not true.

201
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,610
我不能回避他
I can't avoid him.

202
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,610
他是我的朋友  我的护卫
He's my friend, my champion.

203
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,590
我们当初为何要那么做啊
Why did we ever do it?

204
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,260
里昂提斯是个好人
Leontes is a good man.

205
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,680
不会有事的
It'll be all right.

206
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,050
会的
It won't.

207
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,790
-她在干嘛  -在练习
- What's she doing? - She's practicing.

208
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,710
练习什么
Practicing what?

209
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,700
-自控能力  -这能有什么用
- Self control. - How will that help us?

210
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,490
我们绑架了国王的母亲
We kidnapped the king's mother.

211
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,630
你的惶恐对摩根毫无帮助
Your fear is useless to Morgan.

212
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,130
要么相信她  要么就走人
Giver her your faith or nothing at all.

213
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,160
但总会有报应的
But surely there will be retribution.

214
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,260
会的  所以我们要团结一致
There will be, and we must stand firm.

215
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,420
国王的母亲已经疯了
The king's mother has gone mad.

216
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,440
梅林孤掌难鸣了
Merlin is acting alone.

217
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,790
懂吗
Understand?

218
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,590
你见到国王的话  让他来找我
You see the king, you tell him to come and find me.

219
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,680
找到我前  不要让别人跟他说话
No one is to speak to him before I do.

220
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,850
-懂吗  -是
- Understand? - Right.

221
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,270
我知道他们彼此喜欢
I knew that they had eyes for each other,

222
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,130
但我不知道都到了这种程度
but I had no idea it had got to this.

223
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,790
可摩根却发现了
But Morgan did.

224
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,490
我需要你帮我摆平此事
I need your help to put this right.

225
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,060
这里的人仰仗你  向你吐露心声
People here rely on you, confide in you.

226
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,310
他们把你视作指引
They look to you as their guide.

227
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,200
那我该怎么做
Well, what can I do?

228
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,420
其他人绝不能知道此事
The men must never find out about this.

229
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,260
他们都会觉得受到了背叛
They'll all feel betrayed.

230
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,420
让桂妮维尔冷静  千万别乱说
Keep Guinevere under control and quiet.

231
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,780
那摩根呢
What about Morgan?

232
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,730
我会去找她的
Oh, I'll get to her.

233
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,380
但得先找到亚瑟
I have to find Arthur first.

234
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,870
我所有的努力  又有人阻碍我的计划
All I've worked for, and it's people who get in the way again.

235
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,190
坏事的总是人
Always people.

236
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,490
我要见国王
I need to speak to the king.

237
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,650
-怎么回事  -我的家人需要帮助
- What's the trouble here? - My family need his help.

238
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,060
国王现在不能见你
The king can't see you now.

239
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,350
我要和他说话
I need to speak to him!

240
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,830
像其他人一样等着
Wait your turn like everyone else.

241
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,510
卡米洛特在垂死挣扎呢
Camelot is in its death throes.

242
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,090
一旦谎言被揭穿
Once its lies are exposed,

243
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,150
它就将迅速衰败
it will quickly decay,

244
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,210
人们在恐惧和惊慌之中将会左顾右盼
and people will look around in fear and panic.

245
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,960
而我则会接纳他们
And I will be there to pick them up.

246
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,830
他们会需要我
They will need me.

247
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,100
男人总自称高人一等  他们却
Men claim to be superior, but it's them

248
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,760
比女人更容易被自己的感情驾驭
more than women who are ruled by their passions.

249
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,560
女人能忍男人之不能忍
Women endure what men cannot bear.

250
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,460
所以人民需要一位强势的女王
Which is why people need a strong queen.

251
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,850
把镀金的那条裙子拿来
Bring me the gilded dress.

252
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,710
有人来访吗
Expecting an official visit?

253
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,560
邀请我们的朋友来  我需要些看客
Invite our friends. I'll need an audience.

254
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,230
我知道我伤你有多深
I know how much I've hurt you.

255
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,400
我羞愧不已
I'm so ashamed.

256
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,640
抱我
Hold me.

257
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,880
爱我
Make love to me.

258
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,000
你也是这样吻他的吗
Is this how you kissed him?

259
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,260
你说只有一次
Once, you said.

260
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,820
我怎么知道你没撒谎呢
How do I know you're telling me the truth?

261
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,930
你父亲过世的时候
It happened again on the journey

262
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,200
你去找他的路上又发生了  对不对
you took when your father died, didn't it?

263
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,200
不不不不  我以我的名誉发誓
No, no, no, no. I swear on my honour--

264
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,210
你的名誉
You gave your honour...

265
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,820
已经归亚瑟了
...to Arthur.

266
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,720
我知道我错了
I know what I did was wrong.

267
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,430
我只求你的原谅
I'm just asking you to forgive me.

268
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,780
我也想  但我做不到
And I want to, but I don't know how to.

269
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,730
我配不上你
I don't deserve you.

270
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,470
你早上为何会问起
What made you ask me this morning?

271
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,990
伊格兰说的话让我起疑了
It was something Igraine said.

272
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,370
伊格兰
Igraine...

273
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,670
她说什么了
What did she say?

274
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,240
我要是不问你  你会说吗
If I hadn't have asked you, would you have told me?

275
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,140
我宁可撒谎
I'd rather lie,

276
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,100
活在愧疚当中
and live with my guilt

277
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,540
也不愿伤害你
than ever hurt you.

278
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,020
我宁愿你不要撒谎
And I would rather you do anything than lie to me.

279
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,050
你该告诉我的
You should have told me.

280
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,640
我发过誓不会背叛她  不会背叛任何人
I swore I'd never betray her or anyone else.

281
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,430
所以你甚至不打算抵赖了
So you're not even gonna try and deny it.

282
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,180
不  这是事实
No. It's the truth.

283
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,680
永远不要向这里的其他人承认  懂吗
Never admit that to anyon else here. Understand?

284
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,120
不是那么简单的事  我伤了我在乎的人
It's not that easy. I've hurt people I care about.

285
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,840
那些人无关要紧  你是国王
Those people don't matter! You're a king.

286
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,490
你只要对你的领土负责  别的不管
Your responsibility is to your realm! Nothing more.

287
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,930
那你要我怎么做
So what do you suggest I do?

288
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,530
要么掩盖此事
Cover this up,

289
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,460
要么就准备好失去一切
or risk losing everything.

290
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,210
我必须要跟国王说话
I must speak to the king!

291
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,060
你是什么人
Who the hell are you?

292
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,040
-陛下  求您  -你有何事
- Your Majesty, please! - What do you want?

293
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,040
我家人在巴尔东被包围了
My family is under siege at Bardon Pass.

294
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,540
你叫什么
What's your name?

295
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,640
阿尔比恩  陛下
Albion, Majesty.

296
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,000
我父亲  他派我来告诉您
My father, he sent me to tell you

297
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,290
有人在袭击巴尔东
that men are attacking Bardon Pass.

298
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,560
必须保卫巴尔东
The Bardon Pass has to be defended.

299
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,550
让大家集合
I want the men assembled now.

300
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,600
巴尔东是进入卡米洛特主要商道
Bardon Pass is the main trade route into Camelot.

301
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,480
若失去这条路  大家就会说我们软弱
If we lose that, word wil spread of our weakness,

302
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,870
我们的领土就会受到威胁
and all our land could come under threat.

303
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,250
我们要保护那家人  保护我们的领地
We protect the family and our territory.

304
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,650
不能有任何妥协
Nothing less is acceptable.

305
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,410
怎么不见里昂提斯
Where's Leontes?

306
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,750
巴尔东受袭
Bardon Pass is under attack.

307
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,770
你的人需要你
Your men need you.

308
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,420
我要回家  回我的村子去
I'm going home to my village.

309
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,280
这里就是你的家  我们是你的家人
This is your home. We are your family.

310
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,580
履行你对国王的誓言
Fulfil your oath to your king,

311
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,940
否则你的荣誉将毁于一旦
or your honour counts for nothing.

312
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,770
跟国王说所谓的荣誉去吧
You talk to the king of honour.

313
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,830
他玷污了我的新娘
He fucked my bride.

314
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,140
此事了结  亚瑟会承担责任
And Arthur will be held to account when this is over.

315
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,930
但是现在我们有危机要处理
But right now we have a crisis on our hands,

316
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,660
你对你的人有一份责任
and you have a duty to your men.

317
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,370
等我回来
When I return,

318
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,090
就与卡米洛特一刀两断
I'm done with Camelot.

319
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,240
那要由你和你妻子来决定了
That's for you and your wife to decide.

320
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,980
桂妮维尔  让他去吧
Guinevere! Leave the men be!

321
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,320
你觉得我凭什么还会听你的
What makes you think I'm ever going to listen to you again?

322
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,750
我告诉过你离他远点  你没听我的
I told you to stay away from him, but you didn't listen to me.

323
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,270
所以你就告诉里昂提斯我背叛他了
So you tell Leontes I betrayed him?

324
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,100
-我什么都没说  -只有你知道
- No, I didn't say anything. - You are the only one who knew.

325
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,420
桂妮维尔  请听我说
Guinevere, please,

326
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,590
这里发生的诡异之事
there are things that have gone on here that are far,

327
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,350
远超你的想象
far more wicked than anything that you have done.

328
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
有时间时我会解释的
In time I will explain.

329
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,730
里昂提斯忘带他的祈祷书了
Leontes forgot his prayer book.

330
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,650
他上战场总是带着的
He never goes to battle without it.

331
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,430
你真的觉得
Do you really think

332
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,230
他现在会想见你吗
that he wants to see you now?

333
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,860
只有那一次
It was once.

334
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,800
只有一次啊
Only once.

335
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,950
不急啊  里昂提斯
No hurry, Leontes.

336
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,770
我们只是都等着你罢了
We're all only waiting for you.

337
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,870
高文
Gawain...

338
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,540
别让国王离开你的视线
Never let the king out of your sight.

339
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,480
要是里昂提斯企图伤害亚瑟  就阻止他
If Leontes moves to hurt Arthur, step in.

340
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,990
里昂提斯
Leontes?

341
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,360
现在别质疑我的话
Don't question me. Not now.

342
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,440
要是他或者任何人要伤害国王
If he or anyone else makes to harm the king,

343
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,850
你要做你该做的
do what you have to do.

344
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,480
笑一笑  装得像我刚讲了个笑话
Now, smile, like I've taught you a joke.

345
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,750
好了  我们走
All right, let's move!

346
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,870
胜利归来
Be victorious!

347
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,280
-为了卡米洛特  -为了卡米洛特
- For Camelot! - For Camelot!

348
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,800
为了卡米洛特
For Camelot!

349
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,710
现在商道全无安全可言
The trade routes are now completely unsafe!

350
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,660
国王的旗帜毫无效力
The banner of the king means nothing!

351
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,460
先生们  拜托
Gentlemen, please!

352
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,920
求你们
Please.

353
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,860
要对我弟弟有信心
We must have faith in my brother.

354
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,710
信任替代不了信心
Faith is no substitute for real confidence!

355
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,860
我绝不会背叛亚瑟
I will not heed disloyalty against Arthur.

356
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,790
那不是他的错
It's not his fault

357
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,140
如果有无耻小人在他面前蛊惑
if there are rogue elements within his court

358
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,820
他便很难控制局面
that are difficult for him to control.

359
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,910
谁是无耻小人
What rogue elements?

360
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,580
传闻他的巫师对他影响很大
His sorcerer is rumoured to have a great deal of influence.

361
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,870
据说他的行为...有时会鲁莽
He's been known to act... rashly at times.

362
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,750
不听国王指挥吗
Independent of the king's wishes?

363
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,510
-有些人说他疯了  -为了权利吗
- Some say that's he's mad. - What, for power?

364
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,640
不管他如何疯狂
However mad he is,

365
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,380
我们的国王都有能力控制
our king will keep him in check.

366
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,490
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

367
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,600
你要去彭德拉根城堡  是吗
You're going to Castle Pendragon, aren't you?

368
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,410
-你别跟去  -我想看到她被惩罚
- You're not coming. - I want to see her punished.

369
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,130
我不该让她亲近
I should never have let her get close.

370
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,110
但你没克制住  是吗
But you didn't, did you?

371
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,210
你是让我亲近
You let me get close.

372
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,150
如果你当时是那样想的  我很高兴
If that's what you were thinking, I'm glad.

373
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,900
只是很抱歉  那不是真的我
I'm just sorry I wasn't really there.

374
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,530
我也很遗憾
So am I.

375
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,630
我们去彭德拉根城堡
We'll go to Castle Pendragon,

376
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,770
把她带回来
bring her back

377
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,190
在国王为她的背叛承担罪责之前
drag her back if we have to

378
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,540
绑都要把她绑回来
before the king to answer for her treason.

379
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,430
摩根必需臣服于卡米洛特
Morgan must submit to the authority of Camelot.

380
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,430
他们在那儿
There they are.

381
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,620
敌众我寡
We're vastly outnumbered.

382
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,500
亚瑟  如果我们正面进攻
Arthur, we'll be far too exposed

383
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,850
就会在开阔地过早暴露
if we approach from the front.

384
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,070
你说过还有条小路
You said there was another way?

385
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,430
我们得弃马而行
We'll have to leave the horses here.

386
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:45,980
就在上面
It's just up there.

387
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,240
好  到我前面去  上
Right. Get across me. Go.

388
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,680
里昂提斯
Leontes.

389
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,820
没事  到我前面去
It's fine. Come past me.

390
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,620
做人梯  里昂提斯
Set, Leontes?

391
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,490
用力
Push.

392
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,660
我们是来帮忙的  孩子
We're the help, son!

393
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,760
-格里菲斯  是我们  -阿尔比恩
- Griffith, it's us! - Albion!

394
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,450
你找到他们了
You got them!

395
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,220
拉我们一把
Give us a hand.

396
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,280
用力  老兄
Come on, old man.

397
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,250
是他吗
Is that him?

398
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,120
-我是亚瑟  -过来  见见我父亲
- I'm Arthur. - Come. See my father.

399
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,100
阿尔比恩  你成功了  好孩子
Albion! Ah, you did it! Good lad!

400
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,250
他们今早开始集结
They've been gathering since morning.

401
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,020
谢谢你们来帮忙  殿下
Thank you for coming, Your Highness.

402
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,000
-你肯定是卢坎了  -是
- You must be Lucan. - Yes.

403
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,340
先办正事  我们的徽旗
First things first: our colours.

404
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,600
过来
Come.

405
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,710
正如摩根所料  他们来了
So they came, exactly as Morgan predicted.

406
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,330
她很了解她的家人
She knows her family well.

407
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,860
她确信她兄弟不会坐视不理
She swore her brother wouldn't ignore a lost cause.

408
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,290
那就是他
There he is.

409
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,140
-我们人数是他们的四倍  -不可低估他们
- We outnumber them 4 to 1. - Don't underestimate them.

410
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,150
摩根说他们训练有素
Morgan says they're highly trained.

411
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,040
-我们会盯紧他们  -很好
- Then we'll keep them locked in. - Perfect.

412
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,050
我要弑杀国王
A king to the slaughter.

413
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,510
这是我报效摩根的方式
This is my way to Morgan.

414
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,850
我要将国王之剑交于她
I'll deliver her the king's sword.

415
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,120
她将屈膝谢恩于我
She'll be on her knees to me in gratitude.

416
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,140
我们在等他们进攻
We've been waiting for them to attack.

417
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,890
对  他们人数占优
Well, they have the numbers,

418
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,060
但我们居高临下  这是很大的优势
but we have the tower; it's a good vantage point.

419
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,630
弓箭手居高对我们有利
Archers up there might help us.

420
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,950
但我们弓箭会耗尽
Until we've run out of arrows.

421
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,810
我们会尽力保护你家
We'll secure your home before that happens.

422
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,080
我去检查布防  看看是否有漏洞
I'll check the layout; see if there are any weaknesses.

423
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,450
这些人是谁
Who are all these people?

424
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,940
王土之内已无宁日
There are attacks going on throughout the realm.

425
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,200
无力防备之人只能聚集于此
The undefended are flocking here.

426
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,710
寻求庇护
For protection.

427
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,610
她在哪里
Where is she?

428
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,970
摩根小姐事务繁忙
Lady Morgan is consumed with her task.

429
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,840
她没空
She's unavailable.

430
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,560
她必须见我
Not to me, she isn't.

431
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,040
摩根
Morgan!

432
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,980
你在哪里
Where are you?

433
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,450
你就像条毒蛇躲于暗处吗
Hiding in the dark like the poisonous snake you are?

434
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,450
冷静点  巫师
Calm down, sorcerer.

435
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,340
你怎么来了
Why have you come here?

436
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,120
巫术
Witchcraft.

437
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,130
劫持
Abduction.

438
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,220
叛逆
Treason!

439
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,180
你对这些指控有何回应
How do you answer to these charges?

440
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,220
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

441
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,550
你否认用魔法变成别人的容貌吗
So you deny using magic to assume another's shape?

442
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,540
这里这么多人  只有你在无端指责我
You of all people dare hurl such accusations at me.

443
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,550
你挟持了伊格兰
You abducted Igraine,

444
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,420
殴打她
had her beaten,

445
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,470
变作她的模样  穿行于卡米洛特
and walked through Camelot wearing her face.

446
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,010
胡说八道
That's not true.

447
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,840
现在摩根是我们唯一信任的人
Morgan is the only one we can trust right now!

448
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,450
这是干嘛  愚人大合唱吗
What is this? Hmm? Your chorus of fools?

449
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,450
他们都是国王的良民
They are the good people of the realm.

450
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,390
她绑住我  把我囚禁起来
She tied me up! Held me prisoner!

451
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,800
折磨我
Tormented me!

452
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,290
可怜的女人肯定被蛊惑了
Poor woman is clearly deluded.

453
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,640
我还记得那房间
I remember the room.

454
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,860
那儿有标记  女巫的标记
There were markings... witches' markings!

455
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,080
这里根本没有这样的房间
There is no such room here.

456
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,830
就是这里
It's here.

457
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,080
明明就是这里
It was in here.

458
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,780
我发誓之前是在这里
I swear it was.

459
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,510
这里是和平与祈祷之所
This is a place of peace and prayer.

460
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,140
这下面应该有标记
There are markings under here.

461
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,130
我们光明磊落
We have nothing to hide.

462
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,910
还有个护卫叫道纳尔
There was a guard named Donal.

463
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,880
他曾和我一起在这里
He was in here with me.

464
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,970
后来他出什么事了
Then what happened to him?

465
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,290
你良心上一定承受着
You must have so many heavy sins

466
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,570
太多罪孽  孩子
on your conscience, child.

467
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,830
你不需要忏悔吗
Is there nothing you need to confess?

468
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,050
她想让他们相信  我们都疯了
She is trying to convince them that we're mad.

469
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,640
但我知道这里发生过什么
But I know what happened in here.

470
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,110
她经常像这样吗
Is she often like this?

471
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,960
有个男孩叫瑞德伍德
There was a boy named Redwald.

472
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,520
他与这一切毫无瓜葛
He was an innocent in all this.

473
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,050
现在他死了
Now he's dead.

474
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,850
你告诉我有何用
Why are you telling me?

475
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,480
我知道你有份参与
I know you're a part of this.

476
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,610
你要给国王一个交代
You will answer to the king.

477
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,850
我很期待
I look forward to that.

478
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,230
用力  拉
Come on. Pull.

479
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,020
使劲拉
Pull.

480
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,410
好了  就放这里
Right there. Right there.

481
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,550
里昂提斯
Leontes.

482
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,080
别责怪她
Don't blame her.

483
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,100
都是我的错
It was all me.

484
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,020
我要逮捕你
I am arresting you.

485
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,900
在法庭上你将被指控叛国罪
And you will stand charges of treason at court.

486
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,920
你不能逮捕她  她是摩根·彭德拉根
You can't arrest her. She's Morgan Pendragon!

487
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,360
我能这样做  也会这样做
I can, and I will,

488
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,180
以国王的名义
in the name of the king.

489
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,180
梅林  这太荒谬了
Merlin, this is completely absurd.

490
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,010
我要用武力把你带走
I will take you by force.

491
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,560
武力
Force?

492
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,300
卡米洛特承诺
All these people were promised

493
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,320
用武力保护所有这些人
protection by Camelot's force.

494
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,950
但你们的承诺现在何处
But where is it now?

495
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,910
他们的家园被攻击
Their homes are being attacked,

496
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,700
你们不用武力保护他们
and you'd turn your force on me

497
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,010
却来对付我吗
instead of protecting them?

498
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,820
亚瑟在哪里
Where is Arthur?

499
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,470
在你难以触及之处
Safe from your reach.

500
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,190
整个国家都在流血
While the entire country bleeds,

501
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,570
你却闯入这里无端指控我
you storm in here with your insane charges.

502
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,740
我们不会听之任之  卫兵
We won't allow it! Guards!

503
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,120
抓住他们
Hold them!

504
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,340
人心向我  巫师
The people are with me, sorcerer.

505
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,010
把他们绑起来  双手捆牢
Tie them up. Bind their hands securely.

506
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,520
你不明白吗
Don't you understand?

507
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,040
人们已经不信任国王
The people have lost faith in the king.

508
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,020
他们的家园遭受攻击
Their homes are under attack.

509
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,380
所以他们就来求助你和摩根
So they come here to you and Morgan.

510
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,160
我们绝不会抛弃他们
We would never turn away the needy.

511
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,080
你们真圣洁
How very saintly of you.

512
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,980
你在人们的拥戴下
You brought your king to the throne

513
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,870
协助国王登上了宝座
with the support of the people.

514
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,070
现在他失了民心
Now he's lost their support.

515
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,680
你该何去何从呢
Where does that leave you?

516
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,610
很好
Oh, very good.

517
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
你把我们玩弄于股掌之间
Play us at our own game.

518
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,310
你到底是什么角色
Who are you?

519
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,430
这与你有何关系
Why does this even matter to you?

520
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,070
我是摩根的慰藉之源
I am a source of solace to Morgan.

521
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,630
傀儡还是操纵者
Puppet or puppeteer?

522
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,250
这问题我一直没想明白
You see, that's what I can't quite work out.

523
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,550
他们对你也有同样的疑问
They ask the same about you.

524
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,700
你为摩根效劳
And what is it you get in return

525
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,430
能得到什么回报呢
for doing Morgan's work?

526
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,270
为摩根效劳就是种奖赏
Service is its own reward.

527
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,950
很聪明  我有点欣赏你了
Clever. I could grow to like you.

528
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,960
在卡米洛特多事之秋
Building alliances quietly

529
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,840
悄悄地建立联盟
while fomenting disquiet in Camelot.

530
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,170
那是她魅力所致
Her delusions must be contagious.

531
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,340
就这样了
Is this it?

532
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,560
任凭他们扣押我们当作人质吗
Do we just let them hold us hostage?

533
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,090
是的
Yes.

534
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,180
一个强大的巫师
A mighty sorcerer,

535
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,930
被一根绳子  绑住
constrained... by a rope.

536
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,320
如果这是人们的意愿
If this is the will of the people,

537
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,190
那就这样吧
so be it,

538
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,410
但你最好有心理准备  小修女
but you'd better be confident, little nun,

539
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,410
因为我可以等待
because I can wait.

540
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,920
我的耐心超乎你的想像
I have more patience than you can ever imagine.

541
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,660
或许关于你魔法的传说
Or perhaps the stories of your sorcery

542
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,450
都只是杜撰的故事
are just stories after all.

543
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,160
卡米洛特不是建立在魔法之上
Camelot isn't built on magic,

544
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,330
而是依靠人民  依靠他们的信任
but on people, on their faith.

545
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,340
我相信他们终究会看穿你们的伎俩
I have this belief they'll see through your ploys.

546
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,090
你没事吧
Are you all right?

547
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,260
没事
I'm fine.

548
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,140
出什么事了
What's wrong?

549
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,170
现在不便说  凯
Not now, Kay.

550
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,890
是我和国王之间的事
It's between me and the king.

551
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,180
有一名骑士过来了
There's a rider coming!

552
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,510
骑士逼近
Rider approaching!

553
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,470
这是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

554
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,890
瞄准骑士  放箭
Target the rider! Arrows!

555
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,350
是桂妮维尔
It's Guinevere!

556
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,600
不  不
No. No!

557
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,190
桂妮维尔
Guinevere!

558
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,800
亚瑟
Arthur!

559
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,100
是国王
It's the king!

560
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,980
是国王  瞄准国王
It's the king! Target the king!

561
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,700
我说跑  你就拼命跑
When I say "Now", you run as best you can.

562
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,180
好
All right.

563
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,770
跑
Go now!

564
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,100
快跑  快
Go! Move!

565
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,420
快跑  接住她
Run! Take her!

566
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,300
快走  欧菲尔斯
Go! Ulfius!

567
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,640
快带她离开这里
Take her! Get her out of here!

568
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,610
-你做过什么  -什么意思
- What did you do?! - What do you mean?

569
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,720
你做过什么
What did you do?!

570
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,810
放开国王  凯
Hands of the king, Kay!

571
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,940
我了解你  你做了什么
I know you! What happened?!

572
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,050
-凯  -里昂提斯
- Kay! - Leontes.

573
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,870
告诉他们
Tell them!

574
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,930
我背叛了里昂提斯
I betrayed Leontes.

575
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,190
以最恶劣的方式背叛了他
In the worst way I could have.

576
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,150
不
No...

577
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,230
就在我婚礼当天早上
It was the morning of my wedding.

578
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,160
他比我先占有了她
He had her first.

579
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,920
然后他做了我们的证婚人
And then he married us.

580
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,200
-凯  -别跟我说话
- Kay-- - Don't talk to me.

581
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,070
凯
Kay!

582
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,830
你就是死性难改  是吧
You just can't stop yourself, can you?

583
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,910
任何女人你都赶出手
Any woman is fair game.

584
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,340
不是那样  从来都不是那样
It's not like that, and it never is.

585
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,280
别找借口了  我听够了
Don't try to find an excuse; I've heard them all before.

586
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,050
-我爱她  -那是当然
- I love her. - Of course you do!

587
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,080
就像你爱其他那些女人一样
Like you loved all the others!

588
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,440
我爱她  可她嫁给了别人  我接受了现实
I love her, but she married someone else, and I accept that.

589
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,560
你接受了
You accept it?

590
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,600
你毁了里昂提斯的婚姻  还好意思说你接受了
After you destroyed Leontes' marriage.

591
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,920
怎么  你希望他  希望我们都无视这事吗
And, what, he's expected, we're expected, to ignore it?!

592
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,450
你以前就这德行
'Cause that's what you're used to

593
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,380
从小时候起  这种事就没停过
it's what always happens, ever since we were boys.

594
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,360
-不  这次不一样  -一样
- No, this isn't the same. - It is!

595
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,360
因为你狗改不了吃屎
Because you never change!

596
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,050
你不配为王
You're not a worthy king.

597
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,430
你甚至不配做我的兄弟
You're not even a worthy brother.

598
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,470
反正咱们从来就无血缘关系
At least we were never linked by blood.

599
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,720
你又回来了  并且又要不光彩地离开了
Again you return, and again you leave in disgrace.

600
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,560
还有你  梅林
And you, Merlin,

601
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,310
你真该留在我离开你的那温柔乡里
you should have stayed in bed where I left you.

602
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:33,550
他们试图逮捕我  将我绑去卡米洛特
They tried to arrest me and drag me to Camelot!

603
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,460
好啊  我这就去卡米洛特
Well, I will go to Camelot!

604
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,140
我要去揭露这巫师的恶行
I will expose the corruption of this sorcerer,

605
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,460
然后辅佐我王弟  重整朝纲
and help the king, my brother, to restore order.

606
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,670
让所有人都能在我这里
Let all who seek a safe harbour

607
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,650
找到他们渴求的安定
find one with me.

608
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,780
里昂提斯
Leontes.

609
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,270
你为何前来
Who did you come here for?

610
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,780
为了你
You.

611
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,520
只为了你
Only you.

612
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,470
别无视我
Don't ignore me!

613
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,370
-一切还没结束  -你怎么知道
- This is not over!  - How can you be so sure?

614
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,550
因为在我们婚礼当天
Because I made a promise

615
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,960
我曾在上帝面前起誓
on our wedding day in front of God.

616
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,850
你忘了带这个
You left without it.

617
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,170
你留着吧
Keep it.

618
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,030
可它是你的
But it's yours.

619
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,720
你以前不也是我的么
You were mine too.

620
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,490
-让一让  -是谁啊
- Make way. - Who is it?

621
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,840
现在是跟他们谈话的绝佳时机
The perfect opportunity to talk to them.

622
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,840
袭击起作用了
The attacks are working.

623
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,550
是谁
Who is it?

624
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,390
这些是什么人
Who are all these people?

625
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,790
边境发生了一系列袭击事件
There's been a series of attacks at the boundaries.

626
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,730
这些都是来自边境的受难家庭
There are all families from frontier houses across the realm.

627
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,500
他们正赶往卡米洛特
They're heading for Camelot.

628
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,980
他们害怕留在家乡被害
They're scared to be at home.

629
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,130
我叫摩根·彭德拉根
My name is Morgan Pendragon.

630
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,960
我正带两名谋反者
I'm taking 2 conspirators

631
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,330
去卡米洛特接受国王的判决
to Camelot to face the king's justice.

632
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:42,730
如果你们跟我一道启程  我会保你们平安
If you leave with me now, I can promise you protection.

633
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,410
走吧
Let's go.

634
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,190
跟着摩根
Go with Morgan.

635
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,120
你们无需害怕任何事
You have nothing to fear now.

636
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,960
在卡米洛特你们将会很安全
You will be safe at Camelot.

637
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,320
跟我们一起走吧
Come with us. Come with us.

638
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,890
这些人信任摩根渐渐超过了信任亚瑟
All these people are starting to believe Morgan over Arthur.

639
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,490
我们得做点什么
We have to do something. You have to.

640
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,670
这是陷阱  这就是她的意图
That's the trap. That's what she wants.

641
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,450
现在使用任何巫术都会正中她的下怀
Any hint of sorcery now will play into her hands

642
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,780
会让人们对我们反目相向
and turn the people against us for good.

643
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,260
如果能阻止她
Well, maybe we have to take that risk

644
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,880
也许我们应该冒险一试
just to stop her.

645
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,180
这些人永远不会跟从我们的
These people will never follow us.

646
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,550
我们不是解决问题的关键
We're not the solution to this.

647
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,140
那什么才是
Then what is?

648
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,250
亚瑟
Only Arthur.

649
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,770
你我只是星星之火
You and I, we're the sparks that made him.

650
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,100
现在他必须自己燃起燎原之势
He has to become the flame now.

651
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,060
他必须依靠自己来获胜
He has to prevail by his own design.

652
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,640
无论他们如何挑衅
Whatever the provocation,

653
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,870
你我都要坚强忍受并且缄口不言
you and I must stay strong and silent,

654
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,880
对你的儿子有点信心吧  答应我
and have faith in your son. Promise me.

655
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,850
你确定这是最好的方法吗
Are you sure this is the best approach?

656
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,380
只有这样
This way Arthur will see

657
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,350
亚瑟才能看清他姐姐的真面目
his sister's true colours once and for all.

658
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,850
这将纠正他对她的错误感觉
This will finally break the misplaced loyalty he feels to her.

659
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,880
-快点  -看
- Hurry. - Look.

660
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,740
我有话要对国王说
I want to talk to the king.

661
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,790
那就说吧
So talk.

662
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,670
你们有一次投降的机会
You have one chance to surrender.

663
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,960
你真不该浪费精力走过来
You could have saved yourself a walk.

664
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,130
你们杀了我的守卫
You killed my guards!

665
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,920
威胁到了我的领土
You threatened my territory!

666
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,570
那今天就是你们的死期了
Then today you die.

667
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,570
滚你妈的
Fuck you!

668
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,140
高文  稳住
Gawain, hold.

669
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,860
准备进攻
Prepare for the attack.

670
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,860
来吧  你们听到他的话了
Come on! You heard him!

671
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,540
进攻
Attack!

672
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,950
欧菲尔斯  带她离开
Ulfius, get her out of her!

673
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,140
凯
Kay!

674
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,440
阿尔比恩  进去
Albion! Get inside!

675
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,950
-母亲  母亲  -去找你父亲
- Mother! Mother! - Get your father.

676
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,730
亚瑟
Arthur!

677
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,160
你得下令撤退  我们死伤太过惨重了
You have to sound a retreat. We've lost too many men!

678
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,790
这他妈算什么  我说过让你几个像样的
What the hell is this mess? I told you to find the best men!

679
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,930
我找了
I did!

680
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,240
可对手太精明  而且他们都受过良好的训练
But those men are clever, and they're well trained!

681
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,940
母亲  我们会救你的
Mother, we'll help you.

682
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,040
欧菲尔斯
Ulfius!

683
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,090
撤退
Fall back!

684
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,380
-搭把手  -快撤
- Bring a hand! - Hurry!

685
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,160
快来帮我一把
Come on, help me!

686
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,500
-撤回原位  -撤
- Back to positions! - Back!!

687
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,290
回到原位
Back to your positions!

688
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:26,910
凯
Kay!

689
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,580
凯
Kay!

690
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,510
-放下他  -他们在撤退
- Put him down. - They're retreating!

691
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,270
欧菲尔斯牺牲了
Ulfius is dead.

692
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,440
够了
Then that's it.

693
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,010
带上凯和这家人  从我们过来的小路撤离
Take Kay, take the family, and go out the way we came in.

694
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,710
我会在前方分散他们的注意力
I'll create a diversion from the front,

695
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,730
为你们争取撤退的时间
give you time to get away.

696
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,930
-那你呢  -我随后就来
- What about you? - I'll be right behind you.

697
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,510
必须有人去分散他们的注意力
Someone needs to provide the diversion.

698
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,400
-但不能让你去  -我们已有一死两伤
- Not you, though. - We have 1 dead and 2 injured.

699
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,690
必须让他们安全撤离
We have to get them to safety.

700
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,110
我知道这关口很重要  但你们已经尽力了
I know the pass is important, but you've done all you could.

701
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,020
别管这地方了  跟我们一起走吧
Forget about it now. Come with us.

702
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,490
我留下
I'll stay.

703
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,580
-你走  -不行
- You go. - No.

704
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,470
不得争论  不得辩驳
No discussions, no arguments.

705
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,800
我要所有人立即离开  帮我扶凯起来
I want everyone out of here. Now! Help me get Kay.

706
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,730
来吧
Come on.

707
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,390
要让他们以为我们都还在这里
We'll make them think that we're all still here,

708
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,770
为你们争取时间撤离  快走吧
give you time to escape. Now get a move on.

709
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,850
没时间了
We don't have any time.

710
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,910
亚瑟  梅林命我保护你
Arthur. I have orders from Merlin to protect you.

711
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,700
我不需要保护了
I don't need protecting any more.

712
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,810
听着  我知道你想做什么
Look, I know what you're doing,

713
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,510
可你不能为了摆平一切
but you're not going to set everything else straight

714
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,420
就做傻事
with some stupid gesture.

715
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,490
听着  带伤员去那栋损毁的建筑
Listen, take the injured to the ruined building

716
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,880
从小路过去  我随后就到
we passed on the way in. I'll follow on--

717
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,680
没准还会比你们先到呢
probably get there before you.

718
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,300
我们另一边再会
I'll see you on the other side.

719
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,590
小心脚下  接住她  伙计们
Mind your footing. Got her, boys.

720
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,600
-放松  勇敢点  -是
- Easy. Be brave. - Yes.

721
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,300
懦夫
Cowards!!

722
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,140
你们就这么点本事了吗
Is that all you've got?! This...

723
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,060
这片土地属于你们的国王
...land belongs to your king!

724
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,510
我们会誓死保卫这里
And we will protect it to the death!

725
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,680
他们在嘲笑我们  华莱士
They're taunting us, Wallace.

726
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,870
你喜欢被嘲笑吗
Are you enjoying being taunted?

727
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,980
我已经派人去请求支援了
I've sent for reinforcements.

728
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:29,750
他们太强了  跟我们不是一个档次的
They're too good for us to attack just on level numbers.

729
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,440
我向摩根保证过会从亚瑟的尸体上带回他的剑
I promised Morgan I would take Arthur's sword from his dead body.

730
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,240
我不会让她失望的
I will not let her down.

731
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,770
亚瑟王将死于我们之手
King Arthur dies at our hands.

732
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,470
今晚  就在此地
Here. Tonight.

733
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,530
决一死战
To the death.
