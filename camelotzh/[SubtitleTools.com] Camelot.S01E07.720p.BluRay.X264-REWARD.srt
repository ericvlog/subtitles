遵命  小姐
Yes, my lady.

17
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,820
对这"春光"还满意吗
Do you enjoy the view?

18
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,480
小姐
Lady.

19
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,320
求您了  我求您
Please, I beg you.

20
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,300
你那脏手在玷污我的裙子之前
What were you doing with that hand

21
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,900
还做了些什么
before you used it to sully my dress?

22
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,360
敬爱的小姐  我爱您
My lady, I love you.

23
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,340
是吗
Do you?

24
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,310
你就这样证明你对我的爱意的吗
This is how you prove it?

25
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,100
我愿为您做任何事
I'll do anything.

26
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,530
任何事
Anything.

27
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,850
跟我来
Come with me.

28
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,710
告诉她你的名字
Tell her your name.

29
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,880
豪威尔
Harwel.

30
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,160
你能为我做些什么呢  豪威尔
And what have you offered me, Harwel?

31
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,320
您让我做什么我就做什么
Whatever you wish of me.

32
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,720
让他准备好
Get him prepared.

33
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,270
其他的都准备好了吗
Is everything else ready?

34
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,690
是的
Yes.

35
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,600
你确定亚瑟会来吗
You're sure that Arthur will come?

36
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,070
这个私生子内心迫切的想要一个家
His bastard's heart craves a family.

37
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,550
我不是家人又是何人呢
And what am I, if not family?

38
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,420
还有更好的方法可以进入他的内心世界吗
What better way to get inside his head?

39
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,410
把肉弄得更咸些  拿出最烈的酒
Double salt the meat and bring out the strongest ale.

40
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,470
遵命  小姐
Yes, my lady.

41
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,710
我要他们觉得口渴  我要灌醉他们
I want them thirsty and drunk.

42
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,110
我们要向亚瑟证明
We'll prove to Arthur just how loyal

43
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,210
我们无尚的忠心
and devoted we are.

44
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,590
摩根曾和杀害我们双亲的人结盟
Morgan was allied with the man who killed both our parents.

45
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,060
现在却成了我们的挚友吗
But now we're the best of friends?

46
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,600
她提醒过我们  他会来袭
She warned us of his attack.

47
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,550
若不是她  我们可能早丧命了
Without her, we could have all died.

48
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,300
我要提醒你  她城堡的宴会是鸿门宴啊
I'm warning you. A feast at her castle is a risk.

49
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,740
作为你弟弟  我告诉你要摒弃前嫌
And as your brother, I'm telling you, some wounds have to heal.

50
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,920
况且  我已和她共进过晚餐
Besides, I've already broken

51
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,030
现在仍完好无损地活着
bread with her and lived to tell the tale.

52
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,170
你怎么看
What do you think?

53
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,630
我觉得这主意不错  我很期待
I think it's a marvellous idea. I'm looking forward to it.

54
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,610
梅林都不担心  我还担心个什么劲
If Merlin's not worried, I'm not worried.

55
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,900
如果不赴约  我就搞不明白摩根的阴谋
If we don't go, I can't work out what Morgan's up to.

56
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,550
而且我很想念故土
Besides, I miss the old place,

57
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,820
享用顿美食对我们有益无害
and a feast will do us all good.

58
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,440
卡米洛特或许已有了藏书馆和军械库
Camelot might have a library and an armoury,

59
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,440
但我们还没有可坐下吃饭的餐桌
but we haven't got a table to sit at.

60
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,170
我们就这样毫不设防的离开吗
So we leave it undefended?

61
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,980
我们招募到人了
We've recruited.

62
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,050
高文训练过他们了  我们不缺精兵良将
Gawain's trained them. We don't lack good soldiers.

63
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,670
我们只缺酒
Just ale.

64
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,760
彭德拉根堡佳酿颇多
And Castle Pendragon has plenty of that.

65
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,420
喝醉前我们先好好舒展下筋骨吧
Let's get a move on before it's all been drunk!

66
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,740
-欢迎  我的国王  -我是你弟弟
- Welcome, my king. - Your brother.

67
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,500
感谢你邀请我们
Thank you for inviting us.

68
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,640
伙计们  帮忙安置马匹
Come lad, help with the horses.

69
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,780
-伊格兰王后  -拿水来
- Lady Igraine. - Get the water.

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,580
旧地重游定让您回忆起往昔时光吧
Must bring back memories.

71
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,950
很抱歉当初赶你走
I'm sorry for the way that you left.

72
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,980
真的吗
Really?

73
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,840
我希望能弥补当初错误的决定
I had time to requite some of my decisions.

74
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,170
希望您能原谅我
I hope you can forgive me.

75
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,880
彼此彼此
So do I.

76
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,490
大家快请  美味佳肴等着呢
Please. Refreshment awaits!

77
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,780
梅林  很高兴你能来
Merlin. Glad you could come.

78
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,810
重回旧地之邀  我怎会错过
I'd never miss an invite to the old place.

79
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,470
都准备了什么佳肴
Whatcha you cooking?

80
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,150
你肯定不想坐这里吧
This is the last place you wanted to sit.

81
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,230
你什么意思
What do you mean?

82
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,640
几天来  你一直在回避我
You've been avoiding me for days.

83
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,550
我听不到他们在说什么
I can't hear what they're saying.

84
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,920
她的厨房里是不是有人
Does she have someone out back turning water

85
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,780
-能点水成酒啊  -真有意思
- into all this wine? - That's very funny.

86
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,650
天知道我有多久没见过
I haven't seen a spread this good since...

87
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,270
这样的盛况了
God knows.

88
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,750
上帝知道  布拉提斯  他看着呢
Yes, he does, Brastias, and he's watching.

89
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,050
我们齐聚彭德拉根堡
We have all come together here at Castle Pendragon

90
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,150
化干戈为玉帛
to heal old wounds

91
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,440
在国王  亚瑟的领导下
and promote a new future for the land under our king,

92
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,880
共建美好未来
Arthur.

93
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,550
亲爱的弟弟  尊敬的国王
Brother and King, I stand here

94
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,920
作为你的姐姐  你的忠臣
as your sister and loyal subject,

95
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,120
我在此向你表达我对你的爱和忠诚
offering my love and devotion.

96
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,410
敬国王
The king!

97
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,160
敬国王
The king!

98
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,880
你相信她吗
Do you believe her?

99
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,950
我也想啊
I'd love to.

100
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,070
她会令我们如虎添翼
She'd make our endeavour so much stronger.

101
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,530
我无法单枪匹马为这片土地带来和平
I cannot bring peace to this land alone.

102
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,650
我需要盟友  需要家人
I will need my allies and my family.

103
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,530
我向你致敬  摩根
I salute you, Morgan,

104
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,580
我的姐姐  我的盟友
as a sister and an ally.

105
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,340
敬摩根
To Morgan!

106
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,400
敬摩根
To Morgan!

107
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,690
她觊觎亚瑟的王位
She covets Arthur's throne.

108
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,920
她声明...   不再争夺王位了
She claims... not anymore.

109
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,600
你相信她吗
You trust her?

110
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,790
现在
And now...

111
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,710
来点娱乐活动吧
...for some entertainment!

112
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,320
-亚瑟  -殿下
- Arthur! - Highness!

113
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,660
你还好吧
Are you all right?

114
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,760
真精彩
Brilliant.

115
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,800
请尽情享受彭德拉根堡的热情款待
Enjoy the hospitality of Castle Pendragon

116
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,860
不要拘泥于形式
in all its forms.

117
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,890
不介意的话  我先失陪了
Don't mind if I do.

118
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,000
高文  还等什么呢
Gawain, what are you waiting for?

119
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,910
去吧
It's fine.

120
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,490
希望您理解  我得拒绝您的好意
You'll understand if I... decline.

121
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,650
-当然  -那让他们都来这吧
- Of course. - Ah, send 'em this way.

122
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,620
不能浪费了这美意
We'll see they don't go to waste.

123
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,040
国王不想找人陪陪吗
Does the king not wish some company?

124
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,070
我有这桌上的人陪我就足够了
I'm very happy with the company around this table.

125
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,350
她们当然不会合所有男人的胃口
They can't feed all of a man's appetites, surely.

126
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,050
你还没有王后
You don't have a queen.

127
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,310
你是个国王  不是个牧师
You're a king, not a priest.

128
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,010
我羡慕你  桂妮维尔
I envy you, Guinevere.

129
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,100
你找到了可以托付真心的男人
You've found a man to whom you can give your whole heart.

130
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,430
我也把心都交给了她
And who has given her his.

131
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,740
我很幸运
I'm very lucky.

132
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,000
发信号
Give the signal.

133
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,780
每座城堡都该有个修女当宠物养着
I think every castle should have a pet nun.

134
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,260
她需要一个家
She needed a home.

135
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,630
于是病患和困苦者的保护人摩根就接纳了她
So Morgan, protector of the sick and needy, took her in.

136
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,550
你美名远扬啊
Your reputation grows.

137
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,600
我吸取了教训
I've learned my lesson.

138
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,910
只为野心而奋斗是没有意义的
Ambition for its own sake is worthless.

139
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,200
你更愿做个贴心的女王
You'd rather be a Queen of Hearts.

140
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,660
卡米洛特已经有一位了
Camelot has one already.

141
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,920
是啊
Indeed.

142
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,850
嘿  醒醒
Hey! Wake up!

143
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,570
管他呢
Aw, to hell with him.

144
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,310
我们不该离开国王
We should not have left the king.

145
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,040
占着茅坑就赶快拉屎
So either shit or get off the pot!

146
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,190
他没事  梅林和里昂提斯跟他在一起呢
He's fine. Merlin and Leontes are with him.

147
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,230
下次再说吧
Maybe some other time.

148
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,240
这么快就要走了么  高文
Leaving the party so soon, Gawain?

149
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,090
你尽情享用吧
You're welcome to her.

150
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,600
好啊  过来吧
Well, come on, then!

151
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,450
着火了
Fire!

152
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,840
着火了
Fire!

153
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,500
怎么了
What was that?

154
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,730
着火了  去弄水来  快
Fire! Get water! Hurry!

155
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,000
快  拿水来
Quick! Get water!

156
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,110
-怎么了  -不知道
- What is it? - I don't know.

157
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,770
去看看
Let's go.

158
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,120
再来点水
More water!

159
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,230
我们需要更多的水
We need more water now!

160
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,690
-火势在蔓延  -去拿水
- The fire's spreading. - Get water!

161
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,380
-去拿水  -去井里打
- Get water! - Water from the well!

162
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,280
-你们所有人  来帮忙  -我们走
- All of you, help! - Let's go.

163
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,390
欧菲尔斯  醒醒  醒醒  欧菲尔斯
Ulfius! Wake up! Come on, Ulfius!

164
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,950
-水  -这是什么  又是娱乐节目吗
- Water! - What is this, more entertainment?

165
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,420
快下来  快下来
Get down! Get down!

166
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,420
亚瑟  她被困住了
Arthur! She's trapped!

167
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,920
把车推过来  把那辆车推过来
Push the cart! Push the cart around!

168
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,320
凯  推啊  推到这边来
Come on, Kay! Push! Around this way!

169
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,840
举
Lift!

170
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,090
拉过来
Pull the cart!

171
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,080
-拉啊  -停下来
- Pull! - Halt!

172
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,990
把我顶上去  把我顶上去
Help lever me up! Help lever me up!

173
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,220
到后面去  后面
Round the back! Round the back!

174
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,810
你  过来帮我
You there! Help me!

175
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,710
数到三  数到三  准备好了吗
On three! On three! Are you ready?

176
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,950
好了
Ready!

177
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,420
一  二  三
One, two, three!

178
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,690
亚瑟
Arthur!

179
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,650
来  来  把车转过来
Come on. Come on. Spin the cart!

180
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,710
-当心  亚瑟  -把车转过来
- Be careful, Arthur! - Turn the cart around!

181
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
转到这边
Round this way!

182
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,880
-推啊  推啊  -向前
- Push it up! Push it up now! - Forward!

183
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,220
-接着她  -跳
- Somebody catch her! - Jump!

184
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,130
好了吗
Ready?

185
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,660
起来吧  殿下
Come on, Your Highness.

186
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,600
那真是我见过的最英勇的举动了
That was the bravest thing I've ever seen.

187
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,330
又或是最蠢的
Or the stupidest.

188
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,470
通常是一回事
They're usually one and the same.

189
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,010
你安全了
You're safe.

190
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,310
不论你们有什么防御力量
Whatever defences you have,

191
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,840
让他们马上准备好
get them prepared. Now!

192
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,990
这里  高文  快点  就这样
Here, Gawain! Come on! Yes!

193
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,470
是谁在攻击我们
Who could be attacking us?

194
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,840
是某个知道国王在此的人
Someone knows the king is here.

195
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,070
而且此人还对城堡很了解
Someone who knows this castle well.

196
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,460
应该问是哪一伙敌人
Which enemy could this be?

197
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,030
而不是某一个人
But who?

198
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,530
-可能是奥德伍夫  -谁是奥德伍夫
- It could be Aldwulf. - Who is Aldwulf?

199
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,510
东部的军阀
He's a warrior king from the east,

200
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,680
尤瑟的老对手了
an old enemy of Uther's.

201
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,410
我们交战多次  都是我们赢
We've fought many times. We've always prevailed.

202
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,660
-那他现在来干嘛  -尤瑟已死
- Well, why would he come now? - Uther's dead.

203
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,840
或许他觉得是时候来索取他一直想要的了
Maybe he sees a chance to get something he's always wanted.

204
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,510
-你是说彭德拉根城堡吗  -是领土
- Castle Pendragon? - Territory.

205
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,120
控制权
Control.

206
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,270
要是他能拿下彭德拉根的城堡
If he takes Castle Pendragon, he can move on

207
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,450
就能继而向巴尔东进发
to the Bardon Pass and control

208
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,980
并控制进出山谷的主路
the main route in and out of the valley.

209
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,300
我们所有的补给线
And all our supply routes.

210
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,720
他不放行  我们就无法进行贸易往来
There'd be no trading without his say so.

211
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,550
-卡米洛特就将任他摆布  -他要是在关口
- Camelot would be under his command. - If he held the pass

212
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,780
以重兵把守  我们永远都动不了他
with a large force, we'd never remove him.

213
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,000
我们有人把守关口吗
Do we have anyone defending the pass?

214
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,500
有个叫卢坎的农民是为彭德拉根效忠的
A farmer called Lucan flies the Pendragon colour.

215
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,250
仅此而已吗
And that's it?

216
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,950
要取下巴尔东必须从此经过
In order to take Bardon, you have to come through here.

217
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,760
要是放他们从彭德拉根城堡经过
If they left Castle Pendragon

218
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,940
我们就可以从后面攻击他们
unconquered, their whole rear would be open to assault.

219
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,290
他们是想试试我们的兵力
They want to test our strength.

220
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,730
我们的兵力都留在卡米洛特
Which is in Camelot.

221
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,170
我们的人都不在身边
Our men are not with us.

222
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,510
他大概觉得我不会妨碍他
Maybe he thinks I wouldn't stand in his way.

223
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,150
大家都知道我与先父不合  而且我是女人
Our prior differences are well known, and I'm a woman,

224
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,660
他觉得我不构成威胁
so no threat to his advance.

225
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,090
那他发现我们在这就要大吃一惊了
Well, then he's got a shock coming when he finds us waiting.

226
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,320
-我们人手不够  -亚瑟
- We're only a few. - Arthur,

227
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,030
我的人你随便用  他们都听你的
treat my men as your own. They're yours.

228
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,430
-谢谢  -你有什么人
- Thank you. - What men are they?

229
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,850
忠于尤瑟的人都跟我们去卡米洛特了
Uther's loyal subjects came with us to Camelot.

230
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,930
这些是忠于我的战士
These are warriors loyal to me.

231
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,380
-有多少  -训练精良的四十人卫戍部队
- How many? - A garrison of 40 well-trained men.

232
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,340
天啊  你还真没闲着
My, you have been busy.

233
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,750
从没有人突破彭德拉跟城堡
No one has ever breached Castle Pendragon.

234
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,950
那我们就别开这个先河
Then let's not set a precedent.

235
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,520
不  我们该立刻离开
No, we should leave now,

236
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,510
趁夜色送你回卡米洛特
get you back to Camelot under the cover of darkness.

237
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,480
我才刚刚为联合而举杯  你就让我
I've just sworn a toast to unity, and you want

238
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,270
为了个传言而扔下我姐姐任人宰割吗
to leave my sister vulnerable because of a rumour?

239
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,420
凯是对的  你得活下去
Kay is right. You must survive.

240
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,820
奥德伍夫攻击的  并非你的城堡
It's not your home under Aldwulf attacks.

241
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,500
但这里也是王土
But it is my land.

242
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,310
彭德拉根城堡在我的庇护之下
Castle Pendragon is under my protection.

243
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,750
里昂提斯
Leontes.

244
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,260
你非常了解城堡  你能负责防御吗
You know the castle well. Will you see to the defence?

245
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,300
交给我了
Leave it to me.

246
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,280
找到那些攻击者
Find the attackers,

247
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,080
探明他们的实力  马上回来
assess the weight of their forces, and return.

248
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,880
别和他们交锋
Don't engage them.

249
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,070
不管发生什么  黎明时分必须回来
Whatever happens, be back here by dawn.

250
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,780
-放心吧  -去吧
- You can depend on us. - Go!

251
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,860
有女人又有仗打
A fuck and a fight!

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,240
今夜变得如此美妙
This is turning into a good night.

253
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,610
男人对待打仗就像在玩游戏
Men treat all this like some kind of great game.

254
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
桂妮维尔  他们是战士
Guinevere, they're warriors.

255
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,330
对于战斗的期待让他们兴奋
The prospect of battle excites them.

256
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,280
怎么  难道我们就坐这里干等吗
What, and we're supposed to just sit here and wait?

257
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,340
外面有野蛮人的军队
Given an army of barbarians out there,

258
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,040
我们还能怎样
what choice do we have?

259
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,430
现在  他们脑中充斥着各种行动和计划
Right now, they are full of planning and action.

260
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,960
但很快  他们会冷静下来进行思考
But soon, they will stop and think.

261
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,760
那时他们便回到我们身边
And that's when they will come to us.

262
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,070
我们会令他们想起自己是为何而战
To remind themselves of why they will fight.

263
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,760
如果我们对他们没信心
And if we doubt them,

264
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,900
他们就会不自信
then they will doubt themselves,

265
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,220
战斗就必将失败
and the battle will be lost.

266
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,260
我们的战士很勇猛
Our champions are stout,

267
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,640
这城堡也固若金汤
and this castle is strong.

268
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,380
所以别害怕
So do not fear.

269
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,770
她们听得全神贯注
They hang on her every word.

270
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,030
你被赐予伊格兰的容貌是有原因的
You were given Igraine for a reason.

271
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,980
找我何事
Did you want something?

272
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,740
我们的人已到位
Our people are in position.

273
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,350
不  不  它们太长了
No, no! They're too long!

274
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,780
这些矛对于近战来说都太长了
These spears are all too long for close-quarter combat.

275
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,970
是吗
Really?

276
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,670
他们会从攻城梯登上城墙
They're coming up siege ladders.

277
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,560
那他们就只能像这样挥动武器
They can only swing their weapons overhand, like so.

278
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,700
一旦他们这样做
The second they do,

279
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,140
你们就得用短矛战斗
you stab with a short spear.

280
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,040
别乱挥  你们要找准位置
And no wild swings. You get right in,

281
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,080
用力向上刺
and you drive it up!

282
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,270
把这些矛都削短一半
Cut half of these down.

283
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,600
让他们在城墙上列队防御
And line them on the walls.

284
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,700
殿下
Highness.

285
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,620
看来你挺喜欢干这些
You look like you're enjoying this.

286
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,180
比起艳舞  我更喜欢打仗
I prefer fighting over dancing.

287
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,250
高文  如果这里干完了
Gawain, if you're done here,

288
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,970
我需要你去东城墙检查一下
I need you to check the men on the east wall.

289
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,020
你现在是在命令我吗  里昂提斯
Are you giving me orders now, Leontes?

290
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,170
你以前防御过这城堡吗
Have you ever defended this castle before?

291
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,560
那就听我的命令吧
Then I'm giving you orders.

292
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,620
里昂提斯
Leontes!

293
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,770
你该待在里面
You should be inside.

294
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,520
我不能就坐着什么都不干
I cannot sit indoors and do nothing.

295
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,960
里昂提斯  让我们帮忙吧
Leontes, let us be helpful.

296
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,590
我们一定可以做些什么
There must be something we can do.

297
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,700
我们需要绷带和药品  去找些来
We need bandages and medicine. Find them.

298
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,310
还有  桂妮维尔...
And Guinevere...

299
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,060
有人告诉过你  你有多美吗
Anyone ever tell you how beautiful you are?

300
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,940
你  每天都在说
You. Every day.

301
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,190
我们需要绷带和药品
We're going to need bandages and medicine.

302
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,820
我带你去拿
Let me show you.

303
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,080
太好了  干得好  兄弟们  继续
Excellent. Well done, men. Keep going.

304
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,610
不  别都放那里
No! Not all there!

305
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,910
将它们散布于城墙上
Spread them out across the wall!

306
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,120
我们需要战士们
We need weapons at hand

307
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,070
随处可以拿到武器
wherever our warriors are positioned.

308
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,440
你还认为我们该来吗
So, you still think we should have come?

309
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,770
你为何如此多虑
Why are you so worried?

310
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,760
这正是你训练的目的  不是吗
This is what you train for, isn't it?

311
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,320
你该感激这次挑战
You should be grateful for the challenge.

312
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,570
我们尚未准备就绪
We're not prepared.

313
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,520
那就好好准备
Then get prepared.

314
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,620
那里应该是谁的防御位置
What men are supposed to be there?

315
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,550
只有你在这儿
So it's just you here,

316
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,380
独自守着城堡
alone in this castle.

317
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,980
我没觉得孤单
I don't feel alone.

318
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,440
你没想过找个丈夫吗
Do you not think about taking a husband?

319
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,590
曾经想过
I've thought about it.

320
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,800
但我能从中得到什么呢
What would I gain from it?

321
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,240
爱情啊  那不是人人都想要的吗
Love. Isn't that what everyone wants?

322
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,120
手握他人之心
Isn't it a burden to

323
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,360
难道不是种负担吗
hold another's heart in your hands?

324
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,330
那是种荣幸
It's a privilege.

325
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,130
如果你伤了他的心呢
What if you damage it?

326
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,130
你不会那样做
Well, you mustn't.

327
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,220
因为那是种信任
That's the trust.

328
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,420
你觉得国王怎么样
How do you feel about the king?

329
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,330
你指哪方面
What do you mean?

330
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,030
他是个贤明的君主吗
Does he make a good ruler?

331
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,630
你丈夫是否像信任我父亲那样  信任他呢
Does your husband believe in him as he did my father?

332
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,250
我想是的  他是个好人
I think so. He's a good man.

333
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,940
也很帅
And handsome!

334
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,950
很帅吗
Is he?

335
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,520
你知道的
You know he is.

336
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,250
可能吧
I suppose.

337
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,340
但我结婚了  不会过于关注
But I'm married, so I don't look.

338
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,430
他会垂青于某位幸运女子
Someone is going to be very lucky.

339
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,370
我肯定他不久便会迎娶一位王后
I'm sure he won't be without a queen for long.

340
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,910
彭德拉根的修女
The Pendragon nun.

341
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,530
希望没打扰你
I've been hoping to bump into you.

342
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,590
你怎么上来了
Should you be up here?

343
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,060
怎么了
Why?

344
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,490
我不该来这里吗
Are there places I shouldn't be?

345
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,130
听说你很了解这古堡
I hear you know this castle of old.

346
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,070
这与建筑无关
It's never the buildings.

347
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,860
建筑里的人所做之事
It's what people do inside them

348
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,550
才是关键
that matters.

349
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,860
一个修女会来这里  真是有趣
Funny place for a woman of faith.

350
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,490
哪里都需要信仰
Faith is needed everywhere.

351
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,560
我想你的女主人将信仰倾注于更加...
I think your mistress puts her faith in more...

352
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,970
...原始的力量了
...primal forces.

353
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,500
她从修道院带回了点...
She came back from the nunnery with some...

354
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,280
并非基督徒的
interesting talents

355
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,830
有趣的才能
not particularly Christian.

356
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,330
现在你又出现在这里
And now here you are.

357
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,020
你发誓永不泄密了吗
Did you take a vow of silence?

358
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,890
我需要避难之所
I needed sanctuary,

359
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,180
于是摩根提供给了我
and Morgan gave it.

360
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,090
那她能得到何种回报
And what she get in return?

361
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,100
有人过来了
There's someone coming.

362
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,170
看起来他好像受伤了
It looks like he's wounded.

363
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,350
打开城门
Open the gates!

364
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,120
帮我扶他下马
Help me get him down!

365
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,800
欧菲尔斯  快点
Ulfius! Come on.

366
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,660
带他进屋
Get him inside.

367
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,350
带他进屋  快走
Get him inside! Move!

368
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,950
回到各自岗位
Back to your posts!

369
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,710
是谁
Who is it?

370
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,800
是侦察兵
It's the scout.

371
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,310
出什么事了
What happened?

372
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,660
一群士兵正在做进攻准备
A host of men making preparation for an attack.

373
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,110
谁的
Whose?

374
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,540
-谁的兵  -奥德伍夫
- Whose men? - Aldwulf's.

375
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,830
在哪
Where?

376
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,610
正向东袭来  即刻便到
To the east. They will come soon.

377
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,630
有多少人
How many?

378
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,900
足以踏平这里
The castle will be crushed.

379
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,990
我们已做好准备
We're prepared.

380
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,100
不必惊慌
Nothing's changed.

381
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,290
你做得很好
You did well.

382
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,770
-开门  -跟上
- Open! - Come on!

383
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,230
-不  等等  -这是干什么
- No!! Wait!! - What are they doing?!

384
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,250
谁让他们出城的
Who gave the order for them to ride out?!

385
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,080
是我
I did.

386
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,330
如果我们能攻其不备
If we can attack them before their plans are complete,

387
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,170
我的人便能奇袭得手
my men will have the element of surprise.

388
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,300
这样的蠢事你也做得出来
That was the stupidest thing you could have done!

389
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,900
我们还不知他们的战术
We have no idea what those plans are.

390
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,100
-简直是自寻死路  -高文  够了
- It's tactical suicide! - Gawain, enough!

391
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,540
是我考虑不周  亚瑟
I'm sorry, Arthur.

392
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,280
现在开始从长计议
So now we take a different strategy.

393
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,170
我们要同心协力
Plan and work together.

394
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,270
-大家速速归位  -进去
- Back to your posts, men. - Back inside.

395
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,190
关城门
Seal the gates.

396
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,990
现在我们还有二十多个人手
So we have about 20, 25 able-bodied men.

397
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,200
-这点人不够守卫整个城墙  -知道了
- That's not enough to defend the entire perimeter. - OK.

398
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,000
假设他迎头攻上  我们要集中火力
Well, say he comes at us head-on. We concentrate our forces

399
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,550
守住城门  制造人手众多的假象
at the gate, making them seem more than they are.

400
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,630
如果他从后方进攻呢
And if he attacks from the rear?

401
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,130
那我们便从前方折到后方
Then we make a run for it from the front.

402
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,030
梅林  还有什么要补充吗
Merlin, anything to add?

403
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,750
那好  行动吧
Right. Let's get to it.

404
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,680
我这儿还有一计
There's another tactic.

405
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,530
我的人可暂时拖住他们
My attack would provide a diversion

406
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,710
你们可以乘机回城
and you could make it home.

407
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,720
那你这里岂不成了空城一座
Leaving you totally defenceless.

408
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,950
我若逃了  一切努力都将前功尽弃
If I ran, everything we're working for would be over.

409
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,030
没到身首异处的境地就不会前功尽弃
It's over if your head's stuck on a pike.

410
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,850
你或许该接受摩根的好意
Maybe you should take Morgan up on her kind offer.

411
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,710
既然还有二十五人可用  那就全力应战
If 25 men is all we have, then we'll have to make do with that.

412
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,250
还有我们
You have us.

413
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,090
我们也能打仗
We can fight.

414
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,240
不  不  不行
No. No, that's not gonna happen.

415
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,640
可你们一旦失利
And if you fall?

416
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,610
我们岂有善终
What of our fate?

417
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,420
战场可不是女人该去的地方
The battlement is no place for women.

418
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,960
我可不想守在屋里等着被蹂躏
I am not hiding indoors awaiting to be raped.

419
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,830
我宁愿手持长剑死战死沙场
I'd rather die with a sword in my hand.

420
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,940
她说得对
She's right.

421
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,220
大家都是一条船上的人
We're all in this together.

422
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,080
-陛下  -让她们自己决定命运
- Your Majesty-- - Let them decide their own fate.

423
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,200
如果她们会射箭掷矛  还是能帮上忙的
And if they can pull a bow or throw a spear, then we need them.

424
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,860
关键是瞄准
It's all about the position.

425
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,640
要稳住
You need to keep it stiff.

426
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,150
向后拉  把握好发射时机
Pull back, and know when it's time to release.

427
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,830
他就没个正经时候
Does he take nothing seriously?

428
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,180
笑着死哭着死都一样
I can die laughing, or I can die crying.

429
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,280
反正我是死定了
The only certain thing is I'm going to die.

430
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,320
梅林质疑我了
Merlin was asking about me.

431
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,320
他怀疑我和你的巫术有关联
He suspects me of having a hand in your powers.

432
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,700
他很聪明
He's clever.

433
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,810
可亚瑟相信我是真心对他好
But Arthur wants to believe in my love.

434
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,110
我本来想着  "去赴个宴
Here was me thinking, "Go to a feast!

435
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,820
跳跳舞  再邂逅一个
"Have a dance, meet a man--

436
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,050
风度翩翩的美男"  结果呢
a decent one with manners". Now look at me.

437
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,450
现在自己却小命难保
I've even got to save myself from a fate worse than death.

438
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,280
我会保护你
I'll look after you.

439
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,000
放低弓箭时  将手臂伸直
Keep your left arm straight as you lower the arrow...

440
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,650
-好箭法  -这可不是猎兔子
- She's good. - We're not hunting rabbits.

441
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,380
当然  猎的是人
No, men.

442
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,690
靶子更大  跑得更慢
And they're bigger, and slower.

443
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,160
这些小把戏有什么用
What use is all this?

444
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,050
奥德伍夫大军一来  都无济于事
When Aldwulf arrives with his forces, it's over.

445
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,020
也许  静观其效吧
Maybe. We'll wait and see.

446
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,170
如果能让他们在这里待到明早
If we can keep them all inside till morning,

447
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,370
那些人便不会再怀疑我有二心
the others will be certain of my loyalty.

448
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,190
-那梅林呢  -也没事
- And Merlin? - Won't matter.

449
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,680
他会以为就算我有野心
He'll think we pose no military threat,

450
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,440
没有兵力也不成气候
whatever my ambitions.

451
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,370
男人啊
Men.

452
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,330
再聪明的人也无法否认兵力决定一切
Even the clever ones think that armies decide everything.

453
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,560
希望如此
Let's hope so.

454
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,410
等待可不是战术
Waiting is no strategy for war.

455
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,120
-你不一起吗  -不
- You're not joining in? - Hm! No.

456
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,320
我知道自己不会有任何帮助
I know I'd make no difference.

457
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,910
但如果这样能让他们忘记将要面临的血战
But if it keeps their minds off what...

458
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,200
也未尝不是好事
...might come, then good.

459
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,410
我相信亚瑟和他的护卫们
I'll put my faith in Arthur and his champions.

460
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,670
你觉得...
Do you think...

461
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,450
一个人能够改变本性
...it's possible to rise above your beginnings?

462
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,920
变得更好吗
To be better than your blood?

463
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,230
摩根  你是真的改过了么
Have you really changed, Morgan?

464
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,600
你比谁都清楚  过去无法改变
You know better than anyone that we can't change the past,

465
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,530
只能弥补
only atone for it.

466
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,230
我会向大家证明自己
I will prove myself to you all.

467
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,980
我保证
I promise.

468
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,550
-我做得怎样  -很好
- How did I do? - You did well.

469
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,970
这是我忠诚的印记
A mark of my devotion.

470
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,700
仅以此表示我的谢意
A symbol of my gratitude.

471
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,820
你要走
Are you leaving?

472
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,600
我要去找奥德伍夫
I'm going to go and find Aldwulf.

473
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,380
亲手杀了他
And kill him myself.

474
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,110
这是我听过最蠢的事了
That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard.

475
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,290
你想就这样坐等奥德伍夫攻破城门么
You'd rather wait until Aldwulf is upon the gates?

476
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,400
国王已经下令  我们有责任服从
The king has given us his orders. It's our duty to follow.

477
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
你倒是责任重大
You and your duty--

478
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,870
要服从国王
to the king,

479
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,350
要善待妻子
to your wife,

480
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,010
还要敬奉上帝
to God.

481
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,990
你哪来的那么多时间啊
How do you find time in the day?

482
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,080
-你这是嫉妒  -嫉妒你
- You sound jealous. - Of you?

483
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,010
你为何执意要出去
Why are you so keen to go out there?

484
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,300
这无异于自投罗网
It's a suicide mission.

485
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,220
自投罗网
Suicide?

486
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,530
等待才是自投罗网
Waiting is suicide.

487
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,200
我宁愿战死也不愿等待
And I'd rather fight than wait.

488
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,950
即便要死
If I'm going to die,

489
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,260
我也要自己选择死法
it'll be on my own terms.

490
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,600
你哪儿都不能去  这是命令
You're not going anywhere. That's an order.

491
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,440
别动不动拿命令压我
I've told you about giving me orders.

492
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,000
-让我走  -我不会放你走的
- Now leave me be. - I'll not let you go.

493
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,440
你阻止不了我
You couldn't stop me.

494
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,730
为何你总是要唱反调
Why does everything with you have to be a confrontation?

495
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,550
国王需要你留在这里
The king needs you here.

496
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,950
你话太多了  里昂提斯
You talk too much, Leontes.

497
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,130
一如你的经文
Like your Scriptures--

498
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,190
字太多
too many words.

499
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,130
回去
Go back inside.

500
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,400
你知道你赢不了我
You know you can't beat me.

501
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,320
我不需要赢你
I don't have to.

502
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,980
你说自己不需要别人  并非如此吧
You say you need no one. That's not true, is it?

503
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,060
-闭嘴  -事实是
- Shut up. - The truth is...

504
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,730
你不会和人相处
you can't handle your own company.

505
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,380
你不了解我
You don't know me.

506
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,430
我了解你
I do,

507
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,180
因为在你身上  我看见了自己的影子
because when I look at you, I see myself!

508
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,610
这是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?!

509
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,510
我发现他想离开
I found him trying to leave!

510
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,900
是真的吗
Is this true?

511
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,940
回答我
Answer your king!

512
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,300
我想自己去攻打奥德伍夫
I wanted to face Aldwulf myself.

513
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,670
你训练我们
You trained us.

514
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,080
我听取了你的训导  现在你得听我的
I listened to you. Now you listen to me.

515
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,490
你不能一人孤身杀敌
You're not fighting on your own.

516
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,330
我们在这里集结
We are banded together here.

517
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,740
团结成一个整体  没人例外
We stand as one. No exceptions.

518
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,640
没人例外
No exceptions.

519
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,870
现在各就各位  保持警惕
Now man the battlements, and keep watch.

520
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,030
走吧  护卫
Come along, champion.

521
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,750
你相信她吗
Do you believe her?

522
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,430
你明显怀疑
You obviously doubt.

523
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,150
你自诩学富五车  料事如神
I know you're the self-appointed font of all knowledge,

524
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,900
却没料到这个  是吧
but you didn't see this coming, did you?

525
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,740
我们不知道这是什么
We don't know what this is.

526
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,270
暂时还不知道
Not yet.

527
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,810
你怀疑奥德伍夫真在外面吗
So you doubt that Aldwulf is out there?

528
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,750
我怀疑一切
I doubt everything.

529
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:44,610
是啊  还怀疑每个人
Hm! Yes, and everyone.

530
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,900
为什么
Why?

531
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,210
想知道我在想什么吗
You want to get inside my head? Hmm?

532
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,020
想见我所见吗
See what I see? Hmm?

533
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,570
是的
Yes.

534
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,930
你以为知识就是力量
You think knowledge is power.

535
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,930
知识其实是痛苦
Knowledge is pain.

536
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,400
你想要吗
Do you want this?

537
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,660
让我们共同分担
Share your burden.

538
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,390
摩根杀了尤瑟
Morgan killed Uther.

539
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,060
用的毒
Poisoned him.

540
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,090
他拒绝了她
He rejected her,

541
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,380
所以她就杀了他
and she killed him.

542
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,160
帮帮我们
Help us!

543
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,280
那不是真的
That can't be true.

544
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,590
你的表情说明你知道那是真的
The look on your face tells me you know it is.

545
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,530
你瞒着我
You kept this from me?

546
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,650
你还瞒着什么事
What else are you holding back?

547
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,290
很多事
Plenty.

548
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,570
但你不能告诉亚瑟
But you can't tell Arthur.

549
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,380
他身处险境
He's in danger.

550
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,840
若摩根想杀他
If Morgan wanted to kill him,

551
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,790
她现在已经得手了
she would have done it by now.

552
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,760
我们是他的力量和保护伞
We are his strength and protection.

553
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,600
他得知这事不会有好处的
No good will come of his knowing.

554
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,600
上帝
Father God,

555
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,320
今晚请派您的天使与我们一起
send your angels to be with us this night.

556
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,440
掩护我们的...
Cover our--

557
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,810
抱歉打扰了
I'm sorry.

558
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,190
你想一个人呆着吗
Did you want to be alone?

559
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,340
今晚没人会想独处  不是吗
That's the last thing any of us want tonight, isn't it?

560
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,730
-信仰能抚慰你吗  -是的
- Your faith comforts you?  - It does.

561
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,300
当我们在这样的夜晚  被疑惑缠身
A good thing on a night like this,

562
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,940
信仰是不错的选择
when doubts assail us.

563
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,660
上帝给我了我所愿的一切
God has given me all I could want.

564
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,820
他也可以轻易收回
He could take it from me just as easily.

565
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:59,250
他为何要收回  你是如此虔诚
Why would he? You are so devoted.

566
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,870
如果那虔诚受到了考验呢
What if that devotion were tested?

567
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,940
如果明天我就要失去朋友和爱人呢
If tomorrow saw me losing friends and loved ones?

568
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,410
那不是虔诚信仰的定义吗
Is that not the definition of true faith?

569
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,570
你害怕会失去什么吗
You fear that something will be taken from you?

570
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,760
我半夜醒来  感觉冰冷
I wake at night, cold,

571
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,840
害怕会失去桂妮维尔
fearing that Guinevere will be taken from me.

572
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,370
这是对我罪孽的惩罚
Retribution for my sins.

573
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,690
我担忧的不是你对上帝的信仰
It's not your faith in God I'd worry about,

574
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,680
而是你错信他人
but your faith in man.

575
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,720
听着  你有护卫
Listen to me. You have champions--

576
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,650
凯  里昂提斯
Kay, Leontes.

577
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,210
你无须孤军奋战
You do not have to do this alone.

578
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,610
我不能躲在他们身后
I cannot hide behind them.

579
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,560
让他们照顾你并非躲避
It isn't hiding to let them care for you.

580
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,350
而是爱护
To love you.

581
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,240
我花了很长时间才找到你
It's taken me so long to find you,

582
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,050
我现在不能失去你
I can't bear the thought of losing you now.

583
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,990
你无需证明你对我的爱
You do not need to prove your love to me.

584
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,060
我知道的
I know it.

585
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,970
我也爱你
And I return it.

586
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,660
你不仅是我母亲  更是卡米洛特的母亲
You're not just a mother to me, but to all of Camelot.

587
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,790
亚瑟  你要去哪里
Arthur, where are you going?

588
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,020
今晚要把一切说清楚
Tonight is not a night to leave things unsaid.

589
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,190
知道吗  我刚才真想杀了你
You know I wanted to kill you back there?

590
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,320
我发现了
I noticed.

591
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,280
你身手不错
You fought well.

592
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,740
我无法打败你
I couldn't beat you.

593
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,740
这是好事  真的
It's a good thing, really.

594
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,140
我以前战无不胜
I always could before.

595
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,220
这是信仰给你的力量吗
Is that what faith gives you?

596
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,720
我长年浴血奋战
I spent years bathed in blood.

597
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,780
男人之战  感觉是种荣誉
Man versus man. It felt like it had honour.

598
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,710
直到有一天的战事中
Then one day we rode into battle.

599
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,710
我们黎明时分进入一个村庄  战事激烈
We entered a village at dawn; the fighting was fierce,

600
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,980
我对付一个战士
and I took arms against a warrior.

601
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,320
正当我把他击倒在地时
Just as I flung him to the ground,

602
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,450
另一个人跳上了我的背
another jumped on my back. I...

603
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,520
我毫不犹豫把他扔在地上
I didn't even think. I just threw him to the floor

604
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,560
一剑刺中了他
and I drove my sword through him.

605
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,410
但这战士不是成人  只是个小孩
Except the warrior wasn't a man; it was a boy,

606
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,550
不足12岁
no more than 12.

607
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,340
他甚至还拿不起剑
He could barely lift the sword that he held.

608
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:07,050
我看见他母亲对儿子之死伤心欲绝
And I watched his mother, all that pain and grief for her son.

609
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,300
那晚还是如常举行庆功宴
That night we feasted to our victory as usual,

610
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,460
但我毫无感觉
and I felt nothing.

611
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,610
那天午夜后  我
Later on in the middle of the night I...

612
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,400
我祈祷了
I prayed.

613
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,750
我祈求上帝原谅我
I asked God to forgive me.

614
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,910
他原谅你了吗
Did he?

615
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,010
-能跟你聊聊吗  -你不该来这里
- Can I speak to you? - You shouldn't be in here.

616
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,980
我要说的话不能被外人知晓
What I need to say cannot be said in public.

617
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,960
那你就该绝口不提
Then you shouldn't be saying it to me at all.

618
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,410
我们之间的...
How it was...

619
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,720
感觉  我以前从没意识到
...between us. I've never known that before.

620
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,390
从没有过那样的感觉
Never felt like that.

621
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,450
够了
Stop.

622
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,930
请让我说完
Please!

623
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,530
我对明日之战没有把握
I don't know if we can prevail tomorrow.

624
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,470
亚瑟
Arthur.

625
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,340
明天也许会成为我们生命的终结点
Tomorrow could be the end of all of us,

626
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,390
我不想带着满腹心事死去
and I don't want to die without having said this.

627
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,760
里昂提斯是我的护卫
Leontes is my champion.

628
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,540
我尊敬他  我永远不会
I honour him, and would never do anything

629
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,420
做出破坏你们婚姻的事
to break your marriage.

630
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,800
但我要你知道
But I need you to know...

631
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,660
我爱你
...I love you.

632
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,320
你走吧
Go.

633
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,510
求你
Please.

634
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,290
奥德伍夫  你个狗杂种
Ardulf, you bog-dwelling inbred!

635
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,390
等你跟你姐姐交媾完
When you're finished interfering with your sister,

636
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,100
来挑战彭德拉根的男人们试试吧
come and have a go at the men of Pendragon!

637
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,410
-懦夫  -很久以前
- Cowards!  - Long long ago in this...

638
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,280
-奥德伍夫  -在这古老的土地上
- Ardulf!  - ...ancient land

639
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:44,370
两山之间  战事突发
A battle took place where 2 hills now stand

640
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,950
尸横遍野
And on the plain

641
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,160
血流成河
There lay the slain

642
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:56,400
生灵涂炭  胜者尤败
For neither the battle was won

643
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:06,200
里昂提斯爱桂妮维尔胜过爱生命
Leontes loves Guinevere more than life itself.

644
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,240
她是他的全部未来
She is the future he pins all his hopes upon.

645
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,680
卡米洛特的希望则寄托在了亚瑟身上
And Camelot's hopes rest on Arthur's honour.

646
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,440
亚瑟和他护卫间的隔阂
A wedge between Arthur and his champion

647
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,360
能毁掉一切
could bring it all down.

648
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,850
他们都对伊格兰夫人信任有加
And they all confide in the Lady Igraine.

649
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,600
万事已备
I have what I need.

650
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,430
你确定你想这么做吗
Are you sure this is what you want?

651
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,850
你说过我被赐予这能力是有原因的
You said I'd been given the gift for a reason.

652
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,150
现在我知道原因何在了
Now I know what it is.

653
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,600
-骑士  -有骑士过来了
- Riders! - Riders approaching!

654
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,730
他们回来了
The men return!

655
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,080
发生了何事
What happened?

656
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,520
其他人呢
Where are the others?

657
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,550
死了
Dead.

658
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,240
只剩了我们几个
We are all that remain.

659
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,310
我说了这是胡来
I told you this was madness!

660
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,550
敌军情况如何  离你们还有多远
And what of the enemy, how far behind you?

661
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,530
他们走了
They are gone.

662
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,190
-去哪了  巴尔东吗  -听他说完
- Gone where? To Bardon Pass? - Let him speak.

663
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,430
他们走了  我们战胜了他们
They're gone. We defeated them.

664
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,460
什么
You did what?

665
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,280
我们突袭了他们
We took them by surprise.

666
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,970
战斗很惨烈
The fighting was vicious.

667
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,550
其他战士们呢
Where are the rest of your comrades?

668
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,150
在战斗中牺牲了
Fallen on the battlefield.

669
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,710
全部吗
All of them?

670
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,260
奥德伍夫死了吗  可否见到他的尸体
Is Aldwulf dead? Did you claim his body?

671
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,030
有几个人逃走了
The last few fled.

672
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,610
我们无力再追了
We had no men left to follow.

673
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,960
你们做得很好
You have done well.

674
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,850
你们做出了巨大的牺牲
The sacrifice you have made is huge.

675
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,700
我的人以为彭德拉根而战为豪
My men are proud to fight under the Pendragon banner.

676
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,460
姐姐
Sister.

677
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,260
我们都欠你的情
We are in your debt.

678
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,630
但你的人元气大伤  希望你能
But with your men so weakened, maybe you should accompany us

679
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,560
跟我们一起回卡米洛特
back to Camelot.

680
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,730
我们还要为勇士们准备葬礼
We have brave men to bury.

681
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,480
我的根在这里
My place is here.

682
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,470
-太可笑了  -你是说你很遗憾
- What a tease. - So what you're saying is

683
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,450
我们没去参加那必死无疑的战斗
you're disappointed we didn't face certain death?

684
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,970
我是说  我很遗憾自己完全错过了那战斗
What I'm saying is, I'm sad I missed the fight completely.

685
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,390
摩根的人取得了一场辉煌的胜利
Morgan's men have claimed a famous victory.

686
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,620
她的传奇有又新料了
Her legend grows.

687
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,310
你怀疑她
You doubt her?

688
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,650
没有他不怀疑的人  他就这样
He doubts everyone. It's his way.

689
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,550
总是一副高深莫测的样子
Keep up the whole inscrutable man of magic thing.

690
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,760
我只是觉得死要见尸
I just want to see the dead bodies.

691
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,380
我们熬过了这个夜晚  我很欣慰
I'm relieved we all made it out of this night.

692
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,960
是的
Yes.

693
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,800
他们都等着呢  不如...
Uh, they're all waiting, so...

694
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,200
你究竟有何魔力
What is it about you?

695
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,690
你这张脸为何能让男人们甘愿沉沦
What is it about that face that makes men weak?

696
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,420
准备好了吗
Are we ready?

697
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,470
好了  我只是...
Yes. I just wanted...

698
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,080
想再看这地方最后一眼
...one last look at the place.

699
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,370
你怀念这里
You miss it?

700
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,580
不
No.

701
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,860
我已经有新家了
I've got a new home now.

702
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,400
卡米洛特
Camelot.

703
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,300
有何指示
What are the orders?

704
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,250
去召集一些人
You are to recruit some men--

705
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,860
不是我们的人
not ours--

706
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,260
要找其他对亚瑟心怀不满的人
others disaffected with Arthur.

707
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,330
去袭击巴尔东的边区村落
You will attack the outpost at Bardon Pass.

708
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,490
这能把国王引过去
This will draw out the king.

709
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,800
别给他留机会
Offer him no quarter.

710
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:13,300
我要摩根亲自对我下令
I want to hear that from Morgan herself.

711
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,630
我已经把命令传达给你了
You're hearing it from me.

712
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,530
需要我告诉她你拒绝了吗
Or shall I tell her that you refuse?

713
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,980
我会做的
I'll do it.

714
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,760
你没事吧
Are you all right?

715
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,470
没事  只是有点累
Fine. Just weary.

716
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,250
昨晚是个漫长之夜
It was a long night.

717
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,170
修女
Oh, Sister.

718
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,430
我知道这都是摩根的命令
I know that this is Morgan's bidding.

719
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:09,060
放我走  我保证你不会受到责罚
Let me go and I will make sure that you are not punished.

720
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,370
你真以为
Do you really think

721
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,350
国王不会在意我去了哪吗
that the king will not wonder where I am?

722
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,360
他不会发现的
I know he won't.

723
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,520
回家真好
It's good to be home.

724
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,610
是啊
Yes.

725
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,230
真好
It is.
