00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,190
上帝  请赐予你衷心的仆人安息
O Lord, grant eternal rest and let everlasting

17
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,700
让永恒之光照耀她
light shine upon your servant here

18
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,100
将她从永恒的死亡中解救出来
and deliver her from eternal death in that awful day,

19
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,250
她当天的遭遇堪令天地震颤
when the heavens and the earth shall be shaken

20
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,250
请以地狱之火来审判这个世界  阿门
and thou shalt come to judge the world by fire. Amen.

21
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,400
阿门
Amen.

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,910
等等
Wait.

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,300
这是我的错
It's my fault.

24
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,250
-不是的  -事实如此
- No.   - But it is.

25
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,760
别让这种情绪掌控你
Don't let it rule you.

26
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,420
洛特杀她就是为了让你屈服
Lot murdered her so you would buckle.

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,870
要化悲痛为力量
Take what you're feeling and use it as fuel.

28
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,780
我们会成功的
We'll make this right.

29
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,020
但你不能分心  现在正直危急关头
But you can't be distracted; there's too much at stake.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,470
我们得立即返回卡米洛特
We need to return to Camelot now.

31
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,950
不行
No.

32
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,260
不要
No!

33
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,470
我想...独自和她待一会儿
I want to stay with her... on my own.

34
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,170
给你个命令  好好部署我们的防御
I'm giving you an order. Plan my defences.

35
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,080
我会在日落前回来
I'll return before sundown.

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,670
现在让我安静的待会儿
Now leave me to make my peace.

37
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,940
你用这把剑杀过多少人
How many have you killed with this?

38
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,800
你觉得我会数吗
You think I keep count?

39
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,610
你又在想亚瑟那小子了  是吧
You're thinking about the boy again, aren't you?

40
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,070
我以为他听懂我的警告了
I thought he understood my warning.

41
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,510
你给过他机会了
You gave him a chance.

42
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,990
我们做得很公正  别再想了
You were fair. Don't brood.

43
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,970
她是他母亲
She was his mother.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,960
他还有个备用的  不是吗
He has a spare, doesn't he?

45
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,900
还记得你父母是什么时候过世的吗
Do you remember when your parents died?

46
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,950
当然  是我杀了他们
Yes. I killed them.

47
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,380
现在我们是要哀悼通往胜利路上的尸体
Now are we going to mourn the corpse that gave us the victory,

48
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,610
还是要庆祝我们联盟的雄厚力量呢
or celebrate the strength of our unity.

49
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,700
很快  那小子就会消失
Soon, the boy will be gone,

50
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,860
你我就将登上王位
and you and I will have the throne.

51
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,370
我们得迅速行动起来
We need to move fast.

52
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,890
离洛特王进攻还有四天时间
We now have four dawns before King Lot will attack.

53
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,310
要加强防御体系的方方面面
Strengthen every aspect of our defences.

54
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,910
在所有出入口加派守卫
More guards at all exits and entrances.

55
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,400
盘问所有不认识的人
Challenge anyone you don't recognize.

56
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,840
不要相信任何人
Trust no one.

57
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,190
我们没有足够的兵力
We don't have enough forces.

58
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,060
我会解决
Leave that to me.

59
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,670
你们当前的首要任务就是保护亚瑟
As of now, you have one single priority, protect Arthur.

60
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,760
保护你们未来的国王
Protect your future king.

61
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,790
你这是干嘛
What're you doing?

62
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,460
你刚才盯着我看
You were staring at me.

63
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,250
我来这里就是不想被人盯着看
And this is where I go not to be stared at!

64
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,530
我可以解释
I can explain.

65
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,980
继续说
Go on then.

66
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,230
我做了个梦
I had a dream.

67
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,640
可能是幻想...是你从海里走出来的景象
Maybe a vision... of you... walking out of the sea.

68
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,910
少来
No!

69
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,710
我很清楚这里现在的情况
I know what goes on around these lands now.

70
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,850
你休想动我一分
And you are not going to lay a finger on me.

71
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,840
不管这里有什么情况
Whatever's going on round here,

72
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,400
我都没有参与  我发誓
I'm not a part of it, I swear.

73
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,150
我是逃避到这里来的
I came to get away.

74
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,370
然后你...出现了
And then you ... appeared.

75
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,510
逃避什么
Get away from what?

76
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,910
我刚安葬了我母亲  在上面的山上
I buried my mother. On the hill above.

77
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,020
她昨天被杀害了
She was murdered yesterday.

78
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,160
不信的话  你可以去看看坟墓
You can go see the grave if you don't believe me.

79
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,010
她怎么过世的
How did she die?

80
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,870
一个叫洛特的军阀杀了她
A warrior called Lot killed her.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,390
为什么杀她
Why did he kill her?

82
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,490
因为我杀了他儿子
I killed his son.

83
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:57,000
我明白了  接下来他会杀了你
I see. He'll come for you next.

84
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,410
我的家人  叔叔们  曾经对抗过他
My family, my uncles, they stood up to him once.

85
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,530
他把他们都杀了  他不会收手的
He killed them all. He won't stop.

86
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,830
所以我必须比他强大
So I must be stronger than him.

87
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,640
不可能
You can't be.

88
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,710
我必须做到
I have to be.

89
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,500
那个梦  梦到我的那个梦
This dream, the one I was in.

90
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,970
结果怎样
How did it end?

91
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,520
我不记得了
I can't remember.

92
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,610
亚瑟
Arthur!

93
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,530
是我父亲  我以为他们把他也杀了
It's my father. I thought they'd killed him too.

94
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,750
我得走了  很抱歉
I have to go. I'm sorry.

95
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,320
我叫亚瑟
I'm Arthur.

96
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,200
祝你好运  亚瑟
Good luck, Arthur.

97
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,520
可我还不知道你的名字
But I don't know your name.

98
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,570
是的  你不知道
No. You don't.

99
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,650
父亲
Father!

100
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,300
我以为你也死了
I thought you were dead.

101
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,170
他们俘虏了我们俩
They came and they took us both.

102
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,910
我逃了出来  我让你母亲失望了
I managed to escape. I let your mother down.

103
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,530
不
No.

104
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,830
是我低估了洛特的能力
I misjudged what Lot was capable of.

105
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,360
责任在我
I bear the responsibility.

106
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,160
那你就帮我们吧  帮我们为她的死复仇
Then you help us. Help us avenge her death.

107
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:22,870
我们不能以死相争  而要以智取胜
Now we'll fight... not by blood, by guile.

108
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,660
听我的指挥  她不会白白牺牲的
Follow me and she won't have died in vain.

109
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
你在哪
Where are you?

110
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,880
尤瑟已死  但是又冒出来一个
Uther is dead. But there's another.

111
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,920
尤瑟的儿子
Uther's boy.

112
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,570
这不会改变什么
It makes no difference.

113
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,080
他现在一无所有  他母亲也被杀了
He has nothing now. His mother was killed.

114
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,940
他的锐气已挫
His spirit is broken.

115
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,380
时机就要到了
It's nearly the time.

116
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,370
我发誓
I swear.

117
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,450
你今天有个重要的任务
You've a big task today.

118
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,630
你每天都这么说
You say that every day.

119
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,720
今天这个是最重要的
This is your biggest.

120
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,000
你知道他在说什么吗
D'you know what he's talking about?

121
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,680
不知道  但他说你需要我
Nope. He said you'd need me.

122
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,130
不过话说回来  你一直都是需要我的
But then, you always need me!

123
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,240
才没有呢
I don't think so.

124
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,720
国王的存在主要是一个概念
A king exists primarily as an idea.

125
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,890
我们要说服人们去相信你做为国王的概念
We persuade the people to believe in the idea of you,

126
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,930
然后再把它变成现实
then we can make it a reality.

127
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,040
里昂提斯也会一起来
Leontes will join us.

128
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,210
他有你用得到的装备
He has the equipment you'll need.

129
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,790
什么装备  你在说什么啊
What equipment? What're you talking about?

130
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,030
是啊  我要怎么成为一个新的概念呢
Yeah, how do I become a new idea?

131
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,260
你要做到不可能的事
By doing the impossible.

132
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,510
罗马人认为那剑
The Romans believed that sword

133
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,490
属于马尔斯  他们的战神
belonged to Mars, their God of War.

134
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,200
我们知道这个传说  谢谢
We all know the legend, thank you.

135
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,830
小时候就听说过了
We were told it as children.

136
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,080
现在不信  以前也没信过
I didn't believe it then, either.

137
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,500
它到底在那上面多久了
How long has it really been there?

138
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,350
没人知道到底多久了
Nobody knows exactly how long.

139
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,410
今天  你要把它拿回来
Today, you'll retrieve it.

140
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,530
祝你好运了  老弟
Good luck with that, Brother.

141
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,900
不可能
No way.

142
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,950
每一个尝试的人都死了
Anyone who's tried it has died.

143
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,570
传说说的很明白  能把剑从石头里
The legend's clear: whoever pulls the sword

144
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,560
拔出来的人  将统一不列颠  登基为王
from that rock shall be the King to unite all of Briton.

145
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,320
那剑插在上面几个世纪了
It's been there for centuries.

146
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,940
从未有人做到过
No one's ever done it before;

147
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,950
你为什么觉得我能做到呢
why you think I can do it?

148
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,680
因为没有人比你更迫切地
Because no one's ever needed to do it,

149
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,730
需要做到
as much as you do.

150
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,600
你的时机到了  相信你自己
This is your moment. Believe in yourself.

151
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,280
也许先训练训练...
Maybe with some training...

152
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,690
不行  必须是现在
No! It has to be now.

153
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,290
要是这么重要  你怎么不去做
If it's so important, why don't you do it?

154
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,410
别总依赖我  要学会靠自己的努力去争取
Stop pulling at me and start pushing yourself!

155
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,160
你有力量和智慧
You've strength and intelligence.

156
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,630
但如果不尽力  你就不会成为国王
But if you won't try, you're not my king.

157
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,430
那一切就都白费了
And everything will have been for nothing.

158
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,010
我有个主意
I have an idea.

159
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,510
你去哪了
Where were you?

160
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,490
我醒来的时候你不在我身边
I woke and you weren't beside me.

161
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,390
我早上喜欢出去散步
I like to walk in the mornings.

162
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,420
滚开吧  小淫妇
Move your arse, ya trout.

163
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,180
去哪散步了
Walk where?

164
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,600
林子里
The woods.

165
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,760
消息都传出去了
The word has spread.

166
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,350
我们已扬名在外  他们都开始送礼了
We've made our mark. They're sending gifts.

167
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,440
送回去
Send them back.

168
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,860
现在收礼有点早了  我们还没赢得地位
It's too early for gifts. Nothing's been won.

169
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,600
少来了  收礼哪有嫌早的
Ah come, come, it's never too early for gifts.

170
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,130
他们知道我们就要接手这片领土了
They understand who'll be in charge of the realm.

171
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,770
想表示对我们的敬意
They want to show respect.

172
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,760
等那男孩走了我们才配收这些礼
We'll deserve it when the boy is gone.

173
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,260
有人看见那男孩今早骑马离开卡米洛特
The boy was seen riding out of camelot this morning.

174
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,020
他们夹着尾巴跑呢
They're scurrying away.

175
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,410
你确定吗
And you know that for sure?

176
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,120
我知道恐惧能如何作用于人
I know what fear does to people.

177
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,590
我们将把卡米洛特废墟里剩下的人都赶走
We will drive all those that remain from the ruins of Camelot.

178
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,530
然后庆祝我们的新婚
Then we will celebrate our wedding

179
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,050
并为加冕礼做准备
and make preparations for our coronation.

180
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,750
拜托  承认吧  这多让人激动啊
Oh, come on, you've got to admit, it's exciting.

181
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,850
要是你在筹划打仗  而非庆祝
I'd be excited if you were planning battles,

182
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,710
我会更激动的  陛下
instead of ceremonies... My Lord.

183
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,700
我父亲能坐稳王位就是因为他从不自满
My father stayed King because he never became complacent.

184
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,260
希望我无需质疑我们结盟的决定
I hope I won't have cause to doubt our alliance.

185
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,350
准备好了吗
Ready?

186
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,980
兄弟连心  其力断金
Stronger together.

187
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,530
我在找我的儿子们  凯和亚瑟
I'm looking for my sons, Kay and Arthur.

188
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,560
你看到他们了吗
Have you seen them?

189
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,660
您是埃克特
You're Ector?

190
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,530
您是亚瑟的母亲
And you're his mother.

191
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,670
我是他的生母
I gave birth to him.

192
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,440
您妻子才是他母亲
But your wife was more his mother.

193
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,160
我为她的死感到非常遗憾
I'm so sorry for her death.

194
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,740
谢谢
Thank you.

195
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,940
我们总会想象您的容颜
We always wondered what you looked,

196
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,430
想象他会有多像您
how much of you was in him.

197
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,360
我们曾想过如果你来找他
We used to talk about what might happen

198
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,030
我们会怎么样
if you came to claim him.

199
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,030
但你却一直没来
But you never came.

200
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,980
我不能去  他们禁止我去找他
I couldn't. I was forbidden to search for him,

201
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,860
甚至不能说起他
or speak of him.

202
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,350
有人骑马来了
A rider approaches...

203
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,620
是啊
Of course.

204
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,250
打开大门
Open the gates!

205
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,570
出什么事了
What's going on?

206
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,610
有人想要拔出战神之剑
Someone's trying to pull the Sword of Mars.

207
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,630
亚瑟
Arthur.

208
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,370
管用啊  这办法管用
It's working! It's working!

209
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,590
加油  拉啊  凯
Come on, pull, Kay!

210
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,780
那是作弊
That's cheating.

211
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,440
这是创新
It's initiative.

212
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,700
很好  继续
Yes! Come on!

213
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,150
准备烽火
Prepare the beacon.

214
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,130
浪费木材  他得不到那把剑的
Waste of wood. He'll not get that Sword.

215
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,140
走开
Piss off.

216
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,470
用力
Come on!

217
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,310
我们成功了
We did it!

218
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,060
你说过我们的首要任务是保护国王
I thought you said our priority was to protect the King.

219
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,450
我站在这里
I've been on those rocks.

220
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,900
你却让他去冒险
You're sending him to his death.

221
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,630
即便他得到了石中剑  那不可能...
Even if he gets to the Sword, it's impossible...

222
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,610
不可能成功
can't be done.

223
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,210
他能成功
It can.

224
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,470
必须成功
It must.

225
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,640
我们已一无所有
We've nothing.

226
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,530
继续爬
Keep Going!

227
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,400
继续爬  亚瑟
Keep Going, Arthur!

228
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,270
你们在浪费时间  伙计们
You're wasting your time, lads.

229
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,440
他不会成功的
He'll never make it.

230
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,560
他会成功
He'll make it.

231
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,930
他们来观看传奇的诞生了
They've come to watch a legend born.

232
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,380
别停下  亚瑟  别停
Don't stop Arthur! Don't stop!

233
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,580
亚瑟  集中精力
Concentrate, Arthur.

234
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,700
用你的力量和智慧...
Strength and intelligence...

235
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,560
别再依赖于我
Now stop pulling at me

236
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,500
靠自己的努力去争取
and start pushing yourself!

237
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,730
好样的
Yes!

238
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,390
亚瑟
Arthur!

239
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,810
亚瑟
Arthur?

240
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,250
他还有呼吸吗
Is he breathing?

241
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,650
你成功了  我的孩子
You did it, my boy.

242
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,690
他成功了
He did it!

243
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,120
发信号  点亮烽火
Send the signal. Light the beacon.

244
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,840
告诉每一个子民
Tell everyone.

245
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,780
他们的新国王诞生了
The new king has come.

246
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,710
这不可能是真的
It can't be true.

247
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,110
如果他得到了众神之剑
If he has the Sword of the Gods,

248
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,310
人们将会为他而战
people will fight for him.

249
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,540
你以为我不知道吗
You think I don't know that?

250
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,540
那正是他今早出去的原因
That's why he rode out this morning.

251
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,190
你低估了他
You underestimated him,

252
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,420
你这懒鬼
you lazy cunt!

253
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,410
你竟敢那样说我
Don't you talk to me like that!

254
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,190
我们结盟了
We have an alliance

255
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,400
我的盟友不能那样说我
and my allies don't speak to me in that way.

256
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,010
如果你是个男人  我会杀了你
Now, if you were a man, I'd kill you.

257
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,750
现在我要换种方式教训你
I'm just going to teach you a lesson instead.

258
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,820
你是对的
You're right.

259
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,720
让他们看看你怎么掌控我
Show them how you control me.

260
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,670
来啊  你想怎样就怎样
Here, however you want. Do it.

261
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,300
行使你至高无上的权利
Assert your supremacy.

262
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,650
让他们看看你多强壮  干吧
They need to see you're strong. Do it!

263
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,190
来啊  我准备好了  干啊
Come on! I'm ready. Do it!

264
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,050
不  我有更好的主意
No. I've got a better idea.

265
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
你们需要休息
You all need to rest.

266
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,470
我们不会离开他
We're not leaving him.

267
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,150
如果你们累垮了对他无益
You're no good to him exhausted.

268
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,420
晚上我们轮流照顾他
We'll take turns to sit with him through the night.

269
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,070
如果他伤势恶化
If he worsens,

270
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,860
当值之人就叫醒其他人
whoever's on duty can wake the others.

271
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,930
做点什么吧
Do something!

272
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,130
你有魔法
You have powers!

273
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,610
治愈他
Fix this!

274
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,340
不行
No.

275
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,260
那你还有何用
Then what use are you?

276
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,360
你是个聪明的婊子
You're a clever bitch.

277
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,610
但你玩不过我  贱人
But you can't play me, woman.

278
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,830
放开我
Release me!

279
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,650
你将我引入你的城堡
You brought me into your castle.

280
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,260
你以为可以控制我
You thought you could control me,

281
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,350
达成你的目的
for your own ends,

282
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,510
但你错了
but you were wrong.

283
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,560
我们应该专注于尤瑟的杂种
We should be focusing on Uther's bastard!

284
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,490
你必须思考一下
You need to think

285
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,100
我们联盟的本质
about the nature of our alliance.

286
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,810
以及真正的力量之源
And where the true power lies.

287
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,020
别这样
Don't do this.

288
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,360
如果你没被狼吃掉的话
I'll talk to you in the morning.

289
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,150
我明早再来和你谈
Unless the wolves get you first.

290
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,270
你刚出生就离开了我
You've had a terrible loss

291
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:56,490
此事已无法...弥补
and nothing can... heal that.

292
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,900
但我可以帮你
And I could be useful.

293
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,220
虽然我们还不亲近
I know that we are strangers,

294
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,250
但我可以帮你
but I could help you.

295
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,340
我懂得运营城堡
I know how a castle is run,

296
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,470
我懂得帝王之道
and I know how a king should live.

297
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,350
我会辅佐你
I can do that for you.

298
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,660
求求你
Please,

299
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,080
求你让我赎罪
please let me atone for my mistakes.

300
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,580
我找过你
I searched for you.

301
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,290
你没来
You didn't come.

302
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,710
他错了
He is wrong.

303
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,640
谁错了
Who is?

304
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,090
他错了
He is wrong.

305
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,210
他错了
He is wrong.

306
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,670
他没恶化  太好了
He's no worse. That's something.

307
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,550
你该去休息
You should rest.

308
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,790
我会看着他直到黎明
I'll watch till dawn.

309
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,360
我不想再有家人死亡  梅林
I won't have any more death in my family, Merlin.

310
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,830
他这样做了
He did this

311
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,730
你妻子的死才有价值
so your wife's death would serve the cause.

312
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,670
我才不在乎你的理想
I don't care about your cause!

313
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,490
我儿子的生命
My son's life

314
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,470
远比你的计划更重要
far outweighs any plan that you might have.

315
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,160
早啊
Hello.

316
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,460
你摔下了悬崖
You had a fall.

317
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,290
我做到了吗
Did I do it?

318
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,920
做到了什么
Do what?

319
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,760
你做到了
You did it!

320
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:25,670
你是无与伦比的
You were extraordinary!

321
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,530
我们达成共识了吗
Do we understand each other now?

322
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,440
是的
Yes.

323
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,930
好女孩
Good girl.

324
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,200
那男孩拥有了众神之剑
The boy has the Sword of the Gods

325
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,460
据说人们都归顺了他
and the word is that people rally to him.

326
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,840
我给了他五天时间
I've given him five dawns.

327
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,090
他以为可以智取我
He thought he could outwit me.

328
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,140
我的耐心到此为止
My patience is done.

329
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,030
我...不  是我们...
I... no, we...

330
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,250
我们今天就进攻
we attack today.

331
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,370
来吧
Come on.

332
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,020
运气好的话  我就让你骑我的马
If you're lucky, I'll let you ride on the back of my horse.

333
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,580
当心
Careful.

334
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,310
我知道
I know.

335
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,650
大家都没做到  我怎么就做到了
How did I do it, when so many others had failed?

336
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,350
你就是为此而生的
This is what you were born for.

337
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,610
尤瑟的高贵血统  埃克特的良好教育
Uther's bloodline, Ector's education.

338
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,760
你还能够学以致用
You used your knowledge.

339
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,560
这些都是你独有的
Only you have that.

340
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,100
你说得没错
You're right.

341
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,180
我做到了  是我
I did it. Me.

342
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,190
全靠自己
On my own.

343
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,180
也不全是
Nearly on my own.

344
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,340
你说过的一些话
Something you said.

345
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,720
要靠自己  不能依赖你
About pushing, not pulling.

346
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:34,840
可你怎么知道
But how could you know...

347
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,680
除非
unless...

348
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,880
剑是你插的
you put the Sword there.

349
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,730
那个传说是你编的  你知道
You created a legend knowing that, one day,

350
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,210
有一天会有人去征服圣剑
someone would conquer it.

351
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,930
向前看
Eyes round.

352
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,730
那把剑已经插在那里几百年了
That Sword's been there hundreds of years.

353
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,150
谁都不知道到底插了多久
Nobody knows exactly how long.

354
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,170
但你知道
Except you.

355
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,140
你头上有个包
You've had a bump on the head.

356
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,240
噢  感谢上苍
Oh, thank god.

357
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,910
不多说了
Oh, shut up.

358
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:05,810
要成为一国之王
If you want to be a king,

359
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,200
就得受一些磨难
you've gotta learn to take a few knocks.

360
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,120
虽然言不由衷  但总算有一次
Hate to say it, but you didn't need me.

361
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,520
你没需要我了
For once.

362
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,950
多谢
Thank you.

363
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,010
随时为您效劳  陛下
Your servant, My Lord.

364
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,960
好了  他们都在等你
Now. They're waiting.

365
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,880
谁
Who are?

366
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,330
他们都从远处看到你拔出了圣剑
They saw what you did, from afar.

367
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,940
刚开始只是有传言
In the beginning was the word.

368
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,850
后来一传十十传百  人们便都来了
And the word spread. And the people came.

369
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,500
现在我们要当着他们的面为你加冕
Now we'll crown you, in front of them.

370
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,650
现在加冕
You want to crown me now?

371
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,380
他们将成为你的军队
They'll be your forces.

372
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,400
把你奉为国王
Take your place as King.

373
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,750
她来干什么
What does she want?

374
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,520
我去对付她
I'll take care of her.

375
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,190
又来耍什么花招
What're you, the decoy?

376
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,600
我是来警告你们的
I came to warn you.

377
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,110
洛特知道了圣剑的事
Lot knows about the Sword.

378
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,920
你们活不到明天了
You don't have another dawn.

379
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,460
他就要进攻了
He's coming.

380
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,600
为什么要告诉我
Why tell me this?

381
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,150
摩根
Morgan!

382
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,990
好运
Good luck.

383
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,580
传下话去
Pass the word around.

384
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,750
洛特大军快来了  安排好一切备战事宜
King Lot is on his way. Everything must be prepared.

385
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,080
现在我们知道了时间  但不知他会怎么打
Now we know when; we just don't know how.

386
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,810
加冕礼绝不能有任何差池
Nothing must stop this coronation.

387
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,720
亚瑟  任命我为国王护卫
Arthur, make me your Champion.

388
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,340
命我为护卫  我会找到洛特
Make me your Champion, and I will find Lot

389
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,590
为你母亲报仇
and avenge the death of your mother.

390
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,980
国仇家恨一起报
For our family and country.

391
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,130
在下梅林  圣剑在此
It's Merlin! With the Sword!

392
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,410
今日  我等要向
Today, we pledge our allegiance

393
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,160
大不列颠之王宣誓效忠
to the King of all Britons;

394
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,130
正是他拔出了众神之剑
the one who removed the Sword of the Gods.

395
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,920
现在有请
I present to you,

396
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,630
你们当之无愧的国王
your undoubted King.

397
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,090
你是否愿意庄严起誓
Will you solemnly swear to rule the

398
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,400
将要秉承民众之
peoples of this realm according to their laws

399
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,670
律法  风俗 和正义
and customs and cause law and justice, in mercy,

400
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,000
慈悲地统治你的子民
to be executed in all your judgments?

401
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,130
我愿意
I will.

402
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,820
你是否愿意秉承天主教条
Will you maintain the laws of God

403
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,850
与马太福音
and the true profession of the Gospel?

404
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,460
我愿意
I will.

405
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,320
以此王冠为鉴  我宣布
With this crown, I anoint you

406
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,070
你为不列颠之王
King of the Britons.

407
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,870
请起  亚瑟王
Arise, King Arthur.

408
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:56,140
一提起列王  我总觉得他们是
When I hear of kings, I think of warriors,

409
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,800
为得到王位不惜大开杀戒的好战之人
coming to the throne through slaughter.

410
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,310
我亚瑟绝不是那种人
I am not that person.

411
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,280
但我深知那些人让人民损失惨重
But I have known loss at the hands of those men.

412
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,870
我不会重蹈覆辙
I'm something new.

413
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,240
今日站在诸位面前  我才明白
Standing here before you, I realize that.

414
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,450
我知道你们对我寄予厚望
I know I carry your hope in me.

415
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,430
而我  将在此地  卡米洛特
And I will establish, here at Camelot,

416
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,910
以一种新的方式统治你们  我的子民
a new way of ruling, for you, the people!

417
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,380
我今日之成就  都归功于我的家人
Everything I am, I owe to my family.

418
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,350
不仅是我的血亲
Not just my bloodline,

419
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,380
还有那些拥护我的人们
but those who raised me.

420
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,470
国不成家  则何以为国家
And a country is nothing if not a family.

421
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,340
因此  我召父亲与兄长前来
So, I call upon my father and my brother

422
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,350
共谋大业
to join me here!

423
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,130
没有兄长的督导
Without my brother's guidance,

424
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,150
我难以成器
I wouldn't be the man I am.

425
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,310
我请他督察整个王国
I demand he apply his stewardship to all the realm.

426
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,410
我任命我的兄长  凯  为英格兰元帅
My brother, Kay... Marshal of England!

427
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,760
每个国王都需要护卫
And every king needs his Champions.

428
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,130
在我的加冕礼上
And on my coronation,

429
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,170
我选择我的父亲埃克特
I choose my father, Ector.

430
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,210
他居功至伟
There is no greater man.

431
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:22,340
还有里昂提斯  他是我的救命恩人
And also Leontes, to whom I owe my life.

432
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,120
这不是我一个人的国家  是我们的国家
This is not my country. It is ours.

433
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,300
我是亚瑟·彭德拉根
I am Arthur Pendragon

434
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,840
能成为诸位的国王  我倍感骄傲
and I am proud to be your King.

435
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,820
你好
Hello.

436
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,320
你好
Hello.

437
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,500
敢问芳名
So, what is your name?

438
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,100
桂妮维尔
It's Guinevere.

439
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,250
我是亚瑟
Arthur.

440
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,370
我知道
Yes. I know.

441
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,740
咱们找个安静的地方说话吧
Let's find a quieter place to talk.

442
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,580
没想到还能再见到你
I didn't think I'd see you again.

443
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,150
据我所知  你能活下来实属运气
From what I hear, you're lucky to be alive.

444
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,010
那实在有点鲁莽
That was pretty reckless...

445
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,900
不过也很勇敢
and very brave.

446
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,420
谢谢
Thank you.

447
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,690
我喜欢你刚才说的那些话
I like what you said.

448
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,830
从没想过一位国王能说出那样的话
I never expected a King to say those things.

449
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,000
这算好事吗
Is that a good thing?

450
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,190
对我来说是的
To me it is.

451
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,190
高高在上的感觉如何
What was it like up there?

452
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,020
君临天下的感觉
All those people?

453
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:00,940
就像是我生命中第二次
Like, for only the second time in my life,

454
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,430
在正确的时间站在了正确的地点
I was standing in the right place at the right time.

455
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,270
那第一次在哪里
When was the first?

456
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,580
在海滩  遇到了初相识的某人
On a beach with someone I'd just met.

457
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,190
在这城墙里也能看到那片海滩
You can see the beach from the ramparts.

458
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,680
来  我带你去
Come on, I'll show you.

459
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,770
二十年前  你从我身边带走了他
You took him from me, 20 years ago.

460
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,120
可你看起来一点都没老
And yet you look no older.

461
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,350
是你的记忆捉弄了你
Your memory is playing tricks.

462
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,880
不  那晚对我来说记忆犹新
No. That night is branded on my soul.

463
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,920
你一点也没老  这怎么可能
You have not aged one day. How is that possible?

464
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,400
是不可能
It's not.

465
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,860
太美了
It is beautiful.

466
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,860
你在想什么
What are you thinking about?

467
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,650
未来
The future.

468
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,320
未来会怎样
What about it?

469
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,280
你就不担心这一切的重责
Don't you worry that all this

470
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,220
会改变你吗
responsibility will change you?

471
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,300
会把你压垮吗
Close you down?

472
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,450
你不说  我还真没担心过
I didn't until you just said it.

473
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,450
你说从这儿跳下去会死吗
Do you think you'd die if you jumped off here?

474
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,770
不会  我就是活生生的例子
No. I'm living proof.

475
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:56,190
这里可高多了  你确定吗
It's a lot higher. Are you sure?

476
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,370
只要避开岩石就行
As long as you avoid those rocks.

477
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,800
还有那些断树桩
And that stump.

478
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,430
当然  你绝不想撞到那些断桩
Of course you wouldn't want to hit that stump.

479
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,670
你觉得海有多深
How deep do you think that sea is down there?

480
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,630
想知道吗
Do you want to find out?

481
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,130
如果你跳  我也跳
If you do, I will.

482
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,070
准备好了吗
Ready?

483
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,680
一
One...

484
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:42,490
二  三
and Two, three.

485
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,190
你没事吧
Are you all right?

486
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,860
我就知道你不会跳
I knew you weren't going to do it.

487
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,110
如果你跳了  我肯定跳
I would if you had.

488
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,340
楼下玩得很疯狂
It is madness down there.

489
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,000
楼上也很疯狂
It is madness up here.

490
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,900
里昂提斯  认识桂妮维尔吗
Leontes, have you met Guinevere?

491
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,100
不认识
No.

492
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,170
桂妮维尔  这位是杰出的里昂提斯
Guinevere, this is the amazing Leontes.

493
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,000
其实  我们相识很久了
Actually, we've known each other a very long time.

494
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,020
孩提时  我们就是朋友
We've been friends since childhood.

495
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:10,020
她是我的未婚妻
This is my betrothed.

496
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,030
没错
I am.

497
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,030
太好了  恭喜
That's wonderful. Congratulations!

498
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,030
谢谢
Thank you.

499
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:25,130
她就是我找寻一生的唯一
I was just looking for her.

500
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:32,110
你们很幸运  幸运的一对
You're very lucky. A lucky couple.

501
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,740
这位勇士救了我的命
This man saved my life.

502
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,610
当然  他就是这种人
Yes, he does that.

503
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,050
那好吧  我该下去继续狂欢了
Well then. I should get back to the madness.

504
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,870
尽情享受吧
Enjoy.

505
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,510
敌军已经混进来了
They're already here!

506
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,900
凯  护驾
Kay! Protect the King!

507
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,310
快  这边走  快走
Leave! This way! Go, go, go!

508
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,230
站稳了  伙计
Stand strong men!

509
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,600
快把他带走
Get him out of here!

510
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,920
马上走
Out of here, now!

511
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,420
要想活命就给我让开
Out of my way and you live.

512
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,480
你不知道我是谁吧
You don't know who I am, do you?

513
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,630
我可不在乎你是谁
I don't care who you are.

514
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:56,870
你杀了我的妻子
I'm the man whose wife you killed.

515
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,200
那又怎样
And?

516
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,810
告诉我她的名字
Tell me her name.

517
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,050
什么
What?

518
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,040
那个被你杀害的女人的名字
The name of the woman you slaughtered.

519
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,270
最关键的是她已经死了
The only thing matters is she died.

520
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,880
她跪着过完了人生的最后时刻
She spent her last hours on her knees.

521
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,670
够了
Enough!

522
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,150
现在  去跟她作伴吧
And now you're going to join her.

523
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,990
父亲
Father!

524
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,570
父亲
Father!

525
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:55,480
不  不  不  不  父亲
Oh no, no, no no...no... Father...

526
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,910
把尸体拖到广场上去
Drag his body into the courtyard.

527
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,910
确保所有人都知道洛特王已经被打败了
Make sure everyone knows King Lot has been vanquished.

528
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,810
儿子们  我爱你们
My sons. I love you.

529
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,180
不  别死
No, please!

530
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,280
父亲
Father!

531
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,820
我试图与人结为联盟
I tried an alliance with a man.

532
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,730
但他失败了
But he was wrong.

533
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:25,300
人类不能助我夺得王位
Men are not my way to this.

534
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,320
我会另想办法的
I'll find another way to take it.

535
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,260
为什么你要夺走一切
Why do you need to take it at all?

536
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,910
从现在起  你的城堡将由我来保护
I'm placing your castle under my protection from now on.

537
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,910
以感谢你的警告
In gratitude for your warning.

538
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,010
我们不必反目成仇
We don't need to be opposed.

539
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,400
我们可以共谱大业
We can work together.

540
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,200
王位非你即我  不可能属于两人
It's either you or me. It can't be both.

541
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,500
为什么
Why not?

542
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,690
对你而言  这没什么
For you, this is nothing.

543
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,750
对我来说  这就是一切
For me, everything.

544
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,790
那晚  你看到了什么
What did you see in the night?

545
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,730
我知道那是什么  你呢
I know what it is. Do you?

546
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,330
别靠近它
Don't go near it.

547
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,790
千万别跟它有任何瓜葛
Don't have anything to do with it!

548
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,100
你在哪里
Where are you?

549
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,690
我所求更多
I need more.

550
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,390
告诉我  我该怎么做
Tell me what I have to do.
