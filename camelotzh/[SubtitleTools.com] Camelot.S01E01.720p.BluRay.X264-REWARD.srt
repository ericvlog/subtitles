尤瑟陛下  有访客
King Uther, there is a visitor.

4
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,010
她不肯透露姓名
She won't give her name.

5
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,670
你是何人
Who are you?

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,370
摩根
Morgan.

7
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,780
父王
Father.

8
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,910
你那贱人还活着
Your whore still lives.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,250
要尊重你的母后
You'll respect your mother.

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,620
是继母
Stepmother.

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,080
你为何来此
Why are you here?

12
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,710
我回来是想告诉你  我原谅了你
I've come home and I want to offer you forgiveness.

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,740
原谅我什么
For what?

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,230
原谅你害死我的母亲
For the death of my mother,

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,950
只为立这贱人为后
so you could install this whore.

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,490
原谅你流放了我  以便堵住我的嘴
And for banishing me so I'd be silenced.

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,020
我送走你  是为了让你得到教育
I sent you away for an education.

18
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,010
在修道院待了十五年  我学到的
Fifteen years in a nunnery, I learned more

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,430
远超乎你的想象
than you can imagine.

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,390
父王  我是你唯一的孩子
Father, I'm your only child.

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,110
你为何不肯欢迎我回家呢
Why wouldn't you welcome me home?

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
你脱离我的指引太久了
You've lived too long without my guidance.

23
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,420
这里已经不是你的家了
This isn't your home now.

24
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,940
我也不再有你这个女儿了
And I no longer have a daughter.

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,240
别抛弃我  父王
Don't turn your back on me, Father!

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,590
这里不欢迎你  摩根
You're not welcome Morgan.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
后会无期
Goodbye.

28
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,350
伊格兰  别理会她
Igraine, leave her.

29
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,940
尤瑟  尤瑟
Uther! Uther!

30
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
尤瑟
Uther?

31
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,830
尤瑟  你怎么了
Uther! What's wrong?

32
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,510
救命  快来人救救他  尤瑟
Help! Somebody help him! Uther!

33
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,180
帮帮我们
Help us!

34
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,190
闪开
Out of my way!

35
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,070
打开大门
Open the gates!

36
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,390
救他  救他
Help him! Help him!

37
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,350
快送陛下回寝宫  快
Take the King to his chambers! Now!

38
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,680
哈利路亚  曾当以色列出离埃及
Alleluia dilexi quoniam exaudiet

39
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,680
出自《圣经·旧约》《圣咏集》》

40
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,510
雅各伯家离开蛮夷时
dominus vocem orationis meae.

41
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,490
犹大成了上主的圣所...
Quia inclinavit aurem...

42
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,290
不管你有什么魔法  快用出来吧
Whatever powers you have, use them now!

43
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,220
尤瑟  你大限将至
Uther, you're going to die.

44
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,580
这药毒性太强
The poison was too strong.

45
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,420
签个名
Put your hand to this.

46
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,680
为了大不列颠和那个男孩
For Briton and the boy.

47
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,470
他的时代结束了
His time is done.

太初有道[拉丁语]
In principio-erat-verbum.

63
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,410
太初有道
In the beginning was the Word.

64
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,340
道就是
And the Word was--

65
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,910
真美啊
God, yes.

66
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,840
这可不是拉丁语课
This isn't Latin study.

67
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,720
对  但这绝对是种崇拜
No, but it is definitely worship.

68
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,120
亚瑟
Arthur!

69
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,390
不会吧
It can't be!

70
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,890
你这混蛋
You bastard!

71
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,960
凯  听着  她说你们两个结束了
Kay, listen-she said you two were over!

72
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,510
亚瑟  我可没那么说
Arthur! No, I did not.

73
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,810
多谢帮忙
Thanks a lot.

74
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,590
住手  你们两个都住手
Stop! Stop it! Both of you!

75
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,640
我真该杀了你
I should kill you.

76
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,190
你怎么找到我们的
How did you even find us?

77
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,190
我知道你会把姑娘们带到什么地方
I know where you bring your girls.

78
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,370
现在连我的姑娘也被你带来了
And now mine, too.

79
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,240
穿上衣服  有人让我来找你  有访客
Get dressed. I was sent to find you. There's a visitor.

80
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,610
跟我有啥关系
What's that got to do with me?

81
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,170
这样很不好  我知道
It's bad. I know.

82
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,740
我不该那么做  我没好好考虑
I shouldn't have done it. I wasn't thinking.

83
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,740
不  你考虑了
No, you were thinking.

84
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,870
你在考虑  "如果被抓到"
You were thinking, if I get caught,

85
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,840
"我可以靠这张嘴来摆脱困境"
I can talk my way out of this.

86
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,990
那是个错误  我们有些忘乎所以
It was a mistake. We got carried away-

87
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,570
两次
twice.

88
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,410
闭嘴  拜托  闭嘴
Shut up. Please, just shut up.

89
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,260
有时候事情自然而然就发生了
Sometimes these things happen.

90
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,170
就好像她是克利欧佩特拉  你是凯撒
It's like she's Cleopatra, you're Caesar,

91
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,190
克利欧佩特拉: 即埃及艳后
她与凯撒及安东尼间的多角恋情请自行搜索

92
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,190
而我是马克·安东尼
and I'm Mark Antony.

93
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,240
不  你真不是
No. You're really not-at all.

94
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,740
不能让一个女人阻碍了我们的关系
We can't let a woman come between us.

95
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,600
是不是  兄弟
Can we, brother?

96
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,140
对你来说  一切都唾手可得
Everything comes easy for you.

97
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,860
你难道不心存感恩吗
Don't you appreciate it.

98
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,800
怎么了
What's going on?

99
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,950
母亲
Mother?

100
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,880
父亲
Father?

101
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,420
他来了
He's here.

102
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,200
你就是那个男孩
So you're the boy.

103
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,190
我是亚瑟  你是谁
I'm Arthur. Who are you?

104
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,150
他叫梅林
His name is Merlin-

105
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,630
这里不欢迎他
and he's not welcome here!

106
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,060
那就让他打道回府
Then he'll be on his way!

107
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,960
-把剑放下  凯  -不
- Put down your sword, Kay. - No!

108
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,990
照我说的做  孩子
Do as you're told, boy!

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,980
谁能跟我解释一下  这是怎么回事
Will someone explain what is happening here?

110
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,920
国王死了  被谋杀的
The King is dead. Murdered.

111
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,160
那又如何
So?

112
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,990
尤瑟在没有正统子嗣的情况下死了
Uther died with no legitimate son.

113
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,940
这跟我们有什么关系
What's that got to do with us?

114
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:46,060
和他们无关  你是尤瑟的儿子
Not them. You-are Uther's son.

115
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,040
不
No.

116
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,550
我的父母就站在这里
My parents are standing here.

117
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,110
告诉他  告诉他啊
Tell him. Tell him.

118
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,540
他说的是事实  亚瑟
He's telling the truth, Arthur.

119
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,820
不可能  这怎么可能
He can't be. How can he be?

120
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,720
你不到一周大的时候  梅林把你送来这里
Merlin brought you to us when you were less than a week old.

121
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,960
我们发誓会照顾你
We swore to look after you.

122
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,230
什么
What?

123
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,290
国王已死
The King is dead.

124
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,390
国王万岁
Long live the King.

125
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,100
收回你的谎话  离开这里
Take your lies and get out!

126
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,570
亚瑟  亚瑟  把剑给我
Arthur, Arthur, give me the blade.

127
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,640
把剑给我
Give me the blade.

128
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,740
你告诉他这是怎么回事
You tell him how this happened.

129
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,030
给他讲他的身世
You tell him the story of his birth.

130
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,260
细节不重要
The details aren't important.

131
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,620
对他来说很重要
They are to him!

132
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,940
亚瑟  我早该告诉你的
Arthur, I should've told you before.

133
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,880
我很抱歉  儿子
I'm-I'm so sorry, son.

134
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,800
今晚好好休息
Rest tonight.

135
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,550
明天  我们出发
Tomorrow, we leave.

136
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,770
她在哪
Where is she?

137
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,520
伊格兰夫人一直在她的寝宫服丧
Lady Igraine remains in mourning in her chamber.

138
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
其他人呢
And the men?

139
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,470
大多数都走了
Most are gone.

140
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,170
谁下的命令
On whose authority?

141
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,300
梅林
Merlin's.

142
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,360
就在你父王去世的当晚
The night after your father's death

143
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,700
他的战士们收拾行装  离开了这里
his warriors packed up their belongings and left.

144
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,720
我们会找到自己的战士
Then we'll move on our own.

145
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,090
更勇猛  更强大
Better and stronger.

146
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,700
我们
We?

147
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,960
你现在听命于我
You answer to me now.

148
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,500
谢谢
Thank you.

149
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,960
把那些旗帜扯下来
Pull down those banners!

150
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,080
没收所有的武器  叫厨房的人动起来
Confiscate all the weapons and someone find the kitchens!

151
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,520
我饿死了
I'm bloody starving.

152
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,940
大门为你敞开  大人
The doors are open to you, my Lord.

153
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,930
不必动用武力
There's no need for force.

154
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,970
召唤我的人就是你吗
Are you the one who summoned me?

155
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,350
我是尤瑟的女儿  唯一的继承人
I'm Uther's daughter and sole heir:

156
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,870
摩根·彭德拉根
Morgan Pendragon.

157
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,310
就在我们对话的同时
Even as we speak,

158
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,840
我的人正在屠杀那些仍忠于尤瑟的人
my men are slaughtering all those still loyal to Uther.

159
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,460
你为何把我召集到此
Why would you call me here?

160
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,250
寻求结盟
To offer an alliance.

161
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,990
与谁结盟
Who with?

162
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,930
我
Me.

163
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,150
你
You?

164
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,460
哪有比你更好的人选  洛特国王
Who better than you, King Lot,

165
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,840
我父亲最强大的对手
my father's strongest opponent.

166
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,150
我不吃奉迎这一套
I am immune to flattery.

167
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,980
但收到邀请  你还是来了
And yet you came when asked.

168
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,610
你没什么能作为筹码
You've nothing to offer me.

169
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,230
我拥有这城堡
I hold this castle.

170
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,840
我可以把你从上到下一刀劈开
I could split you from your gut to your throat

171
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,510
同样能夺取城堡
and still take it.

172
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,690
你不会那么愚蠢
You're cleverer than that.

173
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,530
是吗
Am I?

174
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,620
杀了我  你不过成为又一个军阀
Kill me and you're just another warlord

175
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,100
又多占有一座城池
taking yet another castle.

176
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,660
但若我们能联手
But if we stand together-

177
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,590
我独来独往
I stand alone.

178
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,540
若我们结盟
If we forge a union,

179
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,870
那我们便能统一整个王国
we'd have the strength to unite the realm.

180
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,510
成为国王与女王
As King and Queen.

181
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,230
这里已经有一位女王了
There is already a Queen within these walls.

182
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,560
我娶了她同样能占有尤瑟的王座
I could take her and still sit on Uther's throne.

183
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,990
她将被驱除出境
She's to be exiled.

184
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,760
她已被驱逐了吗
Oh, is she now?

185
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,020
没错
Yes.

186
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,860
你对你的计划信心十足啊
You're very confident in your plans.

187
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,020
的确
I am.

188
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,620
你为何如此特别
What makes you so special?

189
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,580
你敢靠近  我就杀了你
Come near me, I'll kill you.

190
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,730
没必要如此虚张声势
Don't issue empty threats.

191
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,120
你到底是谁
Who are you?

192
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,730
我熟知尤瑟·彭德拉根
I knew Uther Pendragon.

193
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,640
他临死时  我相伴在侧
I was at his side when he died.

194
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,690
国王亲笔签名  加盖印玺的遗嘱
The King's will, signed by his own hand, bearing his seal,

195
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,940
证明了你的出身
attesting to your birth.

196
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,600
这是你父亲的
This was your father's.

197
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,800
拿着
Take it.

198
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,190
你降生后  我就把你带到了这里
When you were born, I took you and brought you here.

199
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,490
你有着国王的血脉  但尤瑟实乃一介莽夫
You may be of King's blood but Uther was a barbarian.

200
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,970
在这里成长  会使你更为出色
Acing you here made you so much more.

201
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,280
我告诉埃克特该如何抚养你  教育你
I told Ector how to raise and educate you.

202
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,330
他发誓要保护你安全成长
He swore to always keep you safe.

203
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,200
他们把你养育得很好
They raised you well.

204
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,520
或许好过头了
Perhaps too well.

205
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,100
为什么  为什么需要我
Why? Why do you need me?

206
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,820
凡事自有定数
Everything in time.

207
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,170
我有时也好奇他们为什么更偏爱你
I sometimes wondered why they doted more on you.

208
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,780
你总是被保护得很好
You're always got away with so much.

209
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,610
不是这样
It was never like that.

210
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,960
一直是这样
It's always been like that.

211
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,710
只是你从未发觉
You've just never seen it.

212
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,620
你习惯了只要你一微笑
You're used to the world falling at your feet

213
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,170
全世界就都会为你倾倒
the moment you smile.

214
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,990
不过没关系
But it's all right.

215
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,060
这就解释得通了
This makes sense of it.

216
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,880
他们待你如掌上明珠
They treated you like you were special.

217
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,310
因为你的确独一无二
Because you are.

218
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,790
你总算承认了
At last you finally admit it.

219
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,410
听着  一切都不会改变
Hey, this doesn't change anything.

220
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,170
你仍然是我的弟弟
You're still my brother.

221
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,770
仍然是惹人厌的淘气包
And you're still infuriating.

222
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,110
我该怎么办
What do I do?

223
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,930
我不能这样一走了之  这是我的家
I can't just leave! This is my home.

224
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,060
这里是我所熟知的一切
This is what I know. Here.

225
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,130
但是你有着更好的选择
But what you're being offered is better.

226
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,590
冲锋陷阵  统领江山
Going to battle, leading the land.

227
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,820
这是所有男人的梦想
It's what every man dreams of.

228
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,120
不  这只是你的梦想
No, it's what you dream of.

229
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,480
我们其他人只梦想着姑娘们
The rest of us dream about girls.

230
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,690
你以为领袖就不能挑选姑娘了吗
You think a leader won't get his choice of girls?

231
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,650
为何不接受这样的命运呢
Why shouldn't it be your destiny?

232
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,650
换做是我  我会去
If it was me, I'd go-

233
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,710
马上就去
in an instant.

234
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,540
看来  你决定了
So, you're coming.

235
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,600
我没说我相信你
I'm not saying I believe you.

236
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,750
我只想亲眼去看看
It's just I want to see it for myself.

237
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,390
你已经准备好了
You're ready.

238
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,070
为什么以前不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

239
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,200
我怕会失去你
I was afraid of losing you.

240
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,690
因为你是我的儿子
Because you are my son.

241
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,390
你永远都是我的母亲
You'll always be my mother.

242
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,630
我就把他托付给你了
I place him in your care.

243
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,300
你必须保护好他
You keep him safe.

244
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,480
我保证
You have my word.

245
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,560
这是你注定的使命
It's what you were born for.

246
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,710
也是我们培养你的目的
It's what we've guided you for.

247
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,950
记住我教你的一切
You remember what I taught you.

248
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,940
做决定时  要开动脑筋
When you make decisions, you use this

249
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,180
结合内心的想法
in conjunction with this.

250
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,770
决不能用下半身思考
And you never use this!

251
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,140
我会努力记住的
I'll try and remember that.

252
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,270
没有比你更好的父亲了
No son ever had a better father.

253
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,420
我希望你明白
I-I want you to know-

254
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,550
我明白  我明白
I know, I know, I know.

255
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,500
我爱你
I love you.

256
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,640
你们已为我付出了所有
You've given me everything my entire life

257
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,700
我无颜再要求更多
and I feel guilty asking for anything more.

258
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,750
但我需要凯
But-I need Kay.

259
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,810
我想要他跟我一起走
I want him with me.

260
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,590
当然  当然
Yes, yes!

261
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,470
无论怎样  我都无法独自面对
Whatever this is, I can't do it without you.

262
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,380
我们还以为你不会要求呢
We were thought you'd never ask.

263
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,920
兄弟同心  其利断金
Together, you're stronger.

264
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,400
是时候了
It's time.

265
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
叫我的名字
Say my name!

266
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,410
摩根
Morgan!

267
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,460
我将是何人
Who will I be?

268
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,910
人民的女王
Queen of the realm!

269
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,530
你能否成为我称职的国王
Are you fit to be my King?

270
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,680
你知道我行
You know I am!

271
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,310
你能给予我什么
What will you give me?

272
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,920
至死不渝的忠诚
Undying loyalty!

273
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,370
发誓忠诚
Swear your fealty!

274
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,990
你先发誓
Swear yours to me!

275
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,870
发誓
Swear it!

276
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,820
我发誓
I swear!

277
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,740
以何之名
On what-

278
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,220
-以我的誓言  -没错
- My oath.  - Yes!

279
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,530
以我的生命
My life!

280
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,580
很好
Yes!

281
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,400
还有你的鲜血
And your blood!

282
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,970
我的鲜血
My blood!

283
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,230
你都是从哪儿学的
Where did you learn that, huh?

284
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,760
父亲一死
Your father dies,

285
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,930
你就流放自己的母亲
and you banish your own mother from her home.

286
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,630
够冷血
Impressive.

287
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,790
是继母
Stepmother.

288
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,580
我是尤瑟唯一的血脉
I'm the only one of Uther's blood.

289
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,880
他的城堡  他的王国都该是我的
His castle and realm should be mine.

290
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,990
于是你就召唤了我  尤瑟最大的死敌
So you summon me, Uther's worst enemy.

291
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,700
你提出与我结盟  接着又引诱了我
You propose an alliance and then seduce me, even

292
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,720
全然不顾你父亲尸骨尚且未寒
as your father's body cools.

293
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,270
你的勃勃野心没有尽头吗
Is there no end to your ambition?

294
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,740
你这是抱怨吗
Are you complaining?

295
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,780
不
No.

296
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,450
只是好奇
Just curious.

297
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,980
女王总是需要一位国王
A queen still requires a king.

298
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,920
没错
Yes.

299
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,720
我们一起将统领整个王国
Together, we'll unite the realm.

300
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,930
没错
Yes.

301
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,540
我去亲自打发她上路
I'll set her on the way myself.

302
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,810
好
Yes.

303
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,860
这样挺适合你的
It suits you up there.

304
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,330
你要去哪儿
Where will you go?

305
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,430
你父亲的盟友会给予我安身之处
Your father had plenty of allies who'll give me space.

306
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,000
还有何事  还是你只是来幸灾乐祸的
Was there anything else, or did you just come to gloat?

307
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,320
我来感激上苍让你活着离开这里
Just give thanks you're leaving here alive.

308
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,290
我从未伤害过你
I did nothing to harm you.

309
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,340
没错  夫人  你从未做过任何事
Indeed, my Lady, you did nothing.

310
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,270
我母亲被害时  你无动于衷
You did nothing when my mother was murdered,

311
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,960
这样你便能取而代之
so that you could take her place.

312
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,840
父王流放我时  你也毫无作为
And you did nothing when my father banished me.

313
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,330
王后无权干涉国王的决定
No queen questions her king!

314
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,350
我以为之前已对你鄙视至极了  没想到此刻更甚
And I thought my opinion of you couldn't get any lower.

315
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,110
一路平安
Safe travels!

316
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,570
背信弃义的国度
The land is treacherous.

317
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,690
我有梅林的口信
I bring a message from Merlin.

318
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,810
梅林  他想怎样
Merlin? What does he want?

319
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,990
他请您去卡米洛特的古城堡
He asks you attend Uther's son

320
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,780
迎接尤瑟的儿子
at the ancient castle of Camelot.

321
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,500
尤瑟的儿子
Uther's son?

322
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,080
我只是原话转告
That's what I was told to deliver.

323
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,100
他有个儿子
He has a son.

324
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,970
我才是王位真正的继承人
I have the only true claim to the throne.

325
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,400
这是梅林的把戏
This is Merlin's game.

326
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,540
那我们就奉陪到底
So, we'll play with him.

327
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,850
如果你对我的身世负有责任
If you were responsible for my birth,

328
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,940
那我理应更多的了解你的身份
I deserve to know more about who you are.

329
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,610
别再问我是谁  好好想想你的身份
Stop asking about me and think about who you are.

330
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,120
你真是巫师吗
Are you really a sorcerer?

331
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,480
我能做到他人认为不可能的事
I can do things others believe impossible.

332
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,310
这算所谓的巫术吗
Is that sorcery?

333
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,090
那试试啊  证明给我看
Go on then. Show me. Prove it to me.

334
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,790
你带我翻山越岭  却什么都不告诉我
You pull me from one coast to the other and you tell me nothing!

335
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,840
你问我为何需要你
You asked me why I need you.

336
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,880
我曾预见过未来的景象
I had a vision of what was to come.

337
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,220
什么景象
What sort of vision?

338
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,780
人所带来的黑暗
The darkness of man.

339
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,290
我不能让历史重蹈覆辙
I won't let it happen again.

340
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,790
你是说我还没进娘胎  你就预见到这种景象了吗
Are you saying you had this vision before I was conceived?

341
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,370
过去无关紧要
The past doesn't matter.

342
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,570
认清当下使命
Define yourself in the present

343
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,450
方能统治未来
and you might rule in the future.

344
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,230
上帝啊
Dear God.

345
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,180
已经开始了
It's already begun.

346
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,550
什么
What?

347
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,110
王国无主  势必各方混战  争权逐利
With no King in place, there'll be carnage across the land.

348
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,780
你要做什么
What're you doing?

349
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,500
不管他们是谁  都应以基督之礼安葬
Whoever these men are, they deserve a Christian burial.

350
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,520
要拯救他们已经太迟了
They're long past saving.

351
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,280
亚瑟  说两句
Arthur-tell him.

352
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,050
此地不宜久留  否则有性命之虞
We stay here, we're a target for whoever did this.

353
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,140
不要操心死者了  活着的人更需要我们
Stop worrying about the dead-the living need us more!

354
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,050
梅林说的对  我们应该马上离开
Merlin's right. We have to get out of here.

355
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,450
现在帮不了他们
We can't help them now.

356
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,450
我们走
Let's move.

357
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,610
就在这里休息
We rest here.

358
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,650
在村里休息  这是明智之举吗
This village? Is that wise?

359
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,380
看看便知
We'll find out.

360
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,430
恐惧如瘟疫蔓延
Fear spreads like plague.

361
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,020
不要下马  径直骑过去
Stay on your horses and ride on through.

362
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,790
我们打算去海边
We are on our way to the coast.

363
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,590
希望今晚在这里过夜
We were hoping for shelter tonight.

364
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,770
这里不欢迎你们
There's no welcome here.

365
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,430
对老朋友也要这样吗
Not even for an old friend?

366
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,960
梅林  是你吗
Merlin! Is that you?

367
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,160
这才像话
That's more like it.

368
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,210
太久没见了
It's been too long.

369
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,620
如果你不完成使命  这些黎民百姓
It's people like these that will be next to the slaughter

370
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,560
就难逃厄运了
if you don't fulfill your destiny.

371
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,560
如果我不跟你来  你打算怎么做
What would you have done if I hadn't come with you.

372
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,120
有个外乡人预言你是未来的国王
A stranger says you're the future king.

373
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,960
也许过一晚  也许过一年
Maybe it takes a night, maybe it takes a year,

374
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,310
反正你拗不过好奇心  总会来的
but in the end you're too curious not to come.

375
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,700
你以为你有那么了解我
You think you know me that well?

376
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,080
我是看着你长大的
I watched you since you were a child.

377
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,540
讲讲我的出身吧
Tell me about my birth.

378
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:21,530
你父亲尤瑟想要一个名为伊格兰的女人
Your father, Uther, desired a woman named Igraine,

379
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,060
而她属于敌对的康沃尔公爵
who belonged to a rival warlord, the Duke of Cornwall.

380
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,610
由于无法打败对方
Unable to best his forces,

381
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:36,200
尤瑟改变了战略
Uther changed tactics

382
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,310
把我召了去
and summoned me.

383
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,580
召你做什么
To do what?

384
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,370
把他变为康沃尔的容貌
To change Uther to resemble Cornwall

385
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,010
如此便能拥有伊格兰  享一夜之欢
so he could have Igraine for just one night.

386
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,480
你想让我相信我是巫术与奸淫的产物
You want me to believe I'm the product of sorcery and rape?

387
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,270
那晚她就怀上了你
You were conceived that night.

388
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,120
梅林  我要真相
Merlin, I want the truth.

389
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,960
而不是编造出来让我相信巫术的故事
Not some story to make me believe in magic.

390
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,310
你相信与否  我不关心
I don't care what you believe.

391
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,950
很久以前我就已经放弃那些誓约了
But I've sworn off those vows a long time ago.

392
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:11,820
为什么
Why?

393
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,810
-因为代价  -什么代价
- Because they cost.  - Cost how?

394
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,330
你到底要不要我讲完
You want me to finish or not?

395
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,270
所以尤瑟把我给了你
So Uther gave me to you.

396
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,930
你就是我的报酬
You were my payment.

397
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,930
你为何要一个孩子作为报酬
Why would you take a child as payment?

398
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,020
这个国家需要一个前所未有的明君
This realm needs a leader better than any who has come before.

399
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,710
有尤瑟的血统  以及埃克特的教导
With Uther's blood line and Ector's guidance,

400
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,810
此人非你莫属
that can be you.

401
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,130
我知道你有疑问
I know you've got questions,

402
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,440
但我会在你左右  共同寻找答案
but I will be at your side and we will find the answers together.

403
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,900
我们要共建充满希望与荣耀的土地
We are going to build a land full of hope

404
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,940
让恐惧烟消云散
and honor where fear is extinguished,

405
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,810
循着灯塔的指引  人们从四面八方
to which people will flock from far and wide,

406
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,670
慕名而来
seeking out our beacon of light.

407
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,240
明日我们就将抵达古老的权力王座
Tomorrow we ride to an ancient seat of power.

408
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,690
你定能成为伟大的君主
You can be the greatest of men

409
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,990
统领一个伟大的王国
in the greatest of lands.

410
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,070
相信我  亚瑟
Trust me, Arthur.

411
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,070
亚瑟
Arthur!

412
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,330
我来了
I'm coming!

413
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,050
洛特王的侍卫
An outrider for King Lot.

414
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,650
这是洛特军队的颜色
These are Lot's colors.

415
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,800
你还尚未即位  就已引发战火了
You're not even installed and you're starting a war!

416
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,970
上马
Back on the horses!

417
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,310
如果他们发现我们在这儿
If we're here when they find him,

418
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,900
你就活不到即位之时了
you won't live to be King.

419
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,470
卡米洛特
Camelot.

420
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,040
这是个废弃的城堡
It's a ruin.

421
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,340
过去是罗马人建造的
The Romans built it.

422
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,410
而我们将在此创造未来
We'll create the future here.

423
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,700
此地战略位置极好  易守难攻
This has good position, strong fortifications.

424
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,020
无人胆敢觊觎
And no one will expect it.

425
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,030
没想到你是这样打算的
This is not what I thought you meant!

426
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,070
我还以为会有军队  武器和仆从
I thought there'd be armies, and weapons and servants!

427
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,910
还有美女
And girls.

428
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,400
肯定不会就这么寒酸吧
There has to be more than this, right?

429
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,760
我的意思是  至少得有钱吧
I mean, I must have money.

430
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,690
没有
No.

431
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,440
我们走的时候你怎么不说
Why didn't you say that before we left!

432
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:13,960
说了你就不会来了
You wouldn't have come.

433
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,490
你没说会是这种情况
You didn't say it would be like this.

434
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,780
你也没问
You didn't ask.

435
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,440
我们要为活命而战
We're in a fight for our lives,

436
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,520
为王国之魂而战
for the soul of this country.

437
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,130
来吧  大家在等着你呢
Now, there are people waiting.

438
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,670
卡米洛特的大殿
The Great Hall of Camelot.

439
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,470
见见这些已经宣誓效忠于你的人吧
Meet those who have sworn their allegiance to you.

440
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,440
欧菲尔斯  里昂提斯  布拉提斯  派力诺
Ulfius! Leontes! Brastias! Pelinor!

441
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,460
您父亲是位伟大的领袖
Your father was a great leader.

442
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,190
忠于您  即忠于先王
Our loyalty passes to you.

443
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,000
我们任您差遣
We stand at your bidding,

444
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,680
誓死保卫彭德拉根血统
ready to defend the Pendragon line.

445
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,270
我不了解尤瑟
I never knew Uther.

446
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,050
但他既然赢得了诸位的忠心
But if he inspired such loyalty, I am humbled

447
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,610
我也不能愧对于此
to stand before you and

448
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,860
我将尽我所能  不辱诸位的耿耿忠心
I'll do whatever I can to justify your allegiance.

449
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,750
听从您的吩咐
We are your servants.

450
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:46,620
这些都是你的战友
These are your allies.

451
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,750
而敌方人多势众  远胜于我
Your enemies are much greater in number.

452
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,530
这又是你早先没提醒我的事儿
Something else you forgot to mention earlier.

453
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,110
洛锡安及奥克尼地区的洛特王
King Lot of Lothian and Orkney.

454
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,140
康沃尔的新任公爵
The new Duke of Cornwall;

455
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,150
南特斯  苏格兰以及卡拉朵斯诸王
Kings Nentes, Scotland, and Carados.

456
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,450
我已要求他们来这里
I've summoned them here.

457
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,240
什么
You've done what?

458
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,370
好让他们认可
So they all can recognize you

459
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,820
你是尤瑟·彭德拉根的正统继承人
as the true heir of Uther Pendragon.

460
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,570
如果他们不认可呢
What if they don't?

461
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,010
必须认可
They must.

462
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,540
这是你的房间
These are your chambers.

463
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,690
我将你父亲的遗物带过来了
I had your father's effects brought here.

464
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,720
他是怎样的人  我的父亲
What was he like? My father.

465
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,150
不屈不挠
Unyielding.

466
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,080
仅此而已吗
That's it?

467
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,560
一个词就形容了他的一生
The life of a man and you take one word.

468
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
你知道这点就够了
It's all you need to know.

469
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,670
不  不够
No, it's not!

470
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,800
我想知道一切
I want to know everything.

471
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,100
他吃什么喝什么  怎么站怎么坐
What he ate, what he drank, how he stood.

472
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,780
他所爱的人  他痛苦与欢笑的缘由
Who he loved, what made him laugh or weep.

473
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,430
而你用一个词就打发了
And you give me one word.

474
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,440
其他人可以告诉你他的各种脾气性格
Anyone else can tell you his character and contradictions.

475
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,000
而我说的这个词是你最需要的
I gave you the word you most require.

476
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,220
是你必须继承的他的品质
The aspect you must take from him.

477
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,300
不屈不挠的强悍
An unyielding strength.

478
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,510
因为从现在开始  所有人都会挑战你的权威
Because from now on, everyone will challenge you,

479
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,790
方方面面
on everything.

480
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,310
你需要被肯定
You need to be certain.

481
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,040
如果没有呢
What if I'm not?

482
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,610
必须如此
You have to be.

483
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,970
如果我错了呢
What if I'm wrong?

484
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,170
绝不可能
You can't be.

485
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,290
还有一件事
Oh, one more thing.

486
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,930
尤瑟还有一个女儿
Uther also had a daughter.

487
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,870
你同父异母的姐姐
Your half-sister.

488
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,050
他在废墟中扶一个孩子即位
He installs a child in a ruin,

489
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,860
还指望整个王国山呼万岁
and expects the kingdom to kneel?

490
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,380
我认为这巫师的脑子有问题
I think the sorcerer's mind is addled.

491
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,890
不  他非常睿智
No, he's clever.

492
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,020
过去曾有一种力量
This was a power, once.

493
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,980
他坚信能够唤醒它
He believes he can awaken it.

494
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,080
你没事吧
Are you all right?

495
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,720
我厌倦了男人们的游戏
The games of men exhaust me.

496
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,070
我们向来武力说话  胜者为王
We ride in strong.

497
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,770
这冒牌货若敢穿我父亲的长袍
If this pretender wears my father's robes,

498
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,080
我定要剜出他的双目
I shall gouge his eyes.

499
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,410
上
On!

500
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,800
那是你姐姐
That's your sister?

501
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,550
他不是
No.

502
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,840
他的确是尤瑟之子  我有证据
He's Uther's son. I have proof.

503
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,980
我父亲没有正统子嗣
My father had no legitimate son.

504
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:10,970
要是有  我一定会知道
I would have known.

505
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,170
说实话  我跟你一样感到诧异
Honestly, this is as strange to me as it is to you.

506
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,120
但当梅林...
But when Merlin-

507
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,680
这家伙也这么能言善辩
It talks, too.

508
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,770
他长相俊美  巧舌如簧
It's pretty, it talks.

509
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,440
但他并非继承人
But it is not an heir.

510
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,470
我们可以联手治国  以慰父亲在天之灵
We can work together to honor our father-

511
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,600
你根本不认识我父亲
You didn't know my father.

512
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,430
瞧瞧他  假冒得连点说服力都没有
Look at it. Not even a convincing pretender.

513
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,300
你并非帝王之材  只是区区一介草民
You're not made of kings, boy, but of common clay.

514
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,370
那巫师承诺给你多少钱
How much did the sorcerer promise you?

515
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,920
他没承诺我任何事
He didn't promise me anything.

516
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,700
你为何要这样对我
Why are you doing this to me?

517
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,380
此事并非私人恩怨
This isn't personal.

518
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,000
我这么做是为了这国家
This is for the country.

519
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,990
这是我与生俱来的权力
This is my birthright.

520
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,910
是吗
Is it?

521
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,750
不如问问他母亲吧
We should ask his mother,

522
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,120
伊格兰王后
Queen Igraine.

523
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,250
你并无子嗣
You were childless.

524
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,840
我可没这么说过
I never spoke of this.

525
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,220
这是其他男人的野种
This is some other man's bastard.

526
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,940
不是我父亲的  否则我一定会知道
Not my father's. I would have known.

527
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,810
可你的确不知道
And yet you didn't.

528
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,810
这是你生下便被我带走的男孩吗
Is this the boy I took from you when he was born?

529
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,570
是的  我确信无疑
Yes, I believe he is.

530
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,240
这就是尤瑟的儿子
This is Uther's son.

531
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,060
我的儿子
My son.

532
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,460
不是吧  去他妈的
No. Fuck this.

533
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,640
你以为这样就完了吗
You think this is the end of it?

534
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,270
梅林告诉我他把尤瑟变成了你丈夫的模样
Merlin told me he changed Uther's face to resemble your husband,

535
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,350
也就是康沃尔公爵
the Duke of Cornwall.

536
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,590
这不可能
That's not possible.

537
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,300
对  听来确实匪夷所思
No, it's not.

538
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,020
但我相信那的确发生过
But I believe it happened.

539
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,750
有那么一瞬间  我看着他
There was a moment, when I looked at him,

540
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,250
仿佛看到了另一个人
that I saw another.

541
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,850
我仿佛看到了尤瑟
I saw Uther.

542
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,400
我不懂
I don't understand.

543
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,050
你后来怎么会成了尤瑟的妻子
How did you then come to be Uther's wife?

544
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,940
尤瑟跟我在一起的那晚
That night that Uther was with me,

545
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,070
他的军队杀害了公爵
his forces killed the Duke.

546
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,290
获胜的军阀可以占有战败者的妻子
The vanquishing warlord can claim the victim's wife.

547
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,630
我能活下来已是幸事
I was lucky to live.

548
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,860
但你怀了我
But you were pregnant with me.

549
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,830
你放弃了我
You gave me up.

550
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,830
是梅林把你从我怀里抢走的
Merlin tore you from my arms.

551
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,780
你就从没想起过我吗
Didn't you ever think of me?

552
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,000
每天清晨醒来  我首先想到的就是你
You were my first thought each morning.

553
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,030
我观察每个男孩的脸庞  希望有一个是你
I studied every boy's face, hoping for you.

554
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,510
我被禁止去找你
I was forbidden to search for you.

555
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,590
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

556
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,680
亚瑟
Arthur.

557
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,500
你没事吧
You all right?

558
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,790
没事
Yes.

559
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,160
她怎么样  一切还好吗
What was she like? How was it?

560
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,010
还行
Fine.

561
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,210
这就完了
That's it?

562
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,930
走  我们去探索一下
Come on, let's explore.

563
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,640
上去看看  走
Let's look up here. Come on.

564
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,470
看
Here,

565
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,400
瞧瞧这个
look at this.

566
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,120
此堡垒由马格纳斯·昆塔斯
Magnus Quintus

567
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,100
修建于
built this fort

568
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,570
瓦伦蒂诺二世统治第六年
in the sixth year of the reign of the Emperor Valentinio the Second.

569
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,530
他完成了一半工事
He who has begun has the work half done.

570
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,530
如果你看到这里的全貌  就不会这么说了
You wouldn't say that if you saw the state of the place now.

571
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,260
想象一下这里当初的盛况吧
Think of what it must have been like back then.

572
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,170
今后也有可能再现当年的辉煌
Or what it can be again.

573
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,620
你跟踪我们
Have you been following us?

574
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,910
这是梅林的指示
Merlin's instructions.

575
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,070
我得保护你的安全
I'm to keep you safe.

576
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,810
保护我还是确保我不会离开
Keep me safe or make sure I don't leave?

577
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:48,850
两者皆有吧
Bit of both.

578
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,210
要是我逃跑了呢
What if I make a run for it?

579
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,870
为什么要跑  你在这里应有尽有
Why would you? You've got everything here.

580
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,270
这里有如此多的....潜力
There's so much-potential.

581
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,760
你的语气很像梅林
You sound like Merlin.

582
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,820
我相信他所做的一切
I believe in what he's doing.

583
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,300
他带你来这里一定有他的原因
Why he brought you here.

584
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,190
所以你即使没见过我  也肯盲目跟从他
So you followed him blindly even though you hadn't met me.

585
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,240
不  不是盲从
No, not blindly.

586
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,320
我们很多人一直觉得  仅仅是战斗还不够
Some of us have always felt it's not enough just to fight;

587
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,380
大家需要一个为之战斗的理由
there has to be a cause worth fighting for.

588
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,420
梅林告诉我们可以建成何等伟业
Merlin's told us what's possible, what can be built here

589
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,740
只要有你和你的王室血脉
with you and your breed of king.

590
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,590
我怎么可能在一夜之间担起此重任
How do I become that overnight?

591
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,600
相信你的本能
Trust your instincts.

592
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,870
我可没有当国王的本能
My instincts aren't that of a king.

593
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,110
万一你只是尚未发掘呢
What if they are and you just don't know it yet?

594
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,170
她是谁
Who is she?

595
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,140
她是谁
Who is she?

596
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,180
她是谁
Who is she?

597
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,060
你干嘛啊
What're you doing?!

598
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,810
她是谁
Who is she?

599
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,880
我不知道
I don't know!

600
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,660
亚瑟  你最好来看看
Arthur! You'd better see this.

601
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,300
他们都是冲着你来的
This is all for you.

602
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,090
天啊  帮帮我吧
God help me.

603
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,650
现在怎么办
What do we do now?

604
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,780
别怯场
Show no fear.

605
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,680
大胆地说
Speak boldly.

606
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,830
像国王一样回应他们
Answer them as their king.

607
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,050
没什么好担心的  对吧
Nothing to worry about, right?

608
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,570
你预见过未来  我会成为国王
I mean, you've had visions. I'm going to be king.

609
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,100
一切都会好的  这是命定的  是有保证的
Everything's going to be fine. It's fate. It's guaranteed.

610
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,360
-不  -不
- No. - No?

611
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,960
如果你死了  幻象会改变
If you die, the visions will change.

612
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,540
个人宿命可以依靠祈求
Fate can go begging.

613
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,430
天命大势却要自己赢得
Destiny has to be won.

614
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,180
此刻过后  一切都将不同以往了  亚瑟
Nothing can ever be the same after this moment, Arthur.

615
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,030
现在离开  你还能保住小命
Leave now and salvage your life.

616
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,320
执意留下  你将会失去一切
Stay, and you'll lose everything.

617
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:05,950
你寡不敌众
You're outnumbered.

618
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,890
别成为一个巫师的傀儡
Don't be a sorcerer's figurehead.

619
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,050
回家去吧
Go home.

620
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:24,110
说话啊  你个乳臭未干的杂种
Speak, y'beardless bastard!

621
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,330
这里是我的地盘
You stand in my hall

622
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,500
是我的王土  你们给我放尊重点
in my realm and you will show me respect!

623
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:39,370
我是尤瑟先王货真价实的正统子嗣
I am the true and legitimate heir to Uther's throne.

624
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,850
你们得发誓效忠于我
And you will pledge your allegiance to me,

625
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:41,840
否则后果自负
or suffer for it.

626
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,870
懂吗  你个胡子拉碴的白痴
Understand that, y'bearded fool?

627
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:46,850
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

628
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,070
带他进来
Bring him in.

629
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:07,880
这是我儿子  我的长子
That's my son. My eldest son.

630
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,190
你杀了他
And you killed him.

631
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,330
当天树林里有两个侍卫
There were two outriders in the woods that day.

632
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,140
活下来的那个目睹了一切
The other one saw it all.

633
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,810
他袭击了我
He attacked me.

634
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,580
不  你个混蛋
No! You bastard!

635
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,580
这阻止不了任何事
This stops nothing-

636
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,730
我并非禽兽
I'm not a monster.

637
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,310
给你们五天时间
Five dawns I'll give you.

638
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,260
让他哀悼五天  然后离开
Five dawns for him to grieve and then be gone.

639
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:18,850
如果你们不走  会有更多的人牺牲
But if you don't leave, there will be more slaughter.

640
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,700
拦住他
Stop him!

641
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,890
拦住他  拦住他  拦住他...
Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Stop-

642
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,270
对不起  我很遗憾
I'm sorry-I'm sorry-

643
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:37,750
梅林  你对我做了什么  放开我
Merlin, what have you done to me? Get off!

644
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,730
你对我做了什么
What have you done to me?
