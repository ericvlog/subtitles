当宙斯问他女儿阿尔特弥斯
When Zeus asked his daughter, Artemis,

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,290
阿尔特弥斯  希腊神话中的月亮兼狩猎女神

17

想要什么作为三岁生日的礼物时
what she would like for her third birthday,

18
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,290
她向他要了六个愿望
she requested that he grant her 6 wishes.

19
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,490
第一个愿望是
The first wish was

20
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,930
可以过自己想过的生活
that she be allowed to live her life

21
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,650
不用受爱情或婚姻的困扰
without the distraction of love or marriage.

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,500
第二个愿望是成为生命的使者
The second wish was to be the bringer of life...

23
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,800
桂妮维尔  有位信使要见你
Guinevere! There's a messenger here to see you.

24
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,790
他说很紧急
He says it's urgent.

25
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,510
进来吧  布里奇特
Coming, Bridget.

26
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,070
-来吧  -起
- Come on! - Up!

27
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,370
继续
Come again!

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,430
-卡米洛特万岁  -加油  伙计们
- Camelot! - Come on lads,

29
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,930
使出吃奶的劲  这是国王的命令
put your backsides into it, would you! King's orders.

30
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,360
用力推
Push!

31
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,400
妈的  这领土面积还真大
Bloody hell, it's a big territory.

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,810
把它插牢了
Stick it well in, now.

33
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,760
你真觉得这会有意义吗
You really think these will make a difference?

34
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,250
国王认为有意义
The King does.

35
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,420
看着不错  但总有一天
Well, they look good. Until they're pulled

36
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,180
会被人拔掉当作柴火用
out of the ground and used for firewood.

37
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,870
这些旗帜会将我们的信息传得更远
These banners push our message further.

38
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,480
会向人们昭示这是亚瑟王的土地
They tell people they're in King Arthur's land...

39
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,170
是受到保护的
That they're protected.

40
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,970
都上马吧  我们还有活要干
On your horses, all of you. We've work to do.

41
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,920
你说什么呢
What do you mean?

42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,220
我们正在干活啊
We're doing the work.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,720
还有更重要的任务  我们要回你的老家
We've a higher priority. We're going to your old home.

44
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,810
为什么
Why?

45
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,800
为了你父亲多年积攒下的书籍
For the library your father put together.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,360
用不着所有人都去吧  巫师
That doesn't need all of us, Sorcerer.

47
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,220
对于我们来说  书如黄金般珍贵
Books are as valuable to us as gold.

48
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,120
-他明白的  -我们得尽快
- Oh, he knows that. - We should have done this sooner.

49
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,070
我们有了军械库  现在需要一个藏书馆
We have an armoury, we need a library.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,090
所以  走吧
So, let's go.

51
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,640
你没事吧
Are you all right?

52
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,520
没事
Yes.

53
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,310
我只是从未想过还会回去
I just never thought I'd be going back there.

54
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,490
我们进度太慢了
We're moving too slowly.

55
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,260
这些楼层需要修缮确保安全
The floors need to be made safe.

56
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,500
清理出更多可居住的房间
More rooms cleared for living space.

57
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,560
把花花草草还有太茂盛的树木都拔掉
Strip out the plants and overgrowth.

58
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,810
我们需要
Oh, and we'll need, uh,

59
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,400
椽子来修复大厅的屋顶
rafters to repair the roof in the Great Hall.

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
殿下  亚瑟
Your Highness. Arthur.

61
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,330
-什么事 -桂妮维尔走了
- What? - Guinevere's gone!

62
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,440
走了是什么意思
What do you mean gone?

63
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,540
她刚才独自一人骑马出去了
She rode out just now by herself.

64
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,490
抱歉  除了您  我不知道还能找谁了
I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to talk to.

65
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,300
她去哪儿了
Where did she go?

66
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,120
您最好和信使谈谈
You should talk to the messenger.

67
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,490
她父亲格兰斯病重
Her father, Leodegrance, he's sick.

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,700
将不久于人世
He has only a few days to live.

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,590
他派我来召她回去
He sent me from the Fenlands

70
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,000
我是从东边的沼泽地过来的
in the east to summon her.

71
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,690
考虑到路途遥远  他可能已经死了
But with the length of the journey, he may be dead already.

72
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,020
能派些人跟着她吗
Can we send some men out after her?

73
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,660
不行  人基本都被派出去标定国界了
No, most are already out marking the territories.

74
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,770
-她一个人不安全  -我去跟着她
- She's not safe out there on her own! - I'll go.

75
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,490
让开  给国王让路
Make way! Make way for the King!

76
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,430
他们等了多久了
How long have they been waiting?

77
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,450
从日出起他们就陆续而至
They started coming at sunrise.

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,140
他们都为了同样目的而来...
They all want the same thing...

79
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,190
希望国王的姐姐能聆听他们的烦恼
to have the ear of the King's sister.

80
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,060
我早说过他们会来的
I told you they'd come.

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,060
你必须以此来扩大影响力
Your influence can only grow from this.

82
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,670
免礼
Don't kneel.

83
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,250
告诉我  你们为何而来
Tell me why you're here.

84
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,940
是为了我儿子
It's about my boy.

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,300
我和孩子他父亲分开已经七年了
Me and his father, we haven't been together for 7 years...

86
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,790
他和另一个女人跑了
He went off with another woman.

87
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,550
现在他想让我儿子去他农场做苦力
Now he wants the boy to help with the labour on his farm.

88
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,520
但他父亲没有抚养他  是我抚养他的
But his father didn't raise him, I did.

89
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,550
他该和我呆在一起
He should stay with me.

90
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,110
你来找我是希望我帮你解决纠纷吗
And you came to me so I would settle your feud?

91
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,780
我带了份礼物给您  一些我家自产的奶
I bought you a gift,some milk from my herd.

92
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,310
你就是孩子的父亲
You're the father.

93
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,760
你凭什么要这个孩子
Why should you have him?

94
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,910
她一直不让我见他
She's always kept him from me.

95
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,620
我需要人帮我干活
I need help with the work.

96
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,060
找他是理所当然  而且他是我唯一的家人
He's old enough to be called on. And he's the only family I have.

97
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,640
你们是否发誓遵从我的决定
Do you both swear to abide by my decision?

98
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,640
-我发誓  -我遵从
- Yes. - I do.

99
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,490
我想向你们买下这孩子
Then I'll buy the child from you.

100
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,900
什么
What?!

101
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,640
我会出个好价钱的
For a good price.

102
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,760
他可以在这里做仆人
He can live here as a servant.

103
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,440
以五头山羊作为交换
Five goats in exchange for him.

104
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,180
我不是为此而来的
That's not why I came!

105
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,630
五头山羊外加两头绵羊
Five goats and 2 sheep.

106
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,920
不行
No.

107
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,450
十头山羊外加五头绵羊  他还小
Ten goats and 5 sheep. He's young,

108
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,080
但他会长大变强壮  他会好好给你干活的
but he'll grow strong. You'll get good work from him.

109
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,690
七头山羊外加三头绵羊
Seven goats, 3 sheep.

110
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,930
你不能这么做
You can't do this!

111
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,180
-九头山羊...  -八头
- Nine goats... - Eight.

112
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,790
外加三头绵羊  这孩子是你的了
And 3 sheep. The boy's yours for that.

113
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,540
-直接付款  -不行
- Immediate payment. - No!

114
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,430
很好
Good!

115
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,600
这孩子和母亲呆一起
The child stays with his mother!

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,120
什么
What?

117
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,710
我们不是刚达成协议了吗
We just made a deal!

118
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,680
你为了几只羊就肯出卖自己的儿子
You bartered your son for nothing.

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,270
你不配做一名父亲  滚
You're not worthy to be called a father. Get out.

120
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,730
快走  赶紧滚
Go on! Out with you!

121
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,390
谢谢
Thank you.

122
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,210
你有个称职的母亲
You have a good mother.

123
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,640
要好好对她
Treasure her.

124
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,540
下一个
Next!

125
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,620
袭击他们的人有可能还在这里
Whoever attacked them could still be here.

126
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,600
救救我
Help.

127
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,500
没事了
It's all right.

128
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,240
-我的妻子...  -别动
- My wife... - Don't move.

129
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,210
他们杀了她吗
Did they spare her?

130
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,930
不管是什么人  他们已经走了
Whoever they were, they've moved on.

131
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,210
我要死了吗
Am I dying?

132
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,250
是的  不管你的信仰是什么
Yes. Whatever you believe in,

133
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,030
现在都是时候安息了
now's the time to make your peace.

134
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,350
-你就不能救救他吗  -你能吗
- Can't you help him? - Can't you?

135
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,570
你有魔法啊  不是吗
You have powers, don't you?

136
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,980
你到底以为我能做什么啊
What exactly do you think I'm capable of?

137
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,280
这个人需要你的帮助
A man needs your help here.

138
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,270
我们都各有气数
We each have our time.

139
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,560
而他气数已尽
His is done.

140
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,610
你这是什么意思
What are you saying?

141
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,770
救救我
Help me.

142
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,800
-求你  -你受伤太重
- Please. - Your wounds are too great.

143
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,390
我们会为你的灵魂祈祷的
We'll pray for your soul.

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,660
要我帮忙吗
Can I help?

145
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,160
好的
Yes.

146
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,380
放松
Easy.

147
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,940
我去挖坑安葬他
I'll dig a grave.

148
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,410
-桂妮维尔  -你怎么来了
- Guinevere. - What're you doing here?

149
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,090
你自己骑马跑了
You rode off on your own.

150
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,830
我父亲要死了
My father's dying.

151
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,570
我听说了  我很遗憾
I heard. I'm sorry.

152
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,890
停下
Stop.

153
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,090
自我大婚后  他就跟他妹妹住在东边
He's been living with his sister, out east, since the wedding.

154
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,560
这样不安全
It's not safe!

155
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,010
要是换了你会怎么做
What would you do if you were me?

156
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,850
-谢谢  -你往哪去
- Thank you. - Where you heading?

157
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,850
-东边  -别从林子里走
- Out east. - Not through the forest.

158
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,090
昨晚又有一起袭击
There was another attack last night.

159
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,140
你妻子不该去那种地方
That's no place for your wife.

160
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,130
我不是他妻子
I'm not his wife.

161
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,370
我不该多管闲事
None of my business.

162
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,920
-这种情况有多久了  -一直都有
- How long has it been like that? - Oh, since always.

163
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,920
经常有受伤的人从这里经过
We get people through here, they're wounded,

164
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,320
他们非常害怕
and they're scared.

165
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,840
这些人只是想苟且谋生罢了
They're just trying to make a living.

166
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,610
人们都说有了...
People said it would be...

167
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,180
有了新国王一切会有所不同
...it would be different with the new King.

168
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,000
但是没有  他没为我们做什么
But no. He's done nothing for us.

169
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,540
也许他已经尽力了
Maybe he's doing his best.

170
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,440
毕竟任务不轻啊
It's a big task.

171
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,670
但他若有心
But he wanted it.

172
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,000
就该做得更好一些
You'd think he'd be better at it.

173
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,920
-我陪你去  -你这样做比我更危险
- I'll accompany you. - You're in more danger than I am.

174
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,370
国王独自出行
The King travelling alone?

175
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,600
没带旗  没带印  在卡米洛特城外
No banners, no seals. Outside of Camelot,

176
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,320
显然没几个人能认出我来
hardly anyone knows what I look like, apparently.

177
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,720
如果你因为我而受伤了
If you get hurt because of me...

178
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,250
我们走海边
We'll take the coast,

179
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,860
不走林子
not the forest.

180
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,530
里昂提斯救过我的命
Leontes saved my life.

181
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,900
我起码该保护我护卫的妻子
The least I can do is guard my champion's wife.

182
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,430
我会送你去见你父亲
I'll take you to your father.

183
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,640
为了里昂提斯
For Leontes.

184
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,160
-为了你们两个人  -别无他意
- For both of you. - No other reason?

185
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,010
过去的已经过去了
The past is done with.

186
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,990
谢谢
Thank you.

187
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,010
她在休息
She's resting.

188
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,590
-你们去哪儿  -她在哪
- Where are you going? - Where is she?

189
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,740
国王的姐姐  我要马上见到她
The King's sister. I need to see her immediately.

190
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,050
她按顺序接见人  而且她今天见的人
She sees people in order. And she has more than enough

191
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,710
已经够多的了
to see today.

192
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,280
大门明天会再次敞开的
The gates will be open again tomorrow.

193
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,520
不行  她得见我们
No. She needs to see us.

194
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,410
马上
Now.

195
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,020
我们出发以来  你几乎没说过话
You've hardly said anything since we set off.

196
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,890
是因为那个女人说的话吗
Is it what that woman said?

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,350
我该怎么做  我们标记了北边的领地
How do I make it work? We stake our territory to the North,

198
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,340
东边的人民就受扰  我解决了东边峡谷的事端
people to the East are vulnerable. I tackle the valleys

199
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,530
南边又有人入侵
in the East, we face incursion from the South.

200
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,810
每一次我失败  或是有所疏漏
Every time I fail, or make an omission,

201
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,190
或是有所偏颇  我就要为
or prioritize, I'm responsible

202
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,390
另一个地方的死亡负责
for a death somewhere else.

203
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,490
现在人人都指望着我了
Everyone looks to me now.

204
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,950
我看到你怎样处理凯特琳父亲的听证会了
I saw how you handled the hearing with Katelyn's father.

205
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,160
你听他们陈述  然后提出质疑
You listened and you questioned.

206
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,240
即使这听证会本来就是你召开的
Even the fact you convened it in the first place.

207
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,940
你理解人民疾苦  你在乎他们
You understand the people, and you care.

208
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,250
你做得很好
Well done.

209
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,930
家庭纠纷  领土纷争
Family disagreements, territorial wrangling...

210
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,210
你都处理得非常好
You handled them all superbly.

211
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,270
等时候到了
And when the time comes,

212
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,380
他们都会对你忠心不二的
all of them shall owe you loyalty.

213
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,000
但现在你该用用你的新魔法了
But now you must apply yourself to your new powers.

214
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,370
你把这魔法请来的
You asked for them,

215
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,790
为什么却不愿使用呢
and yet you shy away from using them. Why?

216
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,390
你很清楚
You know why.

217
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,120
因为我无法忍受穿着她的皮囊
Because I can't bear to be in her skin.

218
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,760
理由不够好
Not good enough.

219
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,200
这是赐予你的天赋
You've been given a gift.

220
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,010
好好利用
Use it.

221
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,350
抱歉打扰您  有个女人
I'm sorry to disturb you. There's a woman

222
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,990
她在大厅里  坚持要马上见您
in the hall insisting on speaking to you immediately.

223
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,240
让她像其他人一样排队等候
Tell her to wait her turn like everyone else.

224
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,750
我说了  只是
I did. It's just...

225
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,080
她说您身处极度危险之中
...she says you're in terrible danger.

226
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,880
你在想你的父亲吗
Are you thinking about your father?

227
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,270
我昨晚梦到他了  仿佛是他在召唤我
Last night I dreamt of him as if he was calling me.

228
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,360
我以前从没梦到过他
I never dreamt of him before.

229
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,680
我们会赶到的
We'll get to him.

230
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,760
如果你能拥有原来的生活  你会接受吗
If you could have your old life back, would you take it?

231
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,260
如果我说会  那意味着我的父母将还在人世
If I said yes, it would mean my parents would be alive.

232
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,620
我将回到过去  对现在的一切一无所知
But I'd be back there and know none of this,

233
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:33,880
但是
and the thing is,

234
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,530
我爱这种生活
I love it.

235
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,000
你的口气好像是以此为耻似的
You say that like you should be ashamed.

236
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,320
我是刚才才意识到这些的
I didn't realize it until just now.

237
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,280
是谁召唤我来
Who has summoned me?

238
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
我们得单独谈谈
We need to speak alone.

239
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,690
在我的子民面前  我没什么好遮掩的
I have nothing to hide from my people.

240
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,230
你没有
You may not,

241
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,400
但你身边的那个女人有
but the woman at your side does.

242
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,370
你们认识吗
Do you know each other?

243
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,170
我不确定
I can't tell.

244
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,580
-取下你的面纱  -你无权命令我
- Take off your veil. - You don't order me.

245
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,100
你告诉她了吗  她知道吗
Have you told her? Does she know?

246
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,230
我不知道你什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

247
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,510
国王的姐姐在庇护一个恶魔
The King's sister harbours a devil.

248
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,980
什么
What?

249
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,160
为何要遮住你的脸  我能一睹芳容吗
Why do you keep your face covered? May I see?

250
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,570
好吧  也许你看到我就会明白了
Yes. Maybe then you'll understand.

251
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,980
怎么回事
How did it happen?

252
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,140
我的女儿在房子里
My daughter was in the building.

253
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,800
她传了个信叫我过去
She'd sent a message for me to come.

254
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,290
我赶到那里  但为时已晚
I got there too late.

255
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,880
着火的时候我也在里面
I was inside when it started.

256
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,340
火焰犹如魔鬼般迅速蔓延...
The flames spread like the devil himself...

257
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,890
遍及大门  地面
Across the doorways, the floors.

258
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,910
接着我听到了她的惨叫
And then I heard her.

259
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,270
这发生在哪里
Where was this?

260
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,940
海对面的修道院
The nunnery across the sea.

261
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,490
我知道你曾在那里住过
I know you were there once.

262
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,020
所以你才会允许她待这里吗
Is that why you allowed her here?

263
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,720
是我主动来她身边的  她需要我
I came to be at her side. She needed me.

264
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,260
当然了
Of course.

265
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,060
你以为没人找得到你
You thought no one would find you.

266
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,710
但找你是我的使命
But I've made it my mission.

267
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,210
是你纵的火
You lit that fire.

268
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,040
修道院被烧
The nunnery burned

269
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,040
-你便是罪魁祸首  -不
- because of you. - No.

270
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,280
我逃出了火场
I pulled myself out,

271
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,020
看到了你
and I saw you,

272
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,790
你躲那里  而我女儿却在垂死哀嚎
hiding as my daughter died screaming.

273
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,340
这不可能
It can't be!

274
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,410
你想怎么样
What do you want?

275
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,760
惩戒
Retribution.

276
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,940
什么程度的惩戒
To what end?

277
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,010
为了我死去的女儿
For the daughter I lost.

278
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,930
你必须公正地审判
You must sit in judgment on

279
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,000
你一直窝藏的女人
the woman you've been harbouring.

280
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,440
她必须被处决
She must be executed.

281
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,680
游得怎么样
How was your swim?

282
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,260
海水冷吗
Was the water cold?

283
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,900
很冷  但我还是得游
Freezing. But I have to swim.

284
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,120
为什么
Why?

285
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,240
为了忘却自己
To forget myself.

286
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,090
为了有片刻脱离尘世
To lose the world for a moment.

287
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,650
尝尝国王的盛宴
The King's feast.

288
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,130
谢谢
Thank you.

289
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,430
你为什么不救他
Why didn't you save him?

290
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,060
我救不了将死之人
I can't stop people dying

291
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,430
或把他们复活
or bring them back from the dead

292
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,790
就跟你们一样
any more than you can.

293
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,660
那么你不是个巫师
So you're not a sorcerer.

294
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,590
那个词对我来说是种侮辱
The word's an insult.

295
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,370
你的魔法是学来的
Did you study magic,

296
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,570
还是与生俱来的
or were you born with it?

297
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,880
都不是
Neither.

298
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,890
那你是怎么会魔法的
So where does it come from?

299
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,490
思索...就会显现
Thought... made manifest.

300
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,320
那样说不通
That doesn't make any sense.

301
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,180
如果我说是上帝赐予的  你就满意了么
Would you be happier if I said it was a gift from God?

302
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,650
那样说我就明白了
It would be clearer to me.

303
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,410
听着  力量存在于火中
Listen, there are forces in the fire,

304
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,810
风中  水中
wind, water,

305
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,470
土中
the earth.

306
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,040
我能用意念重组这些元素...
I can shape these elements to my will...

307
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,780
在某种...微小的程度上
In some... small degree.

308
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,250
不  那是上帝在帮你
No, that's God working through you.

309
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,850
不可能  上帝并不存在
Unlikely, given there is no God.

310
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,250
梅林  我从尤瑟的临终之床
Merlin, I followed you

311
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,460
跟随你到卡米洛特
from Uther's deathbed to Camelot.

312
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,130
我是国王最忠诚的骑士
I'm the King's most loyal knight.

313
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,500
我对你别无所求  只求你尊重我的信仰
All that I ask is that you respect my faith.

314
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,660
就像你尊重我的信仰一样吗
Like you respect mine?

315
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,270
我不理解你的信仰
I don't understand it,

316
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,640
但我并没不尊重
but I don't disrespect it.

317
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,630
我没因你所做之事  而叫你魔鬼
You don't hear me call you a devil for what you do.

318
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,980
那你叫我什么呢
Then what would you call me? Hmm?

319
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,890
可能是天使吧
An angel perhaps?

320
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,530
我有过很多称呼  但从未被这样叫过
I've been called a lot of things, but never that.

321
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,800
真好
Perfect.

322
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,650
那你能召唤风暴卷走这一切吗
So you could summon a storm to blow all this away?

323
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,040
不  那太庞大了
No. Too big.

324
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,360
那代价会要了我的命
The cost would kill me.

325
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,100
什么样的代价
What sort of cost?

326
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,760
既有身体的  也有心理的
On the body. The soul.

327
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,120
它们缠绕在我周围
And those around me.

328
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,170
我会沉迷其中
It's an addiction.

329
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,660
每次清醒之后  我都会克制自己
One which I deny myself every waking hour.

330
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,460
怎么搞的  现在发生这种事
Not now. Of all the times, not now!

331
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,960
我能帮你什么
Is there anything I can get you?

332
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,120
在那些人面前
And in front of all those people!

333
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,170
想想他们会怎么说
Think of what they'll say.

334
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,210
想像一下这事会传播得多块...
Imagine how fast this is spreading...

335
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,770
摩根审判其他人
That Morgan judges others,

336
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,210
却留了个凶手在身边
but keeps a murderer close!

337
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,620
那里没多少人...
There were only a few people there...

338
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,080
那没什么区别  他们会散播流言
That makes no difference! They'll gossip!

339
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,910
他们就爱散播流言
They love to gossip.

340
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,180
我们所做一切不能付之一炬
What we are doing must not be undermined.

341
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,860
这太重要了
It's too important.

342
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,680
她怎么可以这样对我
How could she do this to me?

343
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,340
她怎么可以瞒着我
How could she not tell me?

344
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,030
你会怎么做
What will you do?

345
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,660
我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

346
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,400
我必须公开审理
I must have a public hearing.

347
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,330
公众必须知晓事实
The facts must be heard.

348
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,720
你觉得这事是真的吗
Do you think it's true?

349
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,330
我不需要你质疑我  薇薇安
I don't need you questioning me too, Vivian.

350
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,240
对不起  我没那意思
I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

351
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,850
为什么是现在
Why now?

352
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,190
就在人们开始信任我之时
When people were starting to believe in me.

353
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,130
西比尔请求见你
Sybil asked if she could see you.

354
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,770
这样她就可以再对我撒谎吗
So she can lie to me?

355
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,530
说服我吗
Talk me round? Ha!

356
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,320
告诉她我身体欠安
Tell her I'm indisposed.

357
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,570
你确定吗
Are you sure?

358
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,420
我能安排得神不知鬼不觉
I can arrange it so no one would know or see.

359
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,910
告诉她  我明天公审前见她
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow at the hearing.

360
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,450
我们将查明真相
And we shall uncover the truth.

361
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,780
如果是真的  你会怎么处理
If it's true, what will you do?

362
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,990
够了  薇薇安
That will be all, Vivian.

363
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,250
救救我  救救我
Help me! Help me!

364
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,970
救命啊  来人哪
Help, somebody!

365
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,050
你认为天上那些是什么
What do you think they are, up there?

366
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,280
可能是众神的眼睛在关注着我们
Maybe the eyes of the gods keeping watch.

367
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,690
或是一个神的很多眼睛
Or the many eyes of a single God.

368
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,420
目光遍及各地
Spread across every land,

369
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,430
关注着一切
seeing everything.

370
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,060
我不知道
I don't know.

371
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,330
我很抱歉发生的那些事
I'm sorry for everything that's happened.

372
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,600
很抱歉发生的一切
I'm sorry for it all.

373
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,340
没什么可道歉的
There's nothing to apologize for.

374
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,290
谢谢
Thank you.

375
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,780
拿那个
Take that.

376
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,130
亚瑟
Arthur,

377
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,350
有人
There's somebody here.

378
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,890
还有一个
And the other one.

379
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,210
过来  你  过来
Come here, you! Come here!

380
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,610
别杀我  求你了
No, please!

381
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,550
把东西放下
Put it down,

382
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,690
不然我把你的脸放火里烤
or I put your face in the fire.

383
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,800
你没事吧
Are you all right?

384
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,040
这里被抢劫过了
It's been plundered.

385
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,530
你真认为他们把书籍留下了
Your really think they left the books?

386
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,250
我希望这帮蛮夷之徒
I'm hoping a barbarian's thugs

387
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,970
不识这里的珍宝
didn't realize the treasures that lay here.

388
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,550
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?

389
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,440
真是恍如隔世
This feels another life away.

390
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,390
我先进去
I'll go in first.

391
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,370
我一直欺骗自己说  他日我走进这房间时
I've been kidding myself I could walk back in

392
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,420
我父母会还在这里
and my parents would still be here.

393
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,970
我明白
I know.

394
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,380
书籍不见了  梅林
The books are gone, Merlin.

395
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,970
不
No...

396
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,100
它们必须在这里
They have to be here!

397
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,050
它们不在
They're not.

398
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,320
这说不通
It doesn't make any sense.

399
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,960
也许被人拿走  或是当柴火烧了
Maybe someone took them, or used them as fuel for their fires.

400
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,280
过来受审
Come and be judged.

401
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,380
你已听到指控
You've heard the accusation.

402
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,950
对此有何回应
What do you say in response?

403
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,470
首先
First of all,

404
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,130
我是来请求原谅的
I come to ask forgiveness.

405
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,340
原谅  你杀了我女儿
Forgiveness? You killed my daughter!

406
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,760
让她说
Let her speak.

407
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,890
是你放火烧了修道院吗
Did you burn the nunnery?

408
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,360
是的
Yes.

409
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,540
告诉我们发生了什么
Tell us what happened.

410
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,870
世上有一些力量
There are forces in this world

411
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,060
若想牵制住它们
which must be satisfied

412
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,500
就必须先满足他们
if they are to be kept at bay.

413
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,670
有一项祭典
There was a ritual.

414
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,560
每年选一名女孩献祭
Every year, one girl was selected.

415
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,830
信奉上帝并不意味着我们要放弃旧方式
Embracing God did not mean we abandoned the old ways.

416
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,220
你对我女儿做了什么
What did you do to my daughter?

417
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,260
什么也没有  我发誓
Nothing. I swear.

418
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,940
-你在修道院向魔鬼献祭女孩  -不
- You offered girls to the devil in a nunnery! - No.

419
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,720
不是向魔鬼
Not the devil.

420
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,970
只有少数人明白祭祀的必要性
Only a few understood the necessity of the ritual.

421
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,700
多数人不理解
Many did not.

422
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,930
那天晚上  牧师们到来
That night, the priests came,

423
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,850
寻找祭祀的证据
looking for evidence of the ceremony.

424
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,730
所以我放了火
So I burned it.

425
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,500
但火势蔓延  我无法阻止
But the fire spread. I couldn't stop it.

426
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,310
我跳窗才逃出生天
I only survived by jumping from a window.

427
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,910
每天晚上
Every night...

428
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,910
我都听到她的尖叫
...I hear her screams.

429
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,410
看见她的脸
And see her face.

430
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,160
犹若恶魔  萦绕于心
It haunts me like a demon.

431
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,770
这就是你想说的一切吗
Is that everything you wish to say?

432
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,720
这改变不了什么
This changes nothing!

433
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,020
处决才是唯一正义的决定
An execution is the only just decision.

434
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,390
这关乎一个女人的生死
A woman's life is at stake.

435
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,820
我需要时间考虑
I shall take time to consider.

436
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,380
当我准备好后  你们会听到我的决定
When I'm ready, you shall hear my decision.

437
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,430
现在都退下吧
Now clear the hall.

438
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,810
那是他的盾牌
That's his shield.

439
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,750
他已经逝去了  是吗
He's already dead, isn't he?

440
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,830
无论如何  你都可以面对
Whatever you find here, you can face it.

441
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,320
你来了
You came!

442
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,060
-他肯定会高兴的  -莎拉姑姑
- He'll be so pleased.  - Aunt Sara.

443
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,520
他说过你会来的
He said you'd come.

444
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,070
-他深信不疑  -他怎样了
- He was so sure.  - How is he doing?

445
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,500
饱受痛楚
In a lot of pain.

446
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,270
他一直坚持着等你回来  快进去吧
He's holding on for you. Go on through.

447
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,160
你来了
You came.

448
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,850
是的
Yes.

449
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,500
我想你  爱丽丝
I missed you, Alice.

450
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,630
不  父亲
No, Father.

451
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,720
是我
It's me.

452
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,660
桂妮维尔
Guinevere.

453
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,210
我们还能为他做点什么吗
Is there anything else we can do for him?

454
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,240
只需陪着他
Just be with him.

455
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,270
当宙斯问他女儿阿耳特弥斯
When Zeus asked his daughter, Artemis,

456
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,560
想要什么作为三岁生日的礼物时
what she wanted for her third birthday,

457
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,820
她向他要了六个愿望
she requested that he grant her 6 wishes.

458
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,210
第一个愿望是
The first wish was that she be allowed

459
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,260
可以过自己想过的生活
to live her life...

460
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,690
不用受爱情或婚姻的困扰
...without the distraction of love and marriage.

461
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,370
我不明白...
Here's what I don't understand...

462
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,750
说来话长
Oh, this could take a while.

463
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,610
有意思
Very funny.

464
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,010
你带亚瑟来到卡米洛特
You bring Arthur to Camelot.

465
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,000
你四处招兵买马
You recruit warriors from throughout the realm.

466
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,670
告诉我们使出看家本领为新王效命
You tell all of us to use our skills to serve the new King.

467
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,800
可你自己却不拿出真本事
And yet you won't use yours for the same end.

468
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,610
这不一样
It's different.

469
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,900
为什么  你比我们优秀吗
Why? You're better than us?

470
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,000
因为我厌恶体内的这股力量
Because I loathe this power inside me.

471
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,850
因为它让我恐惧
Because it terrifies me.

472
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,510
因为你否认它
Because you deny it.

473
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,370
因为这力量控制着你
Because it controls you.

474
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,860
因为它把我推向黑暗
Because it pulls me to the dark.

475
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,750
那就阻止它
Then don't let it.

476
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,310
你觉得这与我们学习格斗
You think this is any different than any of us learning combat,

477
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,820
学习克制愤怒以提高技能有所不同吗
learning to suppress rage for greater skill?

478
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,870
我们都在奋斗抗争  都在学习控制
We all struggle, we all fight, and we all learn to control.

479
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,860
你天赋异禀  梅林
You have a raw power, Merlin.

480
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,850
不要否定  而要学习爱上这力量
But instead of denying it, learn to love it.

481
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,830
想象一下到那时你的能力
Imagine what you could be capable of then.

482
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,180
那时你能为卡米洛特带来的一切
What you could bring to Camelot.

483
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,390
以前为何不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

484
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,960
我羞愧难当
I was ashamed.

485
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,150
你来这是因为觉得自己会很安全
You came here because you thought you'd be safe.

486
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,230
不
No.

487
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,530
我是来帮你的
I came here to help you

488
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,920
治愈你的病痛
through your sickness.

489
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,120
看看现在的你
And look at you now.

490
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,590
离王位只有一步之遥
On the verge of the throne.

491
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,560
看你得到了什么  无比的力量
Look at what you've got. So much strength.

492
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,690
只差咫尺之遥
You're so close.

493
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,910
你不能让这个
You mustn't let this...

494
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,970
这个误会  将我们的心血毁了
...this misunderstanding push us off course.

495
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,710
作为国王的姐姐
As the King's sister,

496
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,360
我不能无视教条
I can't ignore what I've been told.

497
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,250
我明白
I understand.

498
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,040
别抛弃我
Don't abandon me.

499
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,480
摩根  求你了
Morgan, please!

500
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,400
晚安  西比尔
Good night, Sybil.

501
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,460
这是他的斗篷
This was his cloak.

502
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,960
他要我确保它归你所有
He said I was to make sure you had it.

503
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,600
谢谢
Thank you.

504
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,700
说点什么好吗
Would you say something?

505
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,120
谢谢你们赶来
Thank you all for being here.

506
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,960
这对他来说意义深重
I'm sure it meant a lot to him.

507
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,770
我很高兴他来这里跟你们同住
I'm so glad he came to be with you here,

508
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,560
你们陪伴他走到了最后
and that you could be near him at the end.

509
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,430
我们对死亡都有着各自的见解
We all have our own ideas of what death might be.

510
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,770
但我们都知道
For all we know,

511
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,500
死亡也许是最好的解脱
Death could be the greatest good that could happen to us.

512
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,410
西塞罗说过  逝去的生命
Cicero said, "The life of the dead

513
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,270
将在记忆中永垂
is placed in the memories of the living".

514
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,420
我们活着时感受到的爱
The love we feel in life

515
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,230
能让人们超脱肉体  永远活下去
keeps people alive beyond their time.

516
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,670
我的父母就无时不与我同在
There isn't a day my parents aren't with me.

517
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,200
他们活在我的记忆中  我的血肉里
In my memories, and in who I am.

518
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,250
但凡有爱之人
Anyone who has given love will always live on

519
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,050
必将被人所爱  永世铭记
in another's heart.

520
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,800
一切都在改变
All is change.

521
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,580
一切来去匆匆
All yields its place and goes.

522
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,730
坚持不懈  秉持信仰
To persevere, trusting in what hopes he has,

523
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,430
才是男人的勇气所在
is courage in a man.

524
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,700
只有懦夫才会绝望
Only the coward despairs.

525
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:27,670
睡吧  晚安
Come on. Good night.

526
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,570
父亲
Father.

527
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,890
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

528
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,200
你若愿意  我们可以多留几日
We could stay longer, if you want.

529
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,840
不
No.

530
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,690
我们回去吧
Let's go home.

531
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,860
这么多书
So many books.

532
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,120
而且种类繁多  包罗万象
And they're all different.

533
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,020
这是人类经验的结晶
All human experience is here.

534
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,560
为什么要藏起来
Why did he hide them?

535
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,450
因为他知道它们的价值
Because he knew their value.

536
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,510
因为他知道我们有朝一日会来取走它们
Because he thought we'd come back for them.

537
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,880
你怎么找到那里的
How did you know where to look?

538
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,420
我们的目的达到了
Well, we got what we came for.

539
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,790
-可以走了吗  -是的
- Shall we go?  - Yes.

540
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,330
我们回去吧
Let's go home.

541
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,070
你没事吧
Are you all right?

542
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,060
今晚很冷
It's colder tonight.

543
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,930
我现在是孤儿了
I'm an orphan now.

544
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,650
能抱抱我吗
Will you hold me?

545
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,100
没别的意思
Nothing else.

546
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,340
只是不想感到孤单
I just don't want to feel alone.

547
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,000
那些不是众神的眼睛
They're not the eyes of the gods;

548
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,340
是逝者的双眸
they're the eyes of those who've passed...

549
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,060
在监护着我们
...watching over us.

550
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,750
我喜欢这说法
I like that.

551
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,030
里昂提斯  跑那么快干嘛
Leontes! What's the hurry?

552
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,690
-怎么了  -一头鹿从我的马前跑了过去
- What happened? - A deer ran in front of my horse.

553
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,070
马儿受惊了  把我扔了下来
It frightened the life out of it... it threw me.

554
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,640
国王的护卫  被一头鹿所伤
The King's champion, wounded by a deer.

555
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,240
你肩膀脱臼了
Your shoulder's come out of the socket.

556
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,550
-我来  -我没事  别碰我
- I'll do it. - I'm fine. Don't touch me.

557
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,860
想点别的  分散注意力
Better think of something else.

558
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,090
试着佯装享受这感觉  明白吗
Just try and pretend like you're not going to enjoy this, all right?

559
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,710
别碰我
Leave it!

560
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,700
里昂提斯
Leontes!

561
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,760
看
Look.

562
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,070
快动手
Now!

563
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,230
好了
There we go.

564
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,380
你能控制它了
So you can control it.

565
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,940
我就说吧  你是个天使
See? You are an angel.

566
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,760
我考虑了所有证词
I've considered all that's been said.

567
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,110
有人曾遭遇了巨大的痛苦
There has been enormous suffering.

568
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,910
我不该有所袒护
There shall be no favours.

569
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,900
判罚必须公正
The punishment must be both fitting

570
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,490
并且适当
and appropriate!

571
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,830
摩根  求求你
Morgan, please!

572
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,090
闭嘴
Quiet.

573
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,180
你必须受点皮肉之苦
You need to accept this.

574
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,020
烧死她
Burn her!

575
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,630
烧死她  好样的  复仇天神
Burn her! Yes! Vengeance!

576
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,780
这就是你要求的惩戒
That is your retribution.

577
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,700
这不够  她必须被处决
It is not enough. She must be executed.

578
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,060
-我已做出了判决  -我女儿丢了性命
- I've given my decision. - My daughter died!

579
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,410
-那是无心之失  -那祭典呢
- That was a mistake! - What about the rituals?

580
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:21,660
其他被害的女孩呢
The other girls who died?

581
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,950
没有其他女孩被害
No girls died.

582
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,220
她说过有其他女孩被选过
She said they were chosen!

583
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,310
你可不知道被选是什么意思
You have no idea what it means to be chosen.

584
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,530
不得挑衅我的权威
I will not be challenged!

585
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,690
你想让她感受你的痛苦
You want her to feel your pain?

586
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,270
她现在每天都将感同身受
She will now. Every day.

587
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,090
你想用她的命偿还你女儿的命
You want her life for your daughter's?

588
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,110
我不接受
I don't accept that.

589
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:46,070
她已受到了惩罚  你也得到了你的复仇
She has her punishment. You have your retribution.

590
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,880
现在走吧  否则我就要叫守卫了
Now go, or face my guards.

591
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,970
还有人质疑我的决定吗
Does anyone else wish to dispute my decision?

592
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,880
真美
It is beautiful.

593
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,940
我们会让它更将辉煌
We'll make it more than that...

594
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,690
它将成为后世引以为豪的圣地  我保证
Make it a place to be proud of, I promise.

595
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,940
我相信你
I believe you.

596
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,660
谢谢
Thank you.

597
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:46,380
很好  这正是我们需要的
Well done. It's exactly what we need.

598
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,340
一个可以思考的地方
A place to think.

599
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,010
举国上下都将如此
The whole nation will be that.

600
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,720
那里怎么样
What was it like?

601
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,870
很美
It was beautiful.

602
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,210
谢谢您沿途如此照顾我的妻子
Thank you for taking such great care of my wife on the journey.

603
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,380
我很庆幸是您一路护送她
If it had to be anyone, I'm grateful it was you.

604
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,290
荣幸之至  很遗憾此行的目的有些伤感
It was my honour. I'm sorry it wasn't for a happier occurrence.

605
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,030
好了  还有很多事要做呢
Right, well, we've still got a lot of work to do.

606
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,110
高文  布拉提斯
Gawain, Brastias,

607
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,780
带30个人去东边的山谷
take 30 men out to the valley in the east.

608
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,410
插上我们的徽旗
Plant banners every mile.

609
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,700
在树林里停下时
When you stop in the woods,

610
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,250
要让人们知道你们在做什么
let everyone know what you're doing.

611
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,360
让他们相互转告  他们将受到保护
Tell them to spread the they are protected.

612
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,890
我们才刚回来啊
We've only just got back.

613
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,440
国王有令  布拉提斯
The King gave an order, Brastias.

614
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,240
快去准备徽旗
Gather up the banners.

615
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,900
我们去东边
We're moving east.

616
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,870
之前是不是有人说要重建屋顶来着
Did I hear of plans to rebuild the roof?

617
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:40,280
不  我改主意了
No, I've changed my mind.

618
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,110
屋顶将永不封闭
That roof must never be sealed.

619
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:45,040
永不加盖  如果我们抬头便能仰望天空
Never built over. If we look up and see the sky,

620
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,920
就不会忘记我们所效忠的人们
we'll never forget who we're serving.

621
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,890
就永远不会跟外界隔绝
Never be disconnected from the world outside.

622
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,260
我喜欢这说法
I like that.
