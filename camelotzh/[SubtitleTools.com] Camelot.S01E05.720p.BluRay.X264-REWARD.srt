梅林走多久了
How long has Merlin been gone?

17
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,100
上次见他是四天前的事了
Four nights since we last saw him.

18
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,390
你觉得他会回来吗
Do you think he's coming back?

19
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,740
-不知道  -他为你取来了宝剑
- I don't know. - He got you that sword.

20
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,840
他不会就此弃你不顾的
He wouldn't just desert you after that.

21
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,350
要是梅林的话  一切皆有可能
Can't predict anything when it comes to Merlin.

22
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,940
你觉得他有计划吗  他知道他在做什么吗
Do you think he has a plan? Really knows what he's doing?

23
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,550
希望有吧
Huh! I hope so.

24
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,560
或许我们该停下  等雨停了再走
Maybe we should stop. Wait till it passes.

25
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,530
得了吧  这么点雨就难住我们的国王了
Come on. Don't tell me the king's worried by a bit of rain.

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,530
骑马再走几个小时就到卡米洛特了
Camelot's only a few hours' ride away.

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,040
我们得继续前进  走吧  我们比赛
We should keep going. Come on, I'll race you. Ya!

28
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,070
停停停
Stop, stop, stop!

29
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,390
你还好吗
Are you all right?

30
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,890
帮帮我  有人要杀我父亲
Help me! My father, he's going to kill him!

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,560
在哪儿  带我们去
Where? Show us.

32
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,270
走哪边
Which way?

33
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,570
-那边  -我们走  驾
- That way. - Come on. Ya!

34
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,890
驾  快走
Ya! Come on!

35
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,660
-那边  -快走
- Over there! - Come on! Ya!

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
把他吊起来
Take him up!

37
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,170
-放开他  -父亲
- Let him go! - Father!

38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,110
放开他  这是你们国王的命令
Let him go! Your king demands it!

39
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,280
好吧  放他下来  放他下来
All right, take him down! Take him down!

40
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,450
-父亲  -帮我扶他进去
- Father! - Help me get him inside.

41
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,120
-为什么  他是个杀人犯  -照我说的做
- Why? He's a murderer! - You do as I say!

42
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,320
他杀了我哥哥  他该被吊死在这树上
He's murdered my brother! He should be hanging from this tree!

43
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,620
我们做的是正义之事
We're just taking what's right here.

44
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,790
没有国王的命令你们不能为所欲为
You'll take nothing without word from your king!

45
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,960
-这村叫什么  -埃斯汉姆  陛下
- What village is this? - Exham, sire.

46
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,870
这不需劳您大驾
Well, this needn't concern you.

47
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,040
我们可以处理自己的问题
We deal with our own problems.

48
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,970
我们不想耽搁您的行程
We don't want to detain you.

49
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,140
对不起  父亲  对不起
I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry.

50
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,650
-这是怎么回事  -我们发现他
- How did this start? - We caught him

51
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,650
在我哥哥的尸体旁  手里拿着石头
over my brother's body with a rock in his hand and blood

52
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,070
脸上还有血迹  我们都看到了
on his face. We all saw it,

53
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,020
对吧  大伙儿  他是杀人凶手  陛下
didn't we, lads? He's a murderer, sire.

54
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,110
我们只是想伸张正义
We just want what's right.

55
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,720
我们都希望如此
Then we both agree on that.

56
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,360
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

57
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,060
凯特琳
Katelyn.

58
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,400
求你了
Please.

59
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,330
别让他们这么做
Don't let them do this.

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,970
-这里的头领是谁  -我哥哥  韦德
- Who's the head man here? - My brother, Wade,

61
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,370
被这人杀害的那个人  就是这里的头领
the man he killed, he was head man.

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,310
现在应该是我了  大家都叫我尤恩
I suppose it falls to me now. They call me Ewan.

63
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,580
找几个人陪你
Choose a few men to accompany you.

64
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,250
-陪我  去哪儿  -卡米洛特
- Accompany me? Where? - Camelot.

65
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,490
等他恢复到可以为自己辩护了
You'll present your grievances

66
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,490
你可以向他声讨正义
against this man once he's fit to talk for himself.

67
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,320
陛下  我们可以自己处理好
I'm telling you, sire, we can deal with this on our own.

68
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,330
你们不需要这么做
And I'm telling you you don't need to!

69
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,990
你被复仇冲昏头脑时
You can't dispense justice

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
是不可能做到公平公正的
when your mind is clouded by revenge!

71
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,600
遵命  您听到所发生的事后
Of course. When you hear what happened, you'll come

72
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,010
会做出正确的决定的
to the right decision.

73
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,140
好  去选你的人
Yeah, then choose your men.

74
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,040
明早我们会在卡米洛特详细了解此事
We'll hear it all at Camelot tomorrow morning.

75
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,640
你确定要这么做吗
Are you sure about this?

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,480
此地并非卡米洛特的领地
Camelot's shadow only stretches so far.

77
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,510
那今天就会扩张了
Then today it stretches a little further.

78
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,850
我们走
Come on.

79
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,630
还是觉得很难控制吗
Still finding it hard to control?

80
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,910
你无权随心所欲的在我身边晃悠
You do not have the liberty to walk in on me whenever you please.

81
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,910
我的善心没到这个程度
Charity doesn't extend that far.

82
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,910
是这样吗  善心而已
Is that what it is? Charity?

83
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,920
我不需要你  西比尔  再也不需要你了
I don't need you for anything, Sybil. Not anymore.

84
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,880
哦  我觉得你需要
Oh, I think you do.

85
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,560
看看你  被一群陌生人围绕着
Look at you here, surrounded by strangers.

86
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,890
我是唯一真正了解你的人
I'm the only one who truly understands you.

87
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,730
为什么是伊格兰
Why Igraine?

88
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,500
我很好奇  为什么是她
Why her, I wonder?

89
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,240
很明显啊
It's very clear.

90
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,380
这样我可以进入卡米洛特  接近亚瑟
So I can get into Camelot, get close to Arthur,

91
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,340
然后杀了他
and kill him.

92
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,210
然后呢
But then what?

93
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,280
然后我会登上王位  那本来就是属于我的
And then I take the crown, which is rightfully mine.

94
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,220
再然后呢
And after that?

95
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,790
一如既往  你还是不够深谋远虑
As usual, you haven't thought far enough ahead.

96
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,890
我的时间全用来思考了
I have done nothing but think.

97
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,560
你没有  你需要朋友
No you haven't. You need friends.

98
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,530
-我不需要  -盟友
- No, I don't. - Allies.

99
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,770
我试过和人结盟  但失败了
I tried an alliance. It failed.

100
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,400
摩根  没有朋友与盟友
Morgan, without allies and friends, the throne will be

101
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,040
在你坐上王位前  它就会被人夺走了
taken from you before you even sit in it.

102
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,150
你对政治一无所知
You know nothing about politics.

103
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,520
没人知道你  摩根
Nobody knows you, Morgan.

104
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,560
他们都知道亚瑟  但不知道你是谁
They all know of Arthur, but not you.

105
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,560
他们知道我是尤瑟的女儿
They know I'm Uther's daughter.

106
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,230
尤瑟的女儿  亚瑟的姐姐
Uther's daughter, Arthur's sister--

107
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,230
你不能总是通过别人来定义自己
you can't be defined by others.

108
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,230
人们需要了解你本人
People need to know you for yourself.

109
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,530
我不会再和军阀达成协议了
I won't form any more pacts with warlords.

110
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,770
不是军阀  是商人和长者们
Not warlords; merchants; village elders.

111
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,140
商人和长者
Merchants and village elders?

112
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,070
这些人该成为我的盟友
These should be my allies?

113
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,710
他们是普通人  而且有影响力
They are ordinary and they are influential.

114
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,680
我跨海而来
I travelled here across the sea,

115
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,760
一路上  我留意过他人的言论
and all that way, I listened to the talk.

116
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,590
没人提起过你
Nobody talks of you.

117
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,590
有人谈论过亚瑟
Some talk of Arthur.

118
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,100
但绝大多数人都在谈论自己的恐慌
But most talk about their fear.

119
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,730
他们再也不认识自己的国家了
They don't recognize their country anymore,

120
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,670
这让他们很恐惧
and it frightens them.

121
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,980
恐惧是最有力的武器
There is nothing more powerful than fear.

122
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,610
你还记得恐惧的感觉吗
You remember what it's like to be frightened.

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,950
还记得当有人来帮你驱走那恐惧时
And when someone comes, takes that fear away,

124
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,050
你是多么敬爱他们
how you love them for it.

125
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,450
多么崇拜他们吗
How you worship them.

126
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,090
因此  你需要结交新朋友
So you will make new friends.

127
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,130
届时人们谈论的就将是摩根女士了
And then all the talk will be of the Lady Morgan.

128
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,570
赞颂她了解民生疾苦
How she understands the suffering of the people,

129
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,230
赞颂她是他们亲密的朋友
how she is their friend,

130
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,240
同情她合法的王位
and how she has been robbed

131
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,810
被人野蛮的抢走
of her legitimate claim to the crown.

132
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,210
他们不会认为我在分担他们的痛苦
They won't see that I share their suffering;

133
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,210
他们只会把我当做亚瑟的狗腿
they'll see me as Arthur's lackey,

134
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
认为我在试探是否有叛徒
sniffing out traitors.

135
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,380
你只需做到热情好客  平易近人就行了
You'll be welcoming and gracious,

136
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,720
其他事自会迎刃而解
and the rest will take care of itself.

137
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,660
他们就快到了
They'll be here soon.

138
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,990
你什么意思
What do you mean?

139
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,760
昨晚我发出了些请柬
I had invitations sent out last night.

140
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,560
你得盛情款待他们
You're giving quite a feast in their honour.

141
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,630
摩根小姐待客如此慷慨  一如其善心
The Lady Morgan's hospitality is bountiful, like her charity.

142
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,440
你太自作主张了
You're giving far too many orders.

143
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,010
就放纵我这一次吧
Indulge me just this once.

144
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,680
如果失败了  就赶我走吧
If it fails, turn me out.

145
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,810
戴这条
Wear this one.

146
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,000
不是吧  又来了
Not again.

147
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,740
走开
Away.

148
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,540
人越来越多了
More people.

149
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,680
他们睡在哪儿啊
Where are they supposed to sleep?

150
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,710
谁负责组织这里
Who's organizing this?

151
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,380
问得好  你觉得呢  小羊
Good question. What do you reckon, goat?

152
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,480
你的山羊又闯进我房间了
Your goat was in my chambers again.

153
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,390
这星期已经是第二次了
That's the second time this week.

154
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,220
-抱歉  女士  -看好你的羊
- Sorry, My Lady. - Keep your goat under control.

155
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,890
梅林
Merlin?

156
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,600
不
No!

157
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,030
现在不行
Not now.

158
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,070
还不是时候
Not a good time right now.

159
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,080
让我一个人呆着
Leave me alone.

160
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,160
这事你打算这么处理
How are we going to judge this?

161
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,010
到大厅见我  带上高文  欧菲尔斯
Meet me in the hall with Gawain, Ulfius,

162
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,230
布拉提斯和里昂提斯
Brastias, and Leontes.

163
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,870
我会告诉你们怎么做的
I'll explain how it'll work.

164
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,170
真希望梅林在
I wish Merlin were here.

165
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,600
你是将军  我是国王  我们不需要他
You're the marshal. I'm the king. We don't need him.

166
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,440
我知道我们在做什么  去叫人吧
I know what we do. Fetch the men.

167
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,280
-殿下  -桂妮维尔
- Your Highness. - Guinevere.

168
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,310
你可能注意到了  有点问题
You might have noticed there's a problem.

169
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,080
每天有越来越多的人前来  这很好
Every day more people come, which is good,

170
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,350
但我们仍像住在临时居所里一样
but we're still living like it's temporary,

171
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,580
可这儿并非临时居所
which it isn't.

172
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,620
我们是要在此长期生活的  对吗
We're here to stay, right?

173
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,890
是的  所以呢
Right. So?

174
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,660
这里没有秩序可言
Well, there's no order.

175
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,430
我们怎么养活这么多人  他们在哪睡觉
How do we feed people? Where do they sleep?

176
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,120
这里的人都有所需求
Everybody here needs something,

177
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,900
但是他们也可以有所奉献
but they can also offer something.

178
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,470
我打算把这里弄得井井有条
I'm going to make everything more organized.

179
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,130
除非您反对
Unless you object.

180
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,770
我不反对  祝你好运
I don't object. You have my blessing.

181
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,880
尤瑟遇害
Uther's murder...

182
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,010
王国无主
...robbed the country of its king.

183
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,720
旧的秩序被打破
The old certainties are gone.

184
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,520
新的秩序正在建立
A new beginning is being forged.

185
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,190
一切都在变化当中
And while everything is changing,

186
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,280
在此动荡之时
in such flux, it's...

187
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,770
很容易令人觉得  被忽视了
it's easy to feel... overlooked.

188
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,240
我不希望你们觉得自己被遗忘了
I don't want you to think that you're being forgotten.

189
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,470
我愿向你们证明  我是你们的朋友
I would like to prove myself a friend,

190
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,480
我向你们保证  你们有任何
and assure you that any fears

191
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,680
恐惧或是麻烦
or questions you may have

192
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,720
都可以向我倾诉
can be safely shared with me.

193
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,720
说吧  大人  我们得马上说出实情
Now, Lord, we need to speak the truth, now!

194
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,460
我们感激国王陛下的姐姐
We are all grateful to the king's sister

195
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,030
如此的恩典和仁慈  但我代表大家表示
for her grace and kindness. But I speak for us all

196
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,940
我们对亚瑟的统治都真心感到满足和欣喜
when I say we are truly content and rejoice in Arthur's rule.

197
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,540
我也是
As do I.

198
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,550
在卡米洛特设立法庭
Tribunals for justice here at Camelot?

199
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,320
我们处于王国的中央
We're at the center of the realm.

200
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,050
我们的价值观应该传播到每一个村落去
Our values have to spread out into every community.

201
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,090
这些村落都有他们自己的习俗了
These communities already have their own way of doing things.

202
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,090
我们也看到他们的习俗了
We saw their way of doing things.

203
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,500
他连为自己辩护的机会都没有就会被杀了
He'd have been dead before he had a chance to defend himself.

204
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,940
那你要我们做什么
So why do you need us?

205
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,930
国王应当独立进行裁决
Surely a king sits alone in matters of judgment.

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,880
再说  我们有何资格评判他人
And anyway, who are we to judge?

207
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,700
我们自己都杀人如麻
We all kill plenty.

208
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,270
建立这个法庭是为了查明缘由
The purpose of the tribunal is to discover the cause.

209
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,410
亚里士多德归结人行为的七大缘由
Aristotle's seven causes:

210
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,580
巧合  天性  强迫  习惯
chance, nature, compulsion, habit,

211
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,510
理智  激情和欲望
reason, passion, and desire.

212
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,720
你说有人看到凶手打死人了
You said the killer was seen delivering the blow.

213
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,190
要是这样  探寻缘由还有何意义
What does cause matter if that was the case?

214
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,850
缘由很重要
Cause is everything.

215
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,820
我们不知道谁先动的手  谁是正当防卫
We don't know who attacked who, who acted in self-defence.

216
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,080
如果我们能查明打斗的缘由
If we discover the cause of the fight,

217
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,830
就能推测出真相
we'll reason the truth.

218
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,120
我们要一起讨论听到的证词  并作出决定
We'll discuss what we've heard and decide,

219
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,030
无论判他无罪还是有罪  都一起决定
innocent or guilty, together as one.

220
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,360
惩罚方式呢  也一起决定吗
And what about punishment? To be decided by all of us?

221
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,500
不  这个责任我自己来担
No, that burden shall be mine alone.

222
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,210
交出你们的武器
Surrender your blades.

223
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,780
你们所有人
All of you.

224
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,780
你的剑
Your sword.

225
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,620
-我们不想惹事  -那就用不上匕首
- We don't want any trouble. - Then you won't need the dagger.

226
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,760
你过去后  待着别说话  懂吗
You stay silent in there. Understand?

227
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,570
科尔弗请站在这里  凯特琳  坐吧
Colfur, stand, please. Katelyn, take a seat.

228
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,720
陛下  说真的  我们不想
Sire, really, we don't want to

229
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,370
这样浪费您的时间
waste your time like this.

230
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,370
我们知道如何处理我们村的事务
We know how to deal with our own affairs.

231
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,370
您这样关注我们让我们深感不安
We're embarrassed to have your eyes on us

232
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,380
您一定还有许多其他事物要处理
when there must be so much else you could be doing.

233
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,950
你不用不安  我们就是来处理此事的
You don't need to be embarrassed. This is what we're here to do.

234
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,850
此次听证会的目的是处理埃斯汉姆村
The purpose of this hearing is to address the murder

235
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,590
头领韦德被杀一案  并对此案中被目击
of Exham's head man, Wade, and decide upon a suitable punishment

236
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,790
袭击被害人的科尔弗  做出适当的判罚
for the man who was seen to attack him, Colfur.

237
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,570
今天是卡米洛特的首次听证会
Today is our first hearing in Camelot.

238
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,870
我相信以后还会有更多的
I'm sure there'll be many more.

239
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,370
作为你们的国王
As you king,

240
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,270
我旨在让整个国家的公平正义
it is my intention to apply the justice

241
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,540
始于今日
throughout the realm that begins here today.

242
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,550
尤恩  你先说
Ewan, you speak first.

243
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,250
讲讲你们村和你的哥哥韦德的事
Tell us about your village and your brother, Wade.

244
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,220
我不知该从何说起
Well, I don't know where to begin.

245
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,890
我哥哥是个好人
My brother was a good man.

246
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,260
我们的村子很平静
Our village is quiet.

247
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,560
在他出现以前  我们从没有过
We never had any trouble till the likes of him

248
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,500
任何纷争
came along.

249
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,270
此话怎讲
And why is that?

250
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,670
他就爱唱反调
Well, he's a naysayer, isn't he?

251
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,210
总是抱怨这  抱怨那
Always complaining about something.

252
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,710
总想纠结人一起惹是生非
Trying to band people together, cause trouble.

253
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,250
你对此有何解释
What do you have to say to that?

254
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,250
我爱说什么就说什么
I don't guard my words.

255
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,920
别人爱听则听  反之亦然
Them that like it, like it. Them that don't, don't.

256
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,420
你们是怎么打起来的
Why did the fight start?

257
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,070
重要的是怎么结束的
All that matters is how it finished,

258
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,660
韦德罪有应得
and Wade got what was coming to him.

259
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,830
如果你是想问谁先动手的  是我
But if you're asking who landed the first blow, it was me.

260
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,130
韦德最初为何会去找你
Why did Wade come to see you in the first place?

261
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,170
他向我哥哥租地  他欠了他租金
He rented land from my brother. He owed him tithes.

262
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,270
他都几个月没交租了
Well, he hadn't seen hide nor hair of payment in months.

263
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,570
韦德是因为这个去找你吗  去收租
Is that why Wade was there? To collect his tithes?

264
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,150
如果是  我没打算给他钱
If he was, I wasn't of a mind to pay him.

265
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,420
你住在他的土地上  你该给他钱的
You were on his land, you should pay him.

266
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,990
我放个屁还给他吧
He can have the steam off my shite before I give him anything!

267
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,490
你听到了吗
You see?

268
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,790
我哥一年前就可以把他赶走了
My brother could have thrown him off that land a year past.

269
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,690
他有这打算
He had a mind to.

270
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,700
可他心太软了
He was too soft.

271
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,500
好心却没好报啊
Well, look where it got him.

272
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,000
不必多费唇舌  我不感兴趣
Before you open your mouth, I'm not interested.

273
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,070
救赎的事还是省省吧
Past saving.

274
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,680
我不是来救赎你的
I'm not here to save you.

275
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,350
怎么称呼
What do I call you?

276
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,650
托莫尔  你呢
Tomal. You?

277
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,690
你是个雇佣兵
Am I right in thinking

278
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,190
我没说错吧
you're a mercenary?

279
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,830
没错
Yes.

280
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,070
你身手好吗
Are you a good one?

281
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,510
至少我还活着
I'm still alive.

282
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,210
-你要杀谁  -我不想杀任何人
- Who do you want killed? - I don't want anyone killed.

283
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,580
那干嘛
What, then?

284
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,120
把人打到能看出伤痕和血迹就行了
The sort of attack that leaves marks and blood.

285
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,650
-好办  但为何  -干嘛  你还管这个
- Easy. But why? - What, do you care?

286
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,460
不管
No.

287
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,730
那我们就算说定了
Then we understand each other.

288
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,300
这世界是怎么了啊
What's happening to this world?

289
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,300
会变成地狱的
It's goin' to hell.

290
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,370
上帝会解脱我们的
God will deliver us.

291
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,230
不见得
I doubt it.

292
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,210
告诉我你想打谁
But tell me who you want beaten.

293
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,580
我
Me.

294
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,690
来吃的了
Food.

295
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,890
你在干嘛啊
What are you doing?

296
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,460
我需要一个房间  我连个房间都没有
I needed a room. Didn't have a room.

297
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,000
到处都好吵
Too much noise everywhere else.

298
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,030
到处人声鼎沸
Noise and people.

299
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,940
这都是你弄的吗
Is this all you?

300
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,900
我需要思考
Needed to think.

301
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,870
最近都没时间思考了
Haven't had time to think lately.

302
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,980
你在颤抖
You're shaking.

303
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,610
梅林  你在流汗
Merlin, you're sweating.

304
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,780
事后总会这样
That always happens afterwards.

305
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,420
什么事后
After what?

306
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,590
你做了什么
After what?

307
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,390
这些伤是怎么来的
How did you get those injuries?

308
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,790
我自找的
I asked for them.

309
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,500
梅林  你说的我都听不懂
Merlin, you're not making any sense.

310
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,130
巫师不需要被理解
Wizards don't need to.

311
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,170
亚瑟在大堂  在主持一场审讯
Arthur's in the great hall, holding a trial.

312
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,100
他干嘛啊
What's he doing that for?

313
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,070
则就是我想说的
This is what I mean.

314
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,140
不管你计划得多好  人们总是
Plan all you like, but people...

315
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,040
没错  人们总会来加以阻碍
Yes, they get in the way.

316
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,150
出来吧
Come outside.

317
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,890
不行  不  不  不  不  不
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

318
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,420
还有很多事要做
Too much to do.

319
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,630
梅林  亚瑟需要你
Merlin, Arthur needs you!

320
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,030
他需要你
He needs you!

321
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,940
好了  陛下
Well, Sire,

322
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,370
该听的您都听到了
you've heard everything you need to hear.

323
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,940
科尔弗承认是他先动手  我们都看到了
Colfur admits he started the fight, and we all saw him

324
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,940
他杀韦德  此事毫无争议
kill Wade. There's no dispute here.

325
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,180
我们需要了解缘由才能做出公平的判罚
We need to understand the reason to fairly decide the punishment.

326
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,120
缘不缘由有什么关系
What's reason got to do with any of this?

327
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,980
不可对国王不敬  你会得到你要的正义的
Respect the king and you'll get your justice.

328
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,360
是因为你不肯向韦德缴租才起的争执吗
Did the fight start because you refused to pay Wade his tithe?

329
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,430
-回答国王的问话  -有什么意义
- Answer the king! - Why?

330
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,130
我在试着理解事情的始末
I'm trying to understand.

331
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,430
他来找我  我们打起来了
He came to me, we fought,

332
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,100
我用块石头把他脑袋砸烂了  就是这样
I smashed his head in with a rock. That's the fact of it.

333
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,970
你宁可被处死  也不肯说实话吗
Would you rather be executed than talk?

334
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,870
说不说有什么用
You think talking will make a difference?

335
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,710
你只是在利用我显示自己多公正
You're just using me here to test your justice.

336
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,380
这事完了以后你还会保护我们吗  不会
Are you going to stand guard when all this is over? No!

337
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,150
所以说不说都一样
So no point in talking!

338
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,380
陛下  这么做有什么用啊
Sire, what difference does any of this make?

339
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,920
我哥哥已经死了  他也该死
My brother's dead, and he deserves the same fate!

340
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,190
安静
Silence!

341
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,560
我们得休息一下
We need a break.

342
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,400
去吃点东西
Go get some food.

343
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,200
就是桩谋杀案  相互报复而已
It's murder. An eye for an eye.

344
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,670
-高文你说呢  -他交不起租
- Gawain? - He couldn't pay his tithe,

345
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,340
就杀了头领  这是冷血的谋杀
so he killed the head man. It's execution.

346
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,650
但科尔弗并没承认这一点
You know, Colfur didn't admit that.

347
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,310
他说的是如果韦德是去收租的
He said IF Wade was there for that,

348
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,280
他也不会给他
he wouldn't have been of a mind to pay him.

349
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,120
-这不一样吗  -不一样
- Same thing. - It's not.

350
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,690
你第二次问他的时候  他没回答
When you asked him again, he didn't respond.

351
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,590
如果韦德去找他是为了别的什么呢
What if Wade was there for something else?

352
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,510
亚瑟  这事已经太费神了
Arthur, this is becoming a distraction.

353
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,900
我们还有很多事要做呢
We have plenty we need to do.

354
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,950
处决了科尔弗  然后我们该干嘛干嘛吧
Execute Colfur, and let's get back to work.

355
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,800
你还是会被看做是一位强大的领导者
You'll still be seen as a strong leader.

356
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,300
她为什么要跑
Why did she run?

357
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,440
我们最初看到她的时候
When we first saw her?

358
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,640
她跑去求助吧
She was running for help.

359
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,570
不
No.

360
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,580
她是在逃跑
She was running away.

361
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,880
她的父亲正被攻击
Her father was being attacked.

362
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,380
她为什么不跑去其他村庄呢
Why didn't she go to any of the other villages?

363
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,620
当你问起科尔弗  韦德为什么去找他时
When you asked Colfur why Wade was there,

364
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,650
他和凯特琳对视了一眼
there was this look between Colfur and Katelyn.

365
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,590
似乎他不想让她说话
It was like he wanted to be sure she wouldn't speak.

366
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,940
摩根
Morgan!

367
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,900
天啊
Oh, my Lord!

368
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,970
西比尔
Sibyl.

369
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,920
我们在林子里找到她
She was found in the woods.

370
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,970
大家让开
Get away from her.

371
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,820
把她抬到她床上
Let's get her to her bed.

372
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,550
不  去我房间
No, my chamber.

373
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,060
连修女都被打了
The holy mother beaten

374
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,170
我们都不安全
none of us are safe.

375
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,950
快  去拿水和布
Run, fetch water and cloths!

376
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,230
他们看到了...
They see...

377
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,200
...你在和他们一起经受痛苦
...that you suffer with them.

378
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,600
还说我不懂政治吗
Now tell me I know nothing about politics.

379
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,910
别浪费时间  孩子
Don't waste the moment, child.

380
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,450
好好利用这机会
Use it.

381
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,610
去吧
Go.

382
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,590
去啊
Go.

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,060
我需要帮助
I need help.

384
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,130
你需要女人出马
You want a woman's touch?

385
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,470
是
Mm.

386
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,070
她不是求助而是逃生
She ran instead of getting help.

387
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,970
这没道理
It doesn't make sense.

388
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,540
我必须确定
I have to be sure.

389
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,510
我必须确定他是有罪  才能判他死刑
I can't sentence a man to death unless I'm sure.

390
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,680
他杀了另一个男人
He killed another man.

391
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,680
为何审判他会如此困扰你
Why does sentencing him bother you so much?

392
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,320
因为我想让我们的判决
Because I want our justice

393
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,050
比以前更严明  更公正
to be better than what's gone before.

394
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,540
因为我想  有时候
And because I think that sometimes maybe

395
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,690
人也许会为正当理由而犯错
people do the wrong thing for the right reasons.

396
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,840
这儿很美
It is beautiful.

397
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,540
我有时会来这里思考
I sometimes come here to think.

398
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,840
我以前从没见过大海
I've never seen the sea before.

399
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,120
亚瑟是个好人
Arthur's a good man.

400
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,580
他愿意倾听人们的疾苦
He listens to the people.

401
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,420
他真的关心大家
He really cares.

402
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,820
他帮不了我  没人帮得了
He can't help me. No one can.

403
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,730
这是我的错
It's my fault.

404
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,700
为什么
Why?

405
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,230
我逃跑了
I ran.

406
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,230
我父亲叫我快跑
My father told me to.

407
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,100
我们知道韦德快来了
We knew Wade was coming.

408
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,070
他来干嘛
What was he coming for?

409
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,880
我们的头领会享有每个女孩的贞操
The head man takes every girl as she becomes a woman.

410
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,610
不可能
No!

411
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,280
就是这回事
It's the way.

412
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,620
难道没人阻止吗
Do people not try and stop this?

413
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,090
我们斗不过韦德和尤恩的家族
You don't stand against Wade and Ewan's kin.

414
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,470
伊格兰说得对
Igraine was right.

415
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,530
是  这就是原因
Yes, this is why.

416
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,970
被她发现了
Heh... She finds out,

417
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,020
现在来打扰的人没完没了
and now it's an endless stream of visitors

418
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,680
还偏偏是在我想要思考的时候
just when I'm trying to think.

419
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,840
还有谁来过
Who else has been here?

420
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,720
那不是重点
Hmm? That's not the point.

421
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,020
你是说只有我吗
Huh... You mean just me?

422
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,720
是我在没完没了的打扰你
An endless stream of me? Hm!

423
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,630
你想要什么
What is it you want?

424
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,160
你就这样独自待这里
You were here all alone.

425
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,130
我需要时间
I needed some time.

426
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,500
这是什么
What is this?

427
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,340
我想把一切都列出来
I wanted to lay it all out.

428
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,040
这些都是什么意思
What does it all mean?

429
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,180
那代表了第一波...
Oh, that just shows the first wave is...

430
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,150
...业已完成
...ostensibly complete.

431
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,930
但我们已经落后了
But we've fallen behind.

432
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,480
还有很多事情需要做
There's so much more to do.

433
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,180
比如建个图书馆
The library.

434
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,390
第一波  是什么意思
What do you mean, "First wave"?

435
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,350
就是带你来这里
Well, getting you here--

436
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,960
占领卡米洛特  招募人才
occupying Camelot, recruiting people.

437
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,150
你的审讯怎么样
How's your trial?

438
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,270
你来吗
Will you come?

439
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,050
不去
No.

440
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,970
为什么
Why?

441
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,410
因为你已有了计划
You had the big idea.

442
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,580
好好干吧
See it through.

443
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,440
我会的
I will.

444
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,040
很好
Good.

445
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,250
我很快就会好起来
I'll be fine soon.

446
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,390
我只需要...
I just needed...

447
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,690
...就像现在这样
...this.

448
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,230
我会关注你的
I'll be watching.

449
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,130
又被伏击
Yet another ambush.

450
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,050
这是个严重的问题...
This is a serious trouble...

451
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,810
...出门没有安全保障
...travel about without protection.

452
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,990
告诉女人们...
Tell the women...

453
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,150
摩根小姐
Lady Morgan.

454
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,300
我必须道歉
I must apologize.

455
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,760
不  不
No, no, no. No, no, no.

456
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,820
不必这样  她怎么样了
Not at all. How is she?

457
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,360
有人照料着她
She's being attended.

458
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,320
你们得原谅我
You'll have to forgive me.

459
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,650
她就像我的母亲
She's been a mother to me

460
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,370
从我小时候就开始照顾我
since I was a little girl.

461
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,960
怎么会这样
How can this happen?

462
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,040
请
Please.

463
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,380
喝吧
Drink.

464
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,650
谢谢
Thank you.

465
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,020
她的马有彭德拉根的标记
Her horse was carrying the Pendragon symbol.

466
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,190
她带了我们的印旗吗
She was wearing our colours?

467
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,630
但这本该能保护我们啊
But... but this is our protection.

468
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,630
我商旅途中一直执此印旗
I fly this banner along my trading routes.

469
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,670
但还是被袭击
It's still attacked.

470
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,530
这印旗飘遍我们的村庄
The banner is flown over my village,

471
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,740
可我们的粮仓还是被抢
and yet our grain stores are robbed,

472
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,100
我们的姑娘还是被掳走
our young women are taken.

473
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,710
到处都没王法  无法无天
There's no control. None at all.

474
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,280
我们都是忠诚的子民
We are all loyal subjects.

475
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,910
这...这...
Well, this... this...

476
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,920
...这可称不上保护
...this is not protection.

477
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,380
我们理解  他是您弟弟
We understand he is your brother.

478
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,090
但王土已然混乱
But the land moves further into chaos

479
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,060
并日趋恶化
every day.

480
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,160
这才是真相
And that is the real truth.

481
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,370
我不会听之任之
I will not let this happen.

482
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,300
我发誓
I will not!

483
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,070
还有人也感觉不公吗
Are there others who feel betrayed?

484
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,910
是的  有很多人
Yes, there are others.

485
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,750
我要代表我们所有人
I will send a messenger

486
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:51,580
送个信给我弟弟
to my brother to represent all of us.

487
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,550
当他知道这些  他会有所表示
When he knows of this, he will act.

488
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,960
我知道他会有所补偿  相信他
I know he will want to make redress. Have faith in him.

489
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,960
同时
In the meantime,

490
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,660
告诉其他有此遭遇之人
send word to others who feel this way.

491
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,360
叫他们今晚来彭德拉根的城堡
Tell them to come to Castle Pendragon tonight.

492
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,500
告诉他们国王会给大家一个答复
Tell them the king will come to his sister's call.

493
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,410
我要派人去送信吗
Shall I send for the messenger?

494
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,380
别麻烦了
Don't bother.

495
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,380
我们在等什么
So what are we waiting for?

496
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,000
他现在就该被处决了
He should be dead and buried by now.

497
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,560
和你的人一起等着
Go wait with your people.

498
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,250
这有何用
How does this help?

499
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,470
我拿起石头  砸了他的头
I got a rock, I smashed it on his head.

500
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,170
这是我自作自受
I deserve what I get.

501
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,540
大家必须了解实情
The people have to know.

502
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,250
我可以宽恕你  因为有正当理由
I can spare you; there was justification.

503
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,540
但大家得知道为什么
But the people have to know why.

504
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,920
不  我说过我不想那样
No. I've told you no.

505
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,970
如果你不说出来  这种事还会继续
If you don't speak about this, it will keep on happening.

506
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,740
那与我无关
That's not my responsibility.

507
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,810
那一切怎么会改变
Then how does anything ever change?!

508
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,400
没那么简单
It's not that simple.

509
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,080
为什么
Why?

510
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,490
你出去一下  凯特琳
Go out, Katelyn.

511
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,920
不
No.

512
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,260
出去  拜托
I said go out. Please.

513
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,770
韦德的家族...
Wade's family...

514
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,910
...拥有村庄所有的土地
...owns all the land the village is on.

515
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,940
每种庄稼的第一季收成都归他们
They get the first realm of every crop.

516
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,440
秋季  他们会开垦
They plough the first furrow

517
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,050
每个农场的第一条田沟
of every farm come autumn.

518
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,920
我结婚的前一晚
The night before my wedding,

519
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,320
韦德和尤恩的父亲来行使他的权利
Wade and Ewan's father claimed his tithe.

520
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:42,600
我不是本地人  我没听说过...
I was an outsider. I... I hadn't heard...

521
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:47,030
...头领可以享有每个女人的初夜
...head man was always the first for every woman.

522
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,810
凯特琳的母亲...在我们婚后两天...
Katelyn's mother... told me...

523
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,810
...告诉了我实情
...two days after we were married.

524
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,380
她生凯特林琳的时候死于难产
She died giving birth to Katelyn.

525
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,150
凯特琳  韦德和尤恩是...
Katelyn, Wade, and Ewan are...

526
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,120
...血亲
...kin.

527
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,160
韦德和尤恩并不在意
Wade and Ewan don't care.

528
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,260
那些兄弟占有了每个姑娘
Those brothers come for every girl.

529
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,250
你们为什么不离开呢
Then why didn't you leave?

530
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,960
我什么都没做错
I did nothing wrong!

531
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,870
你必须说出事实
You have to speak.

532
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,300
得阻止这样的事
This has to stop!

533
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,450
不行
I can't!

534
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,900
凯特琳不知道她不是我亲生的
Katelyn doesn't know she's not mine.

535
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,970
如果她知道了  我会永远失去她
If she knew, she... I'll have lost her!

536
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,710
看看我
Oh, look at me,

537
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,710
老大不小了  哭得像个小孩
a grown man, crying like a baby.

538
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,220
连结你们的不是血脉
It's not blood that ties you together;

539
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,690
而是你们共同的回忆
it's the memories you share.

540
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,670
是你教授她的一切
Everything you taught her,

541
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,960
是你为她放弃的一切
everything you gave up for her--

542
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,990
那是你的爱
that's your love;

543
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,230
那才是她所在意的
that's what flows through her.

544
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,170
告诉她  你会看到她有多爱你
Tell her and you'll see how much she loves you.

545
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,240
我知道的
I know.

546
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,070
你以为村里的姑娘们
You think the girls in the village

547
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,540
不会谈论这些吗
don't talk about this?

548
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,920
我一直都知道
I've always known.

549
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,190
但是...
And...

550
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,160
...我从没有因此而不爱你
...I never loved you any the less.

551
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:17,160
你...是我的父亲
You... are my father.

552
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,490
韦德过来想占有她
Wade had come for her.

553
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,060
我叫她逃跑
And I told her to run.

554
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,260
我叫她忘记我
I told her to forget me

555
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,270
远离我  有多远跑多远
and get away-- as far away as she could.

556
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,760
我告诉他  别靠近我女儿
I told him I'd kill him

557
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,370
不然就杀了他
before I'd let him near my girl.

558
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,380
那就是争斗的原因
That's how the fight started.

559
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,420
你有什么要说的吗
Have you anything to say?

560
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,920
这些我们都知道
We knew all this.

561
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,320
那是我们的生存之道
That's the way we live.

562
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,020
你们村的习俗
The customs of your village

563
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,660
将不再延续
are no longer acceptable.

564
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,660
头领比其他人更努力劳作
The head man works harder than anyone.

565
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,790
他有权享有第一次成果
He's entitled to first fruit,

566
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,800
至今没一个国王更改这习俗
and no Christian boy king is ever gonna change that.

567
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,730
今天就改
It changes today.

568
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,730
祝你好运
Oh, good luck.

569
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,100
现在  做判决吧
Now give your verdict.

570
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,290
科尔弗将因此而被逐出埃斯汉姆村
Colfur is hereby banished from the village of Exham.

571
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,190
你们回去收拾一下
You may return to collect your belongings.

572
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,960
然后永远离开该村
Then leave the village permanently.

573
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,860
-谢谢  -谋杀  只判驱逐
- Thank you. - Banishment! For murder?

574
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,140
只判驱逐
Banishment for murder

575
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,840
因为他的本意只是要保护女儿的名节
whilst trying to protect his daughter's honour.

576
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,400
听证会到此结束
The hearing is finished.

577
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,240
-很遗憾  -什么意思
- Well, that's a shame. - Why?

578
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,740
如果这就是卡米洛特秉持的正义
'Cause if that's Camelot justice...

579
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,910
那你在王位上坐不了多久了
...you'll be a short time on the throne.

580
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,820
他并没需要我
He didn't need me.

581
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,860
谢谢你关注他
Thank you for checking on him.

582
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,100
有一个女孩死去了
There was a girl and she died.

583
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,240
是我的错
And it was my fault.

584
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:19,140
我本以为我能控制自己的意念
I thought I could control what I was trying to do.

585
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,620
你太孤僻了
You keep yourself too alone.

586
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,550
你为何如此介怀
Why does it bother you?

587
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,190
因为有时我能隐约看到
Because sometimes I see glimpses

588
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,330
你将成为什么样的人
of the man you might be.

589
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,400
你这么做都是为了我
You did all this for me?

590
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,340
为了你  我愿意做任何事
There is nothing I wouldn't do for you.

591
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,750
你今晚必须爆发  孩子
You must blaze tonight, child.

592
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,720
这都是你应得的
It's all yours to take.

593
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,020
爆发吧
So blaze.

594
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,540
他们对女人们所做的事
What they do to the women...

595
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:33,210
你觉得在其他村会有同样的情况吗
Do you think it happens in other villages?

596
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,750
我不知道
I don't know.

597
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,120
也许吧
Maybe.

598
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,590
无论如何
Wherever it is...

599
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,690
我们都要加以阻止
...we have to stop it.

600
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,730
一定
We will.

601
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,200
谢谢
Thank you.

602
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:57,070
谢谢你去引导凯特琳
For what you did with Katelyn.

603
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,910
不必客气
You're welcome.

604
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,420
疼吗
Does it hurt?

605
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,050
-死不了  -骗子
- I'll be fine. - Liar.

606
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,060
你以前到底在伤口上擦了什么啊
What on earth did you use on it before?

607
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,060
-什么也没擦  -希望那剑值得你如此拼命
- Nothing. - Well, I hope that sword is worth it.

608
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,480
你为它受了这么多伤
After the amount of injuries you've got,

609
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,300
这剑最好能成为传奇
it had better become legendary.

610
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,170
那是把好剑  但要成为传奇
Ah, it's a great sword, but it'll only be...

611
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,870
必须用它做点传奇之事才行
...legendary if he does something legendary with it.

612
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,280
梅林
Merlin...

613
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,980
你到底是什么人
Who are you?

614
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,020
我该怎么回答
How am I supposed to answer that?

615
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:48,520
好吧  遇到亚瑟  甚至遇到乌瑟之前
All right, all right. Who were you before Arthur?

616
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,530
你是什么人
Before Uther?

617
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,030
跟现在一样
The same.

618
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,630
-你生在何处  -很重要吗
- Where were you born? - Does it matter?

619
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,870
不重要  但我好奇
It doesn't matter, but I'm interested.

620
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,080
你总是有所隐瞒
You hide.

621
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,810
即使再来这里之前  你也有所隐瞒
Even when you're not here, you hide.

622
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,750
-我无意隐瞒  -不  你有意
- I don't mean to. - Yes, you do.

623
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,750
那你呢
What about you?

624
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,890
你知道我的一切
You know everything about me.

625
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,720
康沃尔
Cornwall.

626
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,260
尤瑟
Uther.

627
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,890
然后到了这儿
Here.

628
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,060
但在康沃尔之前
But before Cornwall...

629
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,070
你又是什么样的人
Who were you then?

630
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,910
当时我很
I was...

631
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,180
坚强
...strong.

632
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,050
固执
Opinionated.

633
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,920
天真
Naive...

634
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,690
而且充满希望
...and full of hope.

635
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,790
生长在条件优渥之家
Living comfortably in a family with means.

636
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,360
你当时的梦想是什么
What did you dream of?

637
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,300
我梦想有一个能够平等待我的夫君
I dreamt of a husband who'd treat me as an equal.

638
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,940
你找到他了吗
Did you ever find him?

639
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,940
没有
No.

640
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,050
很遗憾
I'm sorry for that.

641
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,790
我也是
So am I.

642
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,710
-不行  -怎么了
- No! - What's the matter?

643
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,710
靠近我的人都会被焚烧致死
People who get close to me get burned.

644
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,880
你怎么会成为这种人的
How did you become such a man?!

645
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,890
-多上点酒  -是的  修女
- Be generous with the drink. - Yes, Holy Mother.

646
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,590
确保每个人都能吃好
Make sure everyone is well fed.

647
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:09,700
是你  你跟国王的姐姐同住
It's you. You live here with the king's sister?

648
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,970
不  我只是为了食物而来
No, I don't. I came for the food.

649
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,200
你在给侍女们下命令  你一定住在这里
You were giving orders to the servants. You live here.

650
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,970
为什么摩根的修女要付钱让我殴打她
Why does Morgan's nun pay me to beat the pulp out of her?

651
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,410
我需要一个栖身之所
I... needed a roof over my head.

652
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,280
这样能让他们心软
And this... persuaded them.

653
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,690
求你了  别对我妄加评判
Please. Don't judge me.

654
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,130
-东西都在这儿了吗  -是的  谢谢
- Is this everything? - Yes, sir. - Thank you.

655
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,530
你得赶不少路
You've got a lot of ground to cover.

656
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,010
最好别犯傻惹我出手
Don't make the mistake of taking me on.

657
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,540
我们有我们自己的规矩
You see, we have our own justice.

658
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,620
我也有我的  我母亲就曾被人强暴过
So do I. My mother knew what it was to be raped.

659
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,390
所以你们这种人  在我心里有着特殊的位子
So I keep a special place in my heart for people like you.

660
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,150
天高皇帝远  这里是我说了算
Your king doesn't rule around here; I do.

661
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,190
适可而止吧  多说多错
You the more you talk, the more trouble you're in.

662
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,890
我说科尔弗  你就是这种人么
So, Colfur, is this who you are?

663
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,530
躲在个毛头小子和他的武士身后
Hiding behind a boy king and his warriors? Eh, Colfur!

664
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,000
这个男人已经受到了处罚
This man has been banished!

665
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,840
我正在执行判决
And I'm carrying out his sentence.

666
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,600
请别妨碍我
Please don't get in my way.

667
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,920
我们有麻烦了
We have a problem.

668
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,360
-..杀了我哥哥  -我最后一次警告你
- ...killed my brother. - This is your last warning!

669
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,560
滚回家去
Go back to your dwellings.

670
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,260
怎么着  大个子
What the matter, big man?

671
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,700
不敢跟我们打吗
Are you afraid to fight?

672
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,550
你会得到应有的处罚
Ah, you'll get your rightful punishment.

673
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,550
你女儿也将履行她的义务
And your girl will get her due.

674
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,090
就是他
Him.

675
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,530
区区小事
This is not a problem.

676
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,230
各位
My people.

677
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,060
欢迎今晚来到彭德拉根的城堡
I welcome you tonight to Castle Pendragon.

678
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,630
国王呢  他来了吗
Where's the king? Has he come?

679
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,400
很遗憾  他公务繁忙  无暇理会我
I'm sorry to say that he was too busy to talk to me.

680
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,800
什么
What?

681
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,610
他把我的信使打发回来了
He sent my messenger back

682
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,980
说他太忙  无暇顾及我们的担忧
with word that he was too busy to address our concerns.

683
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,480
-太  太忙  -我理解你们的心情
- Too... too busy? - I share your frustration.

684
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,250
我也无法再粉饰太平了
I cannot pretend otherwise.

685
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,990
我现在觉得
It seems to me now...

686
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,590
我们正处于绝壁之上
...that we stand on the very brink.

687
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,090
过去在我父亲的庇护下的一切安定
Everything that was once so secure

688
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,130
现在都受到了威胁
under my father's reign is now under threat.

689
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,470
我们全都身陷险境
All of us are in danger.

690
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,670
我对我弟弟绝无二心
I am loyal to my brother,

691
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,640
但我为将来担心  非常担心
but I fear the future. I fear it.

692
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,310
我问自己  若是国王忙得无暇理会我们
And I ask myself, what do we mean to the king

693
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,950
那我们对他来说究竟算什么
if he's too busy for us?

694
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,140
总算来了啊
Finally!

695
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,860
别傻站着  帮忙啊
Well, don't just stand there! Help me!

696
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,200
我说过科尔弗将被驱逐出这里
You were told Colfur was to be banished!

697
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,030
你以为你的话在这还能管用
You think your words mean anything here,

698
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,000
这可不是任凭你为非作歹的地方
in the real world?

699
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,570
-你对这里毫无贡献  -好好看看
- You've done nothing here.  - Look around you.

700
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,140
这里不再是你的村庄了

我不会忙到置你们于不顾

我愿聆听你们的哀伤  并会感同身受

我在此发誓
I make an oath,

705
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,020
我向你们保证
a pledge to you all that I will

706
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,530
我将以血肉之躯全力保护你们

707
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,600
不列颠需要一个强大的领袖

你
You.

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,880
上来
Come here.

712
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,220
是他吗
Is this the man?

713
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,260
是的
Yes.

714
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,600
就是他打了我
That is the man who beat me.

715
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:15,400
不
No!

716
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,480
好
Yes!

717
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,480
我到哪都能活下来
I can go anywhere.

718
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,650
我可以东山再起  你阻止不了我
I can start again. You can't stop me.

719
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,080
你搬  我们会找到你

720
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,120
你逃  我们会追捕你
Run, and we'll hunt you.

721
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,760
无论你在哪  卡米洛特都将如影随形
Wherever you are, Camelot will be your shadow.

722
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:44,600
为了所有被你伤害过的女子
You deserve to die

723
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,600
让你死十次都不足惜
ten times over for every woman you've harmed.

724
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,930
够了  高文
That's enough, Gawain.

725
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,300
你真不值得我弄脏自己的剑
You're not worth the cloth and oil to clean the blades.

726
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,850
从今以后  这个村里所有的女人
From today, every woman in this village is protected

727
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,150
都将受到我的人  我的徽旗的保护
by my men, by my flag.

728
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,120
如果有任何女人  任何人受到伤害
If harm falls to any woman, to anybody,

729
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,750
他们都将知道
they will know.

730
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,130
埃斯汉姆现在是卡米洛特的一部分了
Exham is now part of Camelot.

731

此人代表着

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,730
所有曾令你们感到卑微  软弱  无能的人
who made you feel worthless, despised, and weak!

737
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,200

This man is every man who robbed you of your dignity

738
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:04,540
让你们因身为这个国家的一员而感到耻辱的人
and made you ashamed to belong to this once great nation!

739
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,880
我  摩根  尤瑟之女
I, Morgan, daughter of Uther...

740
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,790
将他交由你们处置
...give him to you.

741
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,900
现在  履行你们的正义吧
Now take your justice!
