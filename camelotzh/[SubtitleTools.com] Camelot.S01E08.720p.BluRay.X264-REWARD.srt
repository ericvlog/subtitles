31
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,170
坐下
Sit down.

32
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,950
你的忠心究竟有几分

33
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,440
对谁
To whom?

34
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,110
对摩根
To Morgan.

35
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,940
对这座城堡内所有的人
And to everyone within these walls.

36
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,680
我大半辈子都效命于此
I've served here most of my life.

37
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,500
摩根命令你毫无质疑的接受
Morgan requests that you accept my instructions

38
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,250
我的指令

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,450
她在哪儿

卡米洛特
At Camelot.

41
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,190
我们的国家正日趋混乱

42
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,550
她和她弟弟有些问题需要解决

43
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,440
于此同时
In the meantime,

44
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,900
我需要个信得过的人
I need someone I can trust.

45
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,100
你之前
What you said...

46
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,710
说的
...before.

47
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,240
你说的没错  我...
You were right. I...

48
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,410
应该更开放一点
...could be more open.

49
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,960
我  缺乏练习
I'm... out of practice.

50
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,670
你随时可以找我练习
You can always practice with me.

51
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,530
也许会的
Maybe I will.

52
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,050
摩根在哪
Where's Morgan?

53
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,510
她去哪儿了
Where is she?

54
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,690
求你  传个话
Please. Tell someone.

55
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,760
找个人来
Get someone.

56
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,400
求你  帮帮我
Please, help me.

57
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,890
回来  求你了
Come back. Please!

58
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,800
求求你
Please!

59
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,180

求求你  回来
Please! Come back!

62
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,430
此事只有你知我知
You and I are the only ones to know about this.

63
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,390
你宣誓过效忠于摩根
You swore that your loyalty to Morgan was absolute.

64
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,040
现在是证明你的忠心的时候了
Now prove it.

65
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,610
早安  夫人

69
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,120
夫人
Milady.

70
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,120
打扰了  夫人
Excuse me, milady,

71
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,900
这些要放哪里
where would you like these?

72
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,540
放在常放的地方就行了
Uh, the usual place will be fine.

73
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,590
-早安  -早安
- Good morning. - Good morning.

74
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,400
早安  夫人
Good morning, milady.

75
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,220

76

I saw. Thank you.

77
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,180
夫人
Madame.

78
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,070
早安
Good morning.

79
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,410
当然  我会通知手下  殿下
Yes, of course. I'll tell the men, Your Highness.

80
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,920
-早安  -早安  亚瑟
- Good morning. - Good morning, Arthur.

81
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,340
我想感谢你  感谢你在遇袭那晚
I never thanked you for your support

82
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,980
对我的支持
the other night during the attack.

83
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,840
你的支持好比雪中送碳
It was exactly what I needed.

84
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,900
应该的
Of course.

85
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,820
早安  桂妮维尔
Good morning, Guinevere.

86
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,400
这些事不用你来做的
You don't have to do that.

87
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,590
-我喜欢自己动手  -要帮忙吗
- I like doing it. - Can I help?

88
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,670
谢谢
Thank you.

89
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,920
在彭德拉根
What I said...

90
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,710
我所说的话
...at Pendragon...

91
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,050
我明白的
I know.

92
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,030
我不该说出来的
I shouldn't have said it.

93
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,700
但我是真心的
But I did mean it.

94
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,570
你吻了我
You kissed me.

95
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,850
你父亲死后  我们回程的路上
On our journey back, after your father's death.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,610
我只是出于悲伤
It was grief.

97
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,120
那一刻之前  我已埋葬了所有的情愫
I buried everything until that moment.

98
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,770
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,090
但你我之间绝无可能
But it will never happen.

100
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,020
我明白
I know.

101
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,060
很抱歉告诉你我的感受
I'm sorry for telling you.

102
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,700
我很欣慰你说了
I'm glad you did.

103
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,050
伊格兰  伊格兰
Igraine? Igraine!

104
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,130
-你去哪儿了  -怎么了
- Where have you been? - What do you mean?

105
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,060
我一直在等你
I've been waiting.

106
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,700
是啊  我太无礼了  真对不起
Of course. How rude of me! I'm sorry.

107
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,890
我...我之前有点事
I... had an errand to run.

108
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,490
卡米洛特正处于险境  只有你能救我们
Camelot's in danger. Only you can save us,

109
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,140
瑞德伍德阁下  我勇敢的真正的骑士
Sir Redwald, my brave and true knight.

110
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,710
别怕  伊格兰夫人
Fear not, my Lady Igraine,

111
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,940
我是您的护卫  卡米洛特会得救的
for I am your champion and Camelot will be saved.

112
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,030
那是我  他也是个孤儿
That's supposed to be me. He's an orphan, too.

113
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,900
-当然  -我降服了我们敌方
- Of course. - I faced down our enemy's

114
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,240
最厉害的战士  并战胜了他  是为了你
toughest warrior, and bested him. For you.

115
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,650
都是为了你
All for you.

116
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,570
好
Um. OK. Oh...

117
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,970
好吧
Um... OK...

118
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,650
你真是个勇敢的护卫  我要怎么回报你
Uh, you are a truly brave champion. How can I ever repay you?

119
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,170
现在我们该结婚  并永远在一起了
Now we shall be married and live together forever.

120
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,080
这就是结尾了
That's the end, really.

121
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,350
我喜欢结局圆满的故事
Well, I love a story with a happy ending.

122
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,060
这个结局非常完美
And that one is very happy.

123
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,310
等我长大
When I get older,

124
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,830
我们就真结婚  你就能真的能做我的王后了
we'll really marry, and you can be my queen for real.

125
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,330
我想  我对你来说可能太老了
I think that, um, I might be a little too old for you.

126
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,710
我不介意  我很成熟
I don't mind. I'm very grown up.

127
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,980
那好的
Well, that's all right, then.

128
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,390
你孤独吗
Are you lonely?

129
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,790
你  你怎么会这么问
Why... why would you ask that?

130
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,290
你的眼睛今天看起来好哀伤
Your eyes look so sad today.

131
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,040
我有你这样的朋友
How could I be lonely

132
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,360
怎么会觉得孤独呢
when I have a friend like you?

133
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,700
求你
Please.

134
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,430
告诉我为何困我于此
Tell me why I'm here.

135
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,410
当初摩根回来的时候
When Morgan returned here,

136
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,550
她父亲将她拒之门外
when her father rejected her,

137
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,330
你为何不帮她说话
why didn't you speak for her?

138
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,110
你为何不说服他再给她一次机会
Why didn't you convince him to give her another chance?

139
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,910
就是为了这个吗
Is that what this is?

140
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,380
为了当日之事  惩罚我
Punishment... for that day?

141
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,990
我们都要吃自己所种的苦果
We are all the victims of our own actions.

142
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,760
是你自己的抉择让你落到如此地步
It is your own decisions that have brought you here.

143
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,990
如果你愿告解
Perhaps if you were to confess,

144
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,160
也许会找到慰藉
you would find solace.

145
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,530
告解什么
Confess what?

146
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,050
那就要你自己决定了
That is for you to decide.

147
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,470
但不告解是不能得到救赎的
But there can be no salvation without it.

148
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,410
等他们找到我
When they find me,

149
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,980
等我获救
when I'm rescued,

150
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,750
需要哀求宽恕的人就是你了
you will be the one that needs forgiveness.

151
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,340
我的灵魂是没有瑕疵的
My soul is without stain.

152
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,900
是吗
Really?

153
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,330
我们中只有一个
Only one of us

154
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,020
做了婊子  生了杂种
whored herself and sired a bastard.

155
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,960
卫兵  卫兵
Guards! Guards!

156
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,250
卫兵
Guards!

157
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,640
-把她拽开  -我要杀了她
- Get her off me! - I will kill her!

158
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,180
你不会的  别逼我伤害你
No you won't. Don't make me cut you.

159
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,640
你有过机会了  但你不却下不了手
You had your chance, but you couldn't take it.

160
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,060
守在门口  把门锁好
Stay outside the room. Keep the door locked.

161
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,040
别跟她说话
Do not talk to her.

162
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,670
别听她说话  也别迁就她任何要求
Do not listen to her. Do not accede to any of her requests.

163
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,140
她要是再找麻烦
Should she cause further trouble,

164
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,110
你可以酌情使用武力
you may use force, at your discretion.

165
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,470
-有什么问题吗  -没有
- Do you have any questions? - No.

166
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,750
很好
Good.

167
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,030
走吧  薇薇安
Come along, Vivian.

168
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,390
我知道你有疑虑  孩子
I know you have your doubts, child.

169
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,090
但等摩根处理完卡米洛特中心的
But Morgan will return when she has dealt

170
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,020
黑暗势力  她就会回来的
with the darkness at the heart of Camelot.

171
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,160
什么黑暗势力  她在做什么
What darkness? What is she doing?

172
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,580
要有耐心  孩子
Have patience, child.

173
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,300
一切都会按计划实现的
Everything will fall into place.

174
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,430
-这就来了  -我说真的
- Here they come. - I'm telling you,

175
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,870
她真的喜欢我
she really liked me.

176
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,970
-她说她会来看我  -你说谁啊
- She said she'd come and visit! - And who is this?

177
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,340
彭德拉根那晚的一位舞娘
One of the dancers from the other night at Pendragon.

178
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,340
-布拉提斯恋爱了  -我没有
- Brastias is in love. - I'm not in love!

179
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,910
-但是  我们心心相印啊  -可不是么
- But... we had a connection. - Oh, we know.

180
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,770
我们在院子里都听到了
We could hear it out in the courtyard.

181
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,840
谁换个话题
Somebody change the subject.

182
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,580
告诉他们我们刚刚在讨论的事
Tell them what we were discussing.

183
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,420
六个人想会比两个人好
Six minds are better than 2.

184
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,960
是五个人再加上布拉提斯
Well, 5 minds plus Brastias.

185
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,590
-想什么  -想我们努力的方向
- On what? - On what we're working towards.

186
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,890
我们想有所成就  功绩就要永世长存
If we're going to achieve anything, it has to live long after us.

187
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,400
我们不仅要领导人民
It's not enough that we lead.

188
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,980
还要改变人们的观念
We have to change how people think.

189
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,420
-那要怎么做  -要通过人民
- How are we going to do that? - It has to be through the people.

190
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,660
人民不会更迭变化  他们向他们的
They're the constant, what they pass on

191
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,030
孩子传授如何生活的理念
to their children about how to live.

192
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,860
伙计们  我们是来打猎还是来聊天了
Lads, with respect, are we talking, or are we hunting?

193
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,870
记着  一次做一件
Remember, one thing at a time.

194
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,700
布拉提斯的舞娘也这么抱怨来着
That was Brastias's dancer's complaint, as well.

195
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,560
布拉提斯  高文  欧菲尔斯
Brastias, Gawain, Ulfius,

196
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,970
你们走山脊  我们在下面伏着
you take the ridge line. We'll stay down low.

197
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,330
野鸡  野兔  野猪  能找着的都行
Pheasant, hare, boar, whatever you can find.

198
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,070
猎物最多者赢
Greatest number wins.

199
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,290
又发号施令了  里昂提斯
Taking charge again, Leontes?

200
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,380
是团队合作  高文
Working as a unit, Gawain.

201
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,840
你们不会比我们打的多的  你们从没
You're not going to get more than us! You've never managed

202
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,390
比我们打的多过  无意冒犯  殿下
more than us. With respect, Your Highness.

203
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,380
我们日落时再回到这里相见  带着猎物
We'll meet back here at sundown, with our catch.

204
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,470
-胜败自见分晓  -好啊
- We'll see who's better. - Fair enough.

205
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,010
我有了很多的  想法
I had more... thoughts.

206
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,780
很好
I like it.

207
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,460
-嗯  -是啊
- Hm! - Yes.

208
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,620
那么
So,

209
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,750
-你打算怎么做  -你指什么
- what are you going to do? - About what?

210
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,120
摩根
Morgan.

211
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,500
你怎么知道我在想那个
How do you know that's what I'm thinking about?

212
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,940
我可以不去管她的阴谋诡计
I could just leave her to her tricks

213
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,480
就像前几天晚上那样
like the other night.

214
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,810
你怎么知道那是诡计
How do you know it was a trick?

215
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,290
她在玩弄我们  监视我们
She was toying with us, watching us,

216
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,430
看我们如何应对
seeing how we'd react.

217
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,860
她为何要那么做
Why would she do that?

218
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,290
为了王位
The crown.

219
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,090
不管她嘴上怎么说  她仍觊觎着王位
Whatever she says, she still wants it.

220
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,900
她永远不会原谅我们为亚瑟所做一切
She'll never forgive either of us for Arthur.

221
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,420
你是否觉得
Do you think that

222
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,600
你对她可能有点过于执着了
maybe you're getting a little obsessed with her?

223
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,940
甚至...
Or...

224
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,540
...你可能是被她迷上了
...perhaps you're attracted to her?

225
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,550
好吧  被你看穿了
There we go. You've seen right through me.

226
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,220
我迷上她了
I'm besotted with her.

227
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,570
如果是尤瑟就会说  带上人过去
Uther would have said go in there with our men,

228
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,180
把她赶走
have her removed.

229
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,100
或处决掉
Or executed.

230
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,160
基于什么理由呢
On what grounds?

231
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,820
我们不需要理由
Ah, we wouldn't need grounds.

232
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,150
可以弄成意外
Accidents happen.

233
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,770
一有机会就干掉你的敌人
Remove your enemies at the first opportunity.

234
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,990
那是他的处世之道
That was his approach.

235
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,460
也许你比他聪明
Then maybe you're wiser than him.

236
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,110
也许更软弱
Or weaker.

237
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,000
如果她连自己的父亲都可以杀
If she can kill her own father,

238
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,910
就什么都做得出来
she's capable of anything.

239
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,900
我不明白你怎么会做出这种结论
I don't see why that's true.

240
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,000
他是你丈夫
He was your husband.

241
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,840
是啊  但他也有过失
Yes, and I wasn't blind to his faults.

242
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,850
她从修道院回来之时
When she came back from the nunnery,

243
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,800
尤瑟打了她
Uther beat her

244
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,530
就当着我的面
in front of me.

245
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,680
接着羞辱了她
And then he humiliated her.

246
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,620
拒绝了她
Rejected her.

247
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,140
永远拒绝了她
Forever.

248
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,950
所以她才弑父
So, therefore, patricide.

249
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,970
解决家庭纠纷的老套路
The age-old solution to a family dispute.

250
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,380
我可不是那个意思
That's not what I'm saying.

251
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,030
我希望她在这里
I wish she were here.

252
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,010
什么意思
What do you mean?

253
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,230
我希望她可以来看看
I wish she could see

254
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720
并理解我们的所作所为
and understand what we're trying to do.

255
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,230
就像你这样
Like you have.

256
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,030
不过  你比她强多了
But then, you're twice the woman she is.

257
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,860
是吗
Is that right?

258
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,800
不过很遗憾  我想错了
It's a shame, though. I got it wrong.

259
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,350
我以为  她一旦看到...
I thought, once she saw...

260
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,220
...她就会投奔我们
...she'd come to us.

261
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,730
她属于这里
This is where she belongs.

262
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
但她作出了选择
But she made her choices,

263
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,590
错误的选择
and they're the wrong ones.

264
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,270
你带食物来了吗
Did you bring the food?

265
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,940
什么食物
Food?

266
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,660
我们不是准备去给他惊喜吗
Aren't we going to surprise him?

267
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,150
想起来了
Oh! Of course.

268
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,960
我忘了
I forgot.

269
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,340
没关系
Never mind.

270
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,470
我去弄点  稍后再来找你
I'll get it, and then I'll come and find you.

271
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,790
自从做了国王  我很久没打猎了
It's been too long since I've done this.

272
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,440
以前凯和我经常一起狩猎
Kay and I used to do it all the time.

273
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,470
这是我和父亲一起干过的
It's one of the first things

274
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,580
印象最深的事之一
I remember doing with my father.

275
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,300
他以前常带我去抓野猪
He used to take me out hunting for boar.

276
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,230
你抓到过吗
Did you catch it?

277
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,340
他把动物血涂在我身上
He blooded me from the animal.

278
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,700
他告诉我  我成为男人了
He told me I'd now become a man.

279
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,700
当时我才五岁
I was 5 at the time.

280
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,260
他找到窝了
I think he's in place.

281
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,810
两箭全中
Both shots hit the target.

282
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,620
我们合作很默契啊
We make a good team.

283
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,490
很不错
Huh? Not bad.

284
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,440
-太好了  -射得漂亮
- Not bad at all. - Good shot.

285
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,390
谢谢
Thank you.

286
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,580
-这是我的战果  -该你了
- Ah, my kill. - Time for yours.

287
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,510
太棒了
Very nice.

288
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,900
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?

289
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,770
稍等
Just a moment.

290
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,920
你真该看看她的眼睛  欧菲尔斯
You should've seen her eyes, Ulfius.

291
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,750
当时你睡着了  他放弃了
As you slept, and he abstained,

292
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,550
剩下我和女神在云雨
I communed with a goddess.

293
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,840
到底是谁在打猎时唠唠叨叨啊
Now who's talking when they should be hunting?

294
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,000
你批评的对  但她太迷人了
You're right, but she was gorgeous.

295
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,150
里昂提斯为他和亚瑟
Of course, Leontes took the best ground

296
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,470
抢占最好的地盘
for the king and himself.

297
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,440
在这里我们肯定没什么收获
We'll not snare much up here.

298
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,900
如果我们多聆听
Well, maybe if we work more with our ears,

299
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,230
少废话
instead of our mouths,

300
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,160
也许会有更好的机会
we might stand a better chance.

301
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,480
等等  看
Wait. Look!

302
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,470
乖乖
You beauty.

303
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,500
我不明白  出什么事了
I don't understand. Is everything all right?

304
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,710
瑞德雷德  我们得谈一谈
Redwald, we need to talk.

305
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,280
我做错什么了吗
Did I do something wrong?

306
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,790
我知道你没生日
I understand you don't have a birthday.

307
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,270
没有
No.

308
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,260
那不太好
That's not good.

309
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,310
每个人都该有生日
Everyone should have a birthday.

310
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,390
抱歉
I'm sorry.

311
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,700
伊格兰和我讨论了这个问题
Igraine and I have been discussing it,

312
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,200
我们觉得唯一的解决办法就是...
and we feel the only solution is...

313
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,310
...就把今天当作你的生日
...today must be your birthday.

314
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,500
这些...是你的礼物
And these... are your gifts.

315
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,410
现在你正式成为国王的战士了
Now you're officially the king's man.

316
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,460
差点忘了...
Oh, I almost forgot...

317
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,170
真漂亮
They're beautiful.

318
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,640
这是国王
The king,

319
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,520
这是他的勇士  他的母亲
his champion, his mother.

320
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,020
这是你
It's you.

321
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,700
是的
Yes.

322
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,310
给我讲故事吧
Tell me the story.

323
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,220
还要听
Again?

324
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,190
你确定吗
You sure?

325
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,200
这故事很好听
It's a good story.

326
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,440
是很好听
It is a good story.

327
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,470
从前  有个地方
Once, in a land

328
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,880
那里终年阳光明媚
where the sun shone all year,

329
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,770
伫立着一个城堡叫卡米洛特
stood a place called Camelot,

330
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,700
那里有位年轻的国王
where a boy king

331
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,840
还有他高贵的勇士和战士们
and his noble champion and their warriors

332
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,130
他们为了人民的自由而战
fought for the freedom of their people.

333
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,740
在那里
And in that place,

334
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,500
每个孤儿都有庇护之所
every orphan was offered shelter.

335
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,480
有一个男孩叫...  他叫什么来着
And a boy named... What was his name?

336
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,310
瑞德伍德
Redwald!

337
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,390
对  叫瑞德伍德
Yes, Redwald.

338
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,790
他找到了一户人家   长大后成为了
Found a family, and grew up to become

339
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,850
国王最出色  最厉害的战士
the king's finest and most fearsome warrior.

340
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,990
看到吗
You see,

341
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,730
人人都有希望
no one was ever without hope,

342
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,680
无论他们是谁
no matter who they were.

343
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,010
卡米洛特能接纳任何人
Within Camelot was a place for everyone.

344
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,550
我知道你能听见我说话
I know that you can hear me.

345
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,140
他们说过为何要把我关在这里吗
Have they told you why I'm in here?

346
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,200
我当时正要离开城堡
I was leaving the castle,

347
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,740
她们把我劫持到这里
and they abducted me and held me here.

348
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,220
而你却助纣为虐
And now you're helping them.

349
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,710
我是国王的母亲
I am the king's mother!

350
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,050
亚瑟若知道你们如此对我
Do you understand what will happen

351
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,110
定不会轻饶你们
when he finds out what's been done to me?

352
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,790
省省吧
Save your energy.

353
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,960
比比吧
Come on!

354
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,110
你们不可能打这么多
There's no way you shot that!

355
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,690
好像咱们这边赢了
Looks like we're the victors, boys.

356
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,510
才不是呢  你们只是走运而已
No, no, you got lucky, that's all!

357
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,330
陛下  您就继续自欺欺人吧
Keep telling yourself that, Your Highness.

358
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,640
凯  这块给你
Oh, Kay, this is for you.

359
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,940
好的
All right.

360
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,600
好了  我们不能仅限于行军打仗
All right, so we need to be more than warriors.

361
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,160
我们要团结所有村庄
We need to bring every village into the fold,

362
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,140
令他们有权参与政事
somehow give them a say in how they wish to be governed.

363
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,290
您是说仿效罗马的议院制
You're talking about a senate, like the Romans had.

364
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,730
我不知道  应该是吧
I don't know. I suppose.

365
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,600
这样如何  让每个村庄或地区选举一位勇士
What if each village or area sent us a champion--

366
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,300
-派来这里  -作为各方代表
- someone they chose themselves? - To represent their cause.

367
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,380
对  当然他们还是忠诚于你
Yes, but ultimately they'd be loyal to you.

368
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,070
勇士委员会  我喜欢
A council of champions. I like it.

369
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,090
还得比你们三个会打猎才行
So long as they're better hunters than you three.

370
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,410
这家伙还有点脑子
The man has a point.

371
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,190
我不困
I'm not tired.

372
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,540
男孩们
Boys...

373
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,890
都要多休息
...need their sleep.

374
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,550
勇士要有好身体才行
Champions need their strength.

375
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,510
今天是最高兴的一天   谢谢你们
Today was the best day. Thank you.

376
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,260
好好睡
You sleep well.

377
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,520
伊格兰  我爱你
I love you, Igraine.

378
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,670
我知道
Yes.

379
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,130
你很会哄他
You're good with him.

380
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,460
你有孩子吗
Do you have children?

381
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,330
或者以前有过
Or did you? Before?

382
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,220
什么以前
Before what?

383
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,270
来此地以前
Before this.

384
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,000
你可以去任何地方  做任何事
You could be anywhere. Do anything.

385
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,510
为何偏要来这里
Why here?

386
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,170
为何要做这些
Why this?

387
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,660
我浪迹天涯多年  有时想要安顿下来
I ran for a long time. Sometimes you have to stop.

388
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,470
跟没回答一样
That's not even half an answer.

389
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,200
哪里
No.

390
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,180
还不承认  你真是恼人
No. You're infuriating!

391
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,070
-我  -当然
- Me? - Yes.

392
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,730
那就随便问我一个问题
Well, so ask me anything. One question.

393
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,940
我保证知无不言
I promise to answer.

394
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,490
你对我有何看法
What do you think about me?

395
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,010
为何一定要问呢
Why do you always have to ask?

396
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,400
你难道不知道吗
Can't you see?

397
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,850
不知道
No.

398
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,620
我对你了解太少
There's so much about you I don't know.

399
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,470
知道这些很重要吗
And why is knowing so important?

400
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,860
如果不能互相了解
How can we trust each other,

401
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,030
何谈相互信任
if we don't know the truth of who we are?

402
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,510
你真要执着于此吗
Are you that fixed?

403
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,020
你确信你就是真实的自己吗
So certain of who you are?

404
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,150
可能
Maybe.

405
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,560
但你怎知明天不会改变
But how do you know you won't change tomorrow?

406
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,600
我知道会变
Hmm, I'm sure I will.

407
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,980
但我知道自己今晚是谁
But I know who I am tonight.

408
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,060
那么  是谁呢
And who is that?

409
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,800
想和你一夜缠绵的人
Someone who wants you.

410
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,990
你在害怕什么
What are you so scared of?

411
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,570
失控
Losing control.

412
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,080
晚安
Good night.

413
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,920
不
No!

414
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,340
你没事吧
Are you all right?

415
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,620
瑞德伍德...
Oh. Redwald...

416
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,410
-刚才你的脸变了  -不  没有
- Your face changed. - No, no. No...

417
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,640
不  你不舒服
No. You're not well.

418
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,520
瑞德伍德...
Redwald...

419
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,430
你爱我吗
Do you love me?

420
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,770
你是我的护卫吗  那这件事...
Are you my champion? Then this...

421
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,040
是咱们之间的小秘密  明白吗
...has to be our little secret. Do you understand?

422
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,700
可是你不舒服
You're not well.

423
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,590
-我没事   -我去找梅林
- I'm fine! - I'm gonna get Merlin!

424
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,450
不要  不要
No! No!

425
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,410
不
No!

426
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:18,170
不  不
No! No!

427
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,420
为什么不杀了它
Why didn't you kill it?

428
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,400
因为它不仅仅是一只狼
'Cause it was more than a wolf.

429
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,550
-什么意思  -他就是没胆儿而已
- What do you mean? - He means he lost his nerve.

430
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,190
早知如此
Might've known.

431
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,550
欧菲尔斯
Ulfius.

432
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,750
真的离你很近吗
It was close enough to touch?

433
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,850
为何觉得那狼是故意放了你
Why do you think it spared you?

434
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,750
因为它对我另有所图
Because it has another purpose for me.

435
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,160
我发现时已经这样了
I found him like this.

436
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,890
可能这孩子梦游
Maybe he was sleepwalking.

437
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,080
不知不觉绊倒了
Tripped and fell and knew nothing about it.

438
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,540
他的衣服被撕破了
His clothes were torn.

439
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,490
也许是掉下来的时候挂到台子上了
Maybe they ripped on the boards as he fell.

440
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,200
不
No.

441
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,120
肯定有人知道真相
Someone knows what happened.

442
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,630
你没事吧
Are you all right?

443
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,870
没事
Fine.

444
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,940
你如此疼爱他
You cared for him.

445
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,740
我几乎不认识他  何来疼爱
I barely knew him. How could I care for him?

446
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,710
梅林  在我面前  你无需掩饰
Merlin, you don't have to pretend with me.

447
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,630
最有趣的是...
...most amusing...

448
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,340
有人受伤了  快来人
Someone's hurt! Quickly, we need some help!

449
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,910
这种伤天害理的人应该被烧死
Whoever did this deserves to burn.

450
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,470
快来人帮忙  有人受伤了
We need some help here! Someone's hurt!

451
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,210
如果我查出是谁干的
And when I find out who it is,

452
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,820
我会亲自施以火刑
I'll light the pyre myself.

453
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,650
这种禽兽不如的人罪该万死
There's no redemption for a person like this.

454
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,800
那修女走了吗
Has the nun gone?

455
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,850
别跟我说话
Don't speak to me.

456
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,810
你是道纳尔对吗
It is Donal, isn't it?

457
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,080
我记得你父亲曾是这里的铁匠
I remember that your father used to be the blacksmith here.

458
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,860
我们也记得你
And we remember you.

459
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,410
你就是那个目中无人的王后
The stuck-up queen with no time for anyone.

460
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,240
如果真是如此...
Well, if that is true...

461
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,290
我怎会知道你的名字
...how would I know your name?

462
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,160
你觉得摩根知道你的名字吗
Do you think that Morgan knows your name?

463
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,380
道纳尔  求求你
Donal... please.

464
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,640
听我说  片刻就好
Just listen to me, just for a moment.

465
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,780
他们为什么要困住国王的母亲
Why would they lock up the king's mother?

466
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,340
为什么
Why?

467
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,610
你知道这会引起很多麻烦的
You know there'll be trouble about this.

468
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,520
国王会来找我
The king will come for me.

469
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,110
一定会有人救我的  等出去了
I will get out of here, and when I do,

470
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,640
我定会报答你  救救我
there will be a reckoning. Help me.

471
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,930
我发誓会让国王恕你无罪
And I swear I will make sure that the king spares you.

472
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,390
就这么点
That's it?

473
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,600
你就只能答应这点儿
That's all you're offering?

474
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,400
将来可能恕我无罪
Possible future clemency?

475
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,780
道纳尔  告诉我你想要什么
Well, Donal, tell me what you want.

476
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,920
你有什么要求
Tell me what it would take.

477
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,540
尽管说
Name it.

478
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,070
告诉我  我能给你什么
Tell me what I can give you.

479
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,920
可怜的孩子
Poor boy.

480
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,760
自幼便没了母亲  随后...
Brought up without a mother, and then...

481
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,350
父亲又在攻打洛特的时候战死
...loses his father in a battle against Lot.

482
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,170
终于在这里有了家
He found a home here.

483
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,860
对啊  你也是
Yes, just like you.

484
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,200
大家都是如此
Like all of us.

485
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,600
而这也正是亚瑟的志向所在
That's what Arthur's building here.

486
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,130
跟我说实话
Tell me the truth.

487
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,780
你和亚瑟之间到底发生了什么
What happened between you and Arthur?

488
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,930
我不明白你所指何事
I don't know what you're talking about.

489
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,560
就在你婚礼之前  对吗
It was before your wedding day, wasn't it?

490
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,660
伊格兰
Igraine.

491
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,730
那天我看见他和你脸色异常
I saw his face, and yours that day.

492
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,820
肯定有事发生
Something had happened.

493
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,910
你为何现在要问我这些
Why are you asking me this now?

494
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,150
瑞德伍德就这样惨遭毒手
Look at what happened to Redwald.

495
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,890
死亡仿佛阴魂不散
See how death stalks us in life.

496
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,130
所以我们时刻都要
How we must live

497
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,940
随心而活
every moment for what we wish.

498
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,510
我知道
I know what it is

499
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,570
生活在悔恨中的滋味
to live with regret,

500
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,020
数年之后猛然惊醒
to wake up years later,

501
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,390
悔不当初
wishing that I'd done things differently.

502
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,750
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

503
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:27,000
说谎的眼睛  一看便知
I know a liar's eyes when I see them.

504
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,830
我能看出你和亚瑟说话时的眼神
I see the way you talk to Arthur,

505
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,440
你的姿势
the way you stand,

506
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,870
还有你身体里的欲望
the longing in your bodies.

507
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,570
你应该觉得幸运
You're lucky that

508
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,550
里昂提斯已经被爱蒙蔽了双眼
Leontes is too blinded by love to see.

509
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,450
这事折磨得你几近崩溃对吗
It's destroying you, isn't it?

510
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,430
说给我听听
Share it.

511
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,290
那是在我婚礼当天
It was my wedding day.

512
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,350
我也有过犹豫
I had doubts.

513
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,780
但最后还是在一起了
We were together.

514
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,310
-请不要告诉里昂提斯  -当然不会
- Please don't tell Leontes. - Of course not.

515
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,800
你是个善良忠贞的女人
You are a good and faithful woman.

516
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,160
你做出了正确的决定
And you made the right decision.

517
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,070
发誓你会放了我
Swear you'll release me.

518
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,720
得先给甜头才行
Payment first.

519
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,470
现在谁才是你的王
Who's your king now?

520
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,190
亚瑟
Arthur!

521
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,730
你没事吧
Are you all right?

522
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,310
会好的
I will be.

523
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,110
上帝为何要将瑞德伍德从我们身边带走
Why would God want to take Redwald from us?

524
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,290
上帝有时只会静默不语
He doesn't always give answers.

525
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,200
我只能安慰自己
All I can think is

526
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,110
他想将瑞德伍德留在身边
that he wished Redwald to be by his side.

527
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,560
里昂提斯  你是个好人
You are a good man, Leontes.

528
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,350
桂妮薇尔能嫁给你是她的福气
Guinevere is lucky to have you.

529
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,220
你有这样的
A man with a...

530
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,800
大丈夫气度  一定能原谅
...big enough heart to forgive.

531
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,040
原谅什么
What do I have to forgive?

532
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,540
亚瑟和桂妮薇尔
Arthur and Guinevere.

533
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,450
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

534
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,050
对不起
Oh! Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

535
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,560
我以为你知道...
I... I didn't realize that you didn't--

536
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,900
等等  知道...知道什么
No, no, you didn't... you didn't realize what?

537
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,210
不说了不说了  对不起
No, no, please, sorry.

538
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,380
是我让大家难堪了
I've embarrassed us both.

539
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,580
告诉我你什么意思
Tell me what you meant.

540
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,580
我以为他们告诉你了
Well, I thought they told you.

541
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,560
他们在你们结婚那天的事
What happened between them on your wedding day.

542
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,100
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

543
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,750
天啊
Oh, God.

544
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,410
我...很抱歉
Oh, I... I'm so sorry!

545
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,280
-伊格兰  伊格兰  -对不起
- Igraine. Igraine. - I'm sorry.

546
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,660
你怎么来了
What are you doing in here?

547
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,830
我今晚不想独自一人
I don't want to be alone tonight.

548
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,450
可是只要我触到
But when I touch,

549
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,390
任何接触
any contact,

550
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,160
我都能看见
I see...

551
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,560
很多东西
...too much.

552
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,670
我能看见人们的本来面目
I see who people really are.

553
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,220
你什么意思
What do you mean?

554
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,960
他们...
Visions...

555
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,280
过去和未来的幻象
...of their past or future.

556
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,710
他们的所有
Whatever their...

557
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,090
伤痛
...traumas are.

558
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,640
以及秘密
Their secrets.

559
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,870
我不怕
I don't mind.

560
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,360
怎么了
What's the matter?

561
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,320
没什么
Nothing.

562
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,930
因为我没什么见不得人的
Because I have nothing to hide.

563
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,560
早上好
Good morning.
