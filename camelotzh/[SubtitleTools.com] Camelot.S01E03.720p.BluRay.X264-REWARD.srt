区区六个守卫
No more than six guards.

16
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,710
不足挂齿的防御  很好
Paltry defences. It's perfect.

17
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,470
这简直是轻而易举  我们走
Huh! These are easy pickings. Come on!

18
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,150
我说了  我不明白为什么要急着完婚
I just said, I don't understand the rush to get married.

19
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
你俩从小就青梅竹马
You've been sweethearts since you were children.

20
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,810
订婚了五年
Engaged for five years--

21
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,990
我可不觉得这是着急
I don't call that a rush.

22
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,740
布里奇特  如果他不是我的真命天子怎么办
Bridget? What if he isn't the one?

23
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,220
你三天后就要成婚了
You're getting married in three days.

24
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,470
你只是有点动摇而已
You're just having a wobble.

25
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,970
听着  现在好男人不只是稀少
Listen, good men aren't just rare right now;

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,720
他们几乎不存在
they're practically non-existent.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,180
里昂提斯年轻  英俊
Leontes is young, good looking,

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,570
还是国王的护卫  拜托
and the king's champion, for goodness sake!

29
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,710
他是个好的伴侣  会守卫你父亲的土地
He's a good union, and he'll protect your father's land.

30
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,760
而且最重要的是
But most of all,

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,860
他是你母亲一直希望你嫁的郎君
he's the one your mother always wanted for you.

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,170
我已经和里昂提斯说好了
I've told Leontes,

33
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,620
无论我们去哪里
wherever we go,

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,450
我想要你跟我一起
I want you with me.

35
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,290
你不仅是我的表亲
You're not just my cousin;

36
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,770
你还是我最亲密的朋友
you're my closest friend.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,640
-桂妮维尔  -父亲  能不能先敲门啊
- Guinevere! - Father, do you mind?!

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,990
我们得离开这里  我们被袭击了
We must leave here. We're being attacked.

39
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,050
快点  我们得离开
Come on, we must leave.

40
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,090
父亲  阻止他们  不能让他们这么做
Father, stop them! We can't just let them do this!

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,560
没时间争论了
This is no time to argue.

42
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,860
把东西放下
Put those things down!

43
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,950
放下我们的东西  滚蛋
Get out of our things and just go!

44
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,660
桂妮维尔  你斗不过他们的
Guinevere, you can't fight them!

45
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,950
他们人太多了
There's too many of them.

46
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,220
桂妮维尔  快走
Guinevere, now!

47
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,010
我们不能就这么走了
We can't just leave!

48
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,680
滚  否则我就要动手了
Leave before I hurt you!

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,790
我们走
Let's go!

50
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,890
这些人在干什么呢
What are all these people doing here?

51
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,220
他们想要什么
What do they want?

52
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,070
想要新国王的帮助
Favours from the new king.

53
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,500
殿下  能耽误您片刻吗
Your Highness, might I have a moment,

54
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
请允许我...
just to beg your indulgence--

55
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,980
-抱歉  -陛下
- Sorry. - Sire.

56
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,570
殿下  耽误您片刻
Your Highness, just a moment of your time.

57
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,490
兄弟  你弄错了  这才是你要找的人
Wrong brother; it's him you want.

58
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,710
-殿下  -我稍后再来见你
- Oh, Your Highness-- - I'll be with you soon.

59
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,250
或者派其他人来见你  我保证
Or someone will. I promise.

60
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,930
消息已经传出去了  子民蜂拥而来
The word has spread. The people are flocking.

61
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,260
很好
It's good.

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,090
-殿下  -里昂提斯  怎么了
- Your Highness. - Leontes. What's wrong?

63
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,910
怎么回事
What's happened?

64
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,180
强盗袭击了我们  殿下
Bandits attacked us, Your Highness.

65
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,430
他们抢走了一切
They took everything.

66
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,380
我们不能回去了  那里不安全
We can't go back there; it's not safe.

67
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,490
能让他们在此避难吗
Can we give them sanctuary here?

68
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,650
给他们找个房间  我为他们做担保
Find them rooms? I'll vouch for them.

69
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,820
不行  这不是旅馆
No. This isn't a lodge.

70
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,380
没问题
Of course.

71
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,070
你们可以选个自己喜欢的房间
You can choose whatever room you like.

72
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,680
可能不会很舒适  但你们在这里很安全
They won't be comfortable, but you'll be safe here.

73
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,730
谢谢
Thank you.

74
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,760
不过现在无法完婚了
But there will be no wedding now,

75
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,400
此刻正是她最需要你保护的时候
just when she most needed your protection.

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,790
你们要成婚了吗
You're due to be married?

77
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,350
-三天后  -那就在这里举行婚礼吧
- In three days. - Then it must be here.

78
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,750
-什么  不行  -为什么不行
- What? No. - Why not?

79
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,270
-你不想让他们待这里  -我改主意了
- You didn't want them to stay. - Oh, I changed my mind.

80
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,490
没什么比婚礼更让人有希望了
Nothing says hope like a wedding.

81
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,550
国王护卫成婚  这是个完美的象征
The marriage of the king's champion--a perfect symbol.

82
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,900
除非你反对  殿下
Unless you object, Your Highness?

83
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,830
不会  当然不会
No, of course not.

84
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,350
谢谢
Thank you.

85
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,190
你女儿和里昂提斯将在卡米洛特完婚
Your daughter and Leontes shall marry here at Camelot.

86
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,860
您真是位善人
You're very kind.

87
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,870
把锁砸开
Break the lock.

88
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,130
这里就是尤瑟折磨囚犯的地方啊
So this is where Uther tortured his prisoners.

89
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,510
你们曾把囚犯带来这里吗
Did you bring prisoners here?

90
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,750
不仅是囚犯
Not just prisoners;

91
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,780
任何违抗他的人都会被带到这里
anyone who crossed him.

92
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,440
退下
Leave us.

93
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,740
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

94
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,730
薇薇安
Vivian.

95
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,910
过来
Come here.

96
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,430
-你为我父亲效命吗  -是的
- Did you serve my father? - Yes.

97
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,040
这些印记怎么来的
Where did you get these markings?

98
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,040
几百年前  罗马人将我家人带至此地
The Romans brought my family here as slaves,

99
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,960
我们是奴隶
hundreds of years ago.

100
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,830
罗马帝国毁灭时  别人告诉我的
I was told that when the Empire fell,

101
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,400
我们留了下来
we stayed.

102
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,060
这些印记来自我们的祖国
The markings are from our homeland.

103
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,110
告诉我你对尤瑟的看法
Tell me what you thought of Uther.

104
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,040
我敬重你父亲
I respected your father.

105
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,660
你喜欢他吗
Did you like him?

106
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,690
你畏惧他吗
Did you fear him?

107
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,510
我敬重你父亲
I respected your father.

108
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,000
我想要你为我做点事
I want you to do something for me.

109
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,120
去看看所有雇工
Go through the staff.

110
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,950
留下你信任的  赶走你不信任的
Everyone you trust, keep; anyone you don't, get rid of.

111
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,030
好的
All right.

112
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,150
这城堡需要新鲜空气
This castle needs new air.

113
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,000
最好多找些女工来
More women would be good.

114
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,270
不过先把这间屋子清理出来
But first have this room cleared.

115
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,370
那些东西别动
Except for those.

116
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,590
房间现在都是一团糟  不过
The chambers are in a poor state now, but

117
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,440
稍作修葺就行了
it'll just take a little work to improve them.

118
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,110
好了
There.

119
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,730
恕我直言  请问佣人在哪
Forgive me for asking, but where are all the servants?

120
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,980
我们该跟谁交代准备工作呢
Who do we talk to about the preparations?

121
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,430
这个嘛
Oh, well...

122
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,620
其实  没有任何...
...there aren't exactly any...

123
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,160
意思是只有我们
Just us, then?

124
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,010
好吧
Right.

125
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,670
好啊
Good.

126
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,360
好了
Okay.

127
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,060
你正是我们需要的
You are what we need.

128
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,960
卡米洛特的第一个婚礼
The first wedding of Camelot.

129
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,440
我要把你打扮成值得传颂的新娘子
I am going to make you a bride worthy of legend.

130
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,270
-您这么说我会脸红的  -你做得好
- You're going to make me blush. - You've done well.

131
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,300
里昂提斯跟你很般配
Leontes is an excellent match.

132
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,780
我一直这么跟她说来着
That's what I keep telling her.

133
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,410
-他还深得国王宠幸  -我知道
- And he has the king's favour. - I know.

134
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,050
我再也找不到比他更好的人了
I couldn't ask for anyone better.

135
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,240
来  到这来
Here, come.

136
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,420
你爱他吗
Do you love him?

137
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,040
我不确定我是否知道那个字的意思
I'm not sure I even know what that word means.

138
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,870
没关系  我当年也是
That's all right. I was the same.

139
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,360
不过  要知道  只要稍有点运气
But, you know, with a little luck,

140
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,940
假以时日  你就可能会爱上他
in time, you might fall in love with him.

141
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,400
即使没有  在你意识到这点之前
And if you don't, before you know it,

142
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,450
你就会生下他的骨肉  然后你便会
he'll give you children, and then you'll...

143
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,530
你会爱上他们全部
...you'll love them.

144
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,120
很难组建一支国王该有的军队
Hardly an army fit for a king.

145
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,570
与洛特之战  我们损失了不少好士兵
We lost a lot of good men during the fight with Lot.

146
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,590
迟早还会有人来参军的
Sooner or later others are going to come.

147
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
不过现在我们不堪一击
But right now we're vulnerable.

148
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,820
如果能征招到一位有经验战士
If we recruit an exceptional warrior,

149
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,200
就能鼓舞士气  也能整顿一下军风
it would boost our morale, shake things up a bit.

150
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,590
再来点运气  大家就都会闻风而至
Then with a bit of luck, everyone will hear about it and come.

151
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,230
你想到什么人选了吗
Anyone spring to mind?

152
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,340
也许有一个
Maybe.

153
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,480
高文  一位战士  我曾与之作战
Gawain, a warrior I fought against once.

154
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,030
我曾试着招他入伍  为尤瑟而战
I tried to recruit him to Uther's men,

155
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,980
但他拒绝了
but he refused.

156
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,180
那你凭什么觉得我们这次能说服他呢
What makes you think we get him this time?

157
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,470
时代变了  你不是一直这么跟我说吗
This is different. Isn't that what you keep telling me?

158
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,960
反正问一下也不会有何损失
No harm in asking.

159
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,710
有事吗
Can I help you?

160
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,140
我来此只为见国王
I'm here for the king only.

161
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,800
他姐姐命我带信给他
His sister sends a message.

162
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,780
你的姐姐  也是你的同盟
Your sister and ally

163
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,110
邀请你去你父亲的城堡
invites you to visit your father's castle.

164
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,990
她为你准备了盛宴
She's planning a feast in your honour.

165
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,710
如此盛情啊
Such hospitality.

166
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,200
所为哪般呢
Why?

167
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,850
我只是代为转述而已
I only relay what I am told.

168
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,570
我们接受邀请
Then we accept.

169
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,800
我们即刻就会启程
We'll ride out immediately.

170
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,590
她会很高兴的
She'll be delighted.

171
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,310
未跟我商榷之前  不要私自接受任何邀请
You don't accept anything without conferring with me.

172
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,800
我是国王
I'm the king

173
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,830
我意已决
and I made a decision.

174
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,150
我觉得这里还有很多工作要做
I think there's quite enough to be doing here.

175
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,700
比如主持婚礼吗
Like hosting a wedding?

176
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,700
摩根是我姐姐  我想要多了解她
Morgan's my sister. I want to get to know her better.

177
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,370
如果我连自己的家人都无法团结
If I can't unite my own family,

178
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,570
又怎么去统一这个国家
how am I going to unite the country?

179
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,780
我们在哪能找到这位战士
So, where do we find this warrior?

180
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,530
最后一次听到他的消息时
The last I heard of him,

181
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,050
他就住在离这里一日骑程的地方
he was a day's ride from here.

182
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,830
我注意到你看她时的表情了
I see the way you look at her,

183
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,560
那个桂妮维尔
Guinevere.

184
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,880
里昂提斯的桂妮维尔吗
Leontes' Guinevere?

185
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,460
你梦到过她
You dreamt of her.

186
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,970
-没有  -别对我撒谎
- No I didn't. - Don't lie to me.

187
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,950
你们以前见过吗
Have you met her before today?

188
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,580
加冕礼那天见过一次  仅此而已
At the coronation, that's all.

189
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,470
没在别的地方见过了
Nowhere else?

190
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,320
没有
No.

191
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,780
没在沙滩上见过吗
Not on a beach?

192
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,910
你为什么会觉得我在沙滩上见过她
Why do you think I met her on a beach?

193
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,500
因为我看到了
Because I saw it.

194
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,340
只是个梦  我梦到了她  没别的了
It was a dream. I had a dream of her; nothing else.

195
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,800
那就好  因为她是属于里昂提斯的
Good, because she belongs to Leontes.

196
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,640
没有谁是属于谁的
Nobody belongs to anyone.

197
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,500
不能让任何东西威胁到我们的大业
And nothing jeopardizes our work here,

198
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,210
尤其是女人
least of all a woman.

199
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,390
你觉得你有权利这么跟我说话吗
Do you think you have the right to talk to me like that?

200
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,390
你现在的一切成就
Everything you are right now

201
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,810
都归功于我
is because of me.

202
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,780
记住了
Remember that.

203
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,460
殿下驾临  倍感荣幸
Your Highness. I'm honoured.

204
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,220
谢谢
Thank you.

205
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,480
你做了些改动啊
You have made changes.

206
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,300
是的  这里需要女人的打理
Yes, it needed a woman's touch.

207
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,150
来吧  我想你晚饭前一定想放松一下
Come on. I'm sure you'd like to relax before dinner.

208
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,020
薇薇安会照顾你  带你去你的寝宫
Vivian will look after you and show you to your chambers.

209
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,370
梅林
Merlin,

210
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,440
你随我来
you're with me.

211
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,850
我很高兴你们接受了邀请
I'm so glad you accepted my invitation.

212
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,220
我没接受  是亚瑟
I didn't; Arthur did.

213
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,180
你不能让那男孩离开你的视线
You can't let the boy out of your sight.

214
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,640
保护他是我的职责
It's my job to protect him.

215
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,600
-我只是想了解他  -王位现在是他的了
- I simply want to know him. - The crown is his now.

216
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,800
我了解
I understand that.

217
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,250
那么你完全放弃对王位的争夺了吗
So you've abandoned your claim entirely.

218
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,330
我们到了
Here you are.

219
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,290
你的旧房间
Your old room.

220
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,060
当年你伺奉尤瑟时  就住在这里
From when you were Uther's lackey.

221
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,450
真令人印象深刻
Impressive.

222
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,000
我们怎么就没这样的膳食呢
And why don't we have meals like this?

223
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,780
谢谢你  薇薇安
Thank you, Vivian.

224
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,500
就算我想毒死你
If I wanted to poison you,

225
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,140
也不会浪费如此美味的鹌鹑汤
I wouldn't do it by wasting good quail soup.

226
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,120
亚瑟
So Arthur,

227
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,810
如今你已拥有了王位
now that you have the crown,

228
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,300
你会用它做什么呢
what will you do with it?

229
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,670
问得好
That's a good question.

230
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,950
那就用妙语作答让我折服吧
Then dazzle me with a good answer.

231
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,320
作为一个男人和一位国王的首要职责
"The first duty of a man and of a king

232
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,120
便是追寻和探索真理
is the seeking after and investigation of truth."

233
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,740
西塞罗说的
Cicero.

234
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,740
西塞罗-罗马最杰出的演说家  教育家

235
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,140
完全正确
That's right.

236
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,760
他真是个好学生
He's been a good student.

237
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,970
但你要怎样将这理论付诸于实践呢
But how do you apply that principle in practice?

238
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,330
在做决策之前
Before I make too many decisions,

239
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,120
我必须先了解我的王国
I must get to know my kingdom

240
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,560
了解我的子民
get to know its people.

241
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,350
他们也必须了解你
And they must get to know you.

242
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,270
我不知道你来了
I didn't know you were there.

243
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,460
刚才的宴会相当丰盛
That was quite a feast you gave us.

244
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,250
我只想和你待一会儿
I just wanted to spend some time with you.

245
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,370
我吃了很多
I've had a lot to eat

246
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,690
也喝多了
and drink.

247
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,070
别指望我会清醒很久
Can't promise I'll be awake for that long.

248
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,220
男人都那样
Men seldom are.

249
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,260
这是我们的父亲以前就寝的房间吗
Is this the room our father used to sleep in?

250
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,890
是的  和我母亲一起
Yes, with my mother.

251
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,790
那时我还很小
When I was very little.

252
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,850
跟我说说他的事
Tell me about him.

253
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,250
他...
He...

254
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,260
他是个伟大的战士
He was a great warrior.

255
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,010
他可以很和蔼
He could be kind.

256
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,640
但也可以很残忍
But he could also be cruel...

257
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,830
极其残忍
extremely cruel.

258
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,030
我知道我的出现让你很为难
I know my arrival was difficult for you.

259
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,420
但我很高兴
But I'm glad

260
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,160
我们今晚有了良好的开端...
we got to start again tonight...

261
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,880
很高兴我们能适当地进行相互了解
glad we could get to know each other properly.

262
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,500
是啊
Yes.

263
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,910
只是我...我并不了解你  亚瑟
It's just that I... I don't really know you, Arthur.

264
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,230
你是谁
Who are you?

265
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,330
我真的说不出来
I can't really tell.

266
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,370
随便问我点问题
Ask me anything.

267
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,590
有人告诉过你  你是个王子吗
Were you ever told you were the son of a king?

268
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,140
没有
No.

269
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,190
真的
Honestly.

270
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,580
我们的父亲去世后  梅林告诉我了一切
Until Merlin arrived just after our father's death,

271
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,960
之前我什么都不知道
I knew nothing.

272
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,080
你什么都不知道吗
You knew nothing?

273
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,650
是的
Yes.

274
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,650
那现在呢  你有什么期望
And now? What do you hope for?

275
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,860
那是什么
What's in there?

276
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,420
很抱歉  我弄伤你了吗
I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?

277
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,360
没有
No.

278
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,940
没事
No, it's fine.

279
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,270
如果你不介意的话  我现在要睡了
Now, if you don't mind, i'd quite like to pass out.

280
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,850
当然
Of course.

281
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,470
晚安
Sleep well,

282
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,170
殿下
Your Highness.

283
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,750
叫我亚瑟就行了
Just Arthur.

284
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,190
好吧
Yes.

285
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,360
就叫你亚瑟
Just Arthur.

286
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,260
你那无畏的战士
So your fearless warrior

287
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,480
就住在这烂教堂里
lives in this burnt-out church.

288
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,000
是这地方  没错
This is the place; has to be.

289
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,630
你确定吗
And you're certain?

290
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,580
我们去看看  走吧
Let's find out. Come on.

291
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,910
有人吗
Hello?

292
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,400
你的国王需要你的服务
Your king requires your service.

293
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,910
我不认识什么国王
I don't recognize any king.

294
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,430
好吧  但他认识你
Well, he recognizes you.

295
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,960
并且他需要你效忠
And he demands your loyalty.

296
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,390
是你
You.

297
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,180
我告诉过你了
I've told you before,

298
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,360
我没兴趣效忠尤瑟
I'm not interested in serving Uther.

299
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,260
你说过他很棒
I thought you said he was good.

300
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,360
好像也不咋样
He's not that good.

301
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,110
卡米洛特有很多他这样的男人
Camelot's got plenty of men as good as him.

302
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,110
谁是卡米洛特
Who's Camelot?

303
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,400
那不是一个人  是个地方
It's not a who; it's a place.

304
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,550
那里是我的兄弟  亚瑟王  统治的国家
From where my brother, King Arthur, rules the country.

305
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,770
不是我瞧不起他  他不是国王
Not my bit, he doesn't.

306
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,640
你对他没有任何了解
You don't know anything about him.

307
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,170
不过你固步自封于此  不了解也不奇怪
Hardly surprising, if you shut yourself away here.

308
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,420
那他就是另一个自以为是国王的军阀
So he's another warlord who thinks he's a king.

309
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,380
我没兴趣
I'm not interested.

310
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,680
他是尤瑟亲生的
He's from Uther's bloodline.

311
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,110
那没什么值得骄傲的
That's nothing to be proud of.

312
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,160
他从瀑布中拔出了战神之剑
He pulled the sword of Mars from the waterfall.

313
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,910
你要我怎么做  欢呼吗
What do you want me to do? Cheer?

314
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,880
他打败了洛特王
He vanquished King Lot.

315
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,140
洛特死了吗
Lot's dead?

316
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,380
你们想找我做什么
So what do you want with me?

317
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,890
我们需要一名强大的战士
We need a strong warrior to return with us,

318
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,960
帮我们训练其他人
help train others.

319
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,720
我们专程从海边过来寻访你的
We came from the coast to look for you.

320
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,710
你们是在浪费时间
Then you wasted your time.

321
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,640
我看也是
Obviously.

322
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,520
看来今晚得睡在这里了
We're going to have to sleep here.

323
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,110
给钱才能睡
Not unless you pay me.

324
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,550
你到底怎么了
This is what's happened to you?

325
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,680
从一个倍受尊崇的战士
From a respected warrior to

326
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,890
沦落到催讨房租的吝啬鬼
demanding payment for lodging.

327
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,740
这太令人震惊了
It's impressive.

328
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,320
再也没什么值得为之而战了
There's nothing worth fighting for anymore.

329
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,690
哪里能赚钱我就去哪里
I take money where I can get it.

330
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,650
这是主的居所
This is the Lord's dwelling.

331
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,750
这代表我有权住这里
And this grants me access.

332
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,650
好吧
Fine.

333
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,880
但天一亮  你们就得离开
But come first light, you leave.

334
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,510
你叫什么名字
What is your name?

335
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,810
桂妮维尔
It's Guinevere.

336
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,360
那次杀戮  他倍感骄傲
He was so proud at that kill.

337
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,500
那只雄鹿垂死挣扎了很久
The stag refused to die for a long time.

338
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,400
尤瑟喜爱战斗
Uther loved to fight.

339
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,920
我记得
I remember.

340
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,440
那只受伤的鹿跳得最高
The wounded deer jumps highest,

341
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,320
抗争最顽强
strives the hardest.

342
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,770
我不是只受伤的鹿  梅林
I'm not a wounded deer, Merlin.

343
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,640
我也不是国王的战利品
And I'm not a king's trophy.

344
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,220
很好  让我们为此喝一杯
Good. Let's drink to that.

345
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,780
你还记得年幼时的我吗
Do you remember me as a child?

346
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,360
不记得
No.

347
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,670
可我记得你
I remember you.

348
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,570
有一次父王染病
You came once when my father was ill.

349
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,840
幸得你妙手回春
You cured him.

350
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,140
我治愈的人数不胜数
I've cured many.

351
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,820
我还因此仰慕于你
I adored you for that.

352
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,880
我跟父王说  长大之后要下嫁给你
I told him that when I grew up, I'd marry you.

353
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,850
-你可知父王当时说什么  -不知道
- And do you know what he said? - No.

354
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,120
他说  得梅林者得天下
He said, "Marry Merlin and everything will be yours.

355
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,200
但你会为他迷失心智
Except your soul".

356
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,820
言重了
A little harsh.

357
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,700
梅林  我能闻到你的气息
I can smell you, Merlin.

358
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,440
是你杀了尤瑟  我早该想到
It was you. I should've known.

359
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,290
酒里有毒  酒里有毒
The wine. The wine!

360
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,810
亚瑟  你不能进来
Arthur... You can't be in here.

361
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,010
别这样
Don't do this.

362
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,370
我必须来见你
I have to see you.

363
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,290
我要跟你谈谈
I have to talk to you.

364
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,380
我不能这么做
I can't.

365
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,990
告诉我 你不曾想念过我
Tell me you're not thinking of me,

366
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,220
那我马上离开
and I'll leave you alone.

367
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,090
我在海滩等你
Meet me at the beach.

368
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,540
-我不知能否赶到  -我会等你
- I don't know if I can. - I'll wait for you.

369
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,180
-如果我去不了...  -我会等你
- If I'm not there-- - I'll wait for you.

370
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,720
放开我
Get off me!

371
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,600
亚瑟在哪里
Where's Arthur?

372
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,680
亚瑟
Arthur!!

373
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,320
放开我
Let me go.

374
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,140
你每次醒来都这般狂躁吗
Do you always wake in such a bad mood?

375
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,650
-你拿了什么  -一些脚趾甲而已
- What are you taking? - Just a few toenails.

376
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,750
我还为你修剪了胡须
And I trimmed your beard.

377
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,000
看你一副蓬头垢面的模样
You were looking dishevelled.

378
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,570
-亚瑟呢  -走了
- Where's Arthur? - Gone.

379
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,750
-他昨夜就走了  -你抓我做什么
- He left in the night. - Why are you holding me?

380
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,870
我是在为我弟弟着想  你可能心怀不轨
I'm worried for my brother. You may be dangerous.

381
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,830
我心怀不轨
I'm dangerous?

382
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,570
我看到了你对尤瑟的所作所为
I saw what you did to Uther.

383
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,680
你居然杀死了自己的父亲
You murdered your own father.

384
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,670
父亲
Father!

385
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,680
他根本不配被称为父亲
He never deserved to be called a father.

386
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,370
父亲对女儿绝不会像尤瑟对我这样
Fathers don't do to their daughters what Uther did to me.

387
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,500
他到底对你做了什么  摩根
Ooh! What did he do to you, Morgan?

388
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,910
他使我变得强大  这点我倒心存感激
He made me strong. And for that I'm grateful.

389
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,270
你能做的...
What you can do--

390
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,470
你学到的那种能量
this power you've learned--

391
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,260
不会使你变得强大
that doesn't make you strong;

392
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,960
只会令你元气大伤  代价斐然
it hurts you; it costs.

393
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,070
梅林  你别想吓唬我
Don't try and frighten me, Merlin!

394
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,420
这是真的
It's true.

395
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,630
你此刻恐已受控于它
You're in its grip even now.

396
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,990
你可能还未意识到
Oh, you don't realize it,

397
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,190
其实你已极其脆弱
but you've never been more vulnerable in your life.

398
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,900
可现在被锁住的人不是我
I'm not the one tied up here, am I?

399
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,320
-你以为我逃不走吗  -那就让我见识一下
- You think I can't free myself? - Then do it.

400
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,350
不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no, no.

401
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,650
-我不屑耍雕虫小技  -因为你做不到
-I don't perform tricks. - Because you can't.

402
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,440
因为我足够强大  大可不必这么做
Because I'm strong enough to choose not to.

403
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,250
做了才能显示你更强大
It would be stronger to choose to do it.

404
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,520
随心所欲  这就是你所谓的本事
To do it at will? Is that what you can do?

405
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,360
-当然  -见识一下
- Yes. - Show me.

406
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,280
让我见识一下你的本事
Show me what you can do.

407
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,010
是你
That's you.

408
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,780
这就是年幼的你
That's you as a child.

409
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,710
够了
Enough!

410
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,580
你的代价太大了
The price will be too high.

411
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,490
不  这点算不得什么
No. Not too high at all.

412
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,990
放我走
Let me go.

413
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,990
放开我
Untie me.

414
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,270
摩根
Morgan.

415
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,120
摩根
Morgan.

416
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,530
摩根
Morgan!!

417
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,440
-别嫁给他  -别胡说
- Don't marry him. - Don't be ridiculous.

418
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,720
-你们不配  -你根本不了解我
- He's not right for you. - You don't even know me.

419
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,820
我们之间有种难言的情愫
There was something between us.

420
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,880
在加冕礼上
At the coronation.

421
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,780
还有这里
And here,

422
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,660
每次我们相遇之时
when we met.

423
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,480
我没感觉到
I didn't feel it.

424
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,480
别再否认了
Stop denying it.

425
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,830
你想让我说什么
What do you want me to say?

426
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,290
承认我们之间也许会有些什么
That there could be something between us.

427
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,600
-我就要嫁人了  -不要
- I'm getting married. - Don't.

428
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,730
你是以国王的身份命令我吗
Are you asking me as my king?

429
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,410
还是个仅仅相遇过两次
Or as a complete stranger who's only met me twice

430
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,480
却自以为能左右我的陌生人
who has decided that he can order me about?

431
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,440
你若不是深有同感  为何要来这里
If you don't feel the same way, then why did you come?

432
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,070
我来让你打消念头
To ask you to stop.

433
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,730
在卡米洛特时你为何不说
You could've said that at Camelot.

434
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,890
你来
You came...

435
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,040
...是因为你也盼着这一刻
...because you wanted this too.

436
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,690
不
No.

437
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,720
或许
Maybe.

438
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,380
再吻
Again.

439
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,480
不要
Stop.

440
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,950
他会知道的
He'll know.

441
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,230
你怎么哭了
Why are you crying?

442
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,280
因为我盼着这一刻
Because I want this.

443
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,230
仅此一次
Just once,

444
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,470
仅此一次
just once,

445
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,110
一次
just once,

446
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,680
就一次...
just once...

447
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,600
别碰我的东西
You get away from that stuff.

448
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,320
马可·奥里利乌斯
Marcus Aurelius.

449
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,320
马可·奥里利乌斯
西方哲学家 罗马皇帝

450
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,920
你读过
You've read it?

451
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,540
伟大的哲学帝王之一
One of the great philosopher kings.

452
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,570
我...
I'm, uh...

453
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,800
-我有些地方看不懂  -哪里不懂
- struggling a little. - Where are you up to?

454
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,460
从父亲的声望和对他的追忆中
"From the reputation and remembrance of my father,

455
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,860
我学到了谦恭勇武
"I learnt modesty and a manly character.

456
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:19,350
从兄长西弗勒斯那里  我学会了疼爱亲人
"And from my brother Severus, I learnt to love my kin,

457
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,220
热爱真理与正义
and to love truth and justice."

458
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,040
你很棒
You're very good.

459
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,750
谁教你的
Who taught you?

460
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,700
我父亲
My father.

461
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,790
你呢
What about you?

462
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,660
自学
Teaching myself.

463
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,710
这可不简单啊
That's quite a task.

464
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,400
为什么想学
So why bother?

465
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,460
想有所提高
To be better.

466
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,360
你说的没错
You were right about him.

467
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,170
他的确是完美的人选
He'd be perfect.

468
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,960
要是他自己知道就好了
If only he knew it.

469
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,760
如果我去
If I did come,

470
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,520
有一个条件
one condition:

471
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,670
教我读这本书
teach me how to read this book.

472
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,070
等我们完成卡米洛特的大业时
By the time we're finished at Camelot,

473
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,620
你就能写书了
you'll be ready to write a book.

474
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,260
结束了
It's over.

475
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,090
就这样吧
This was it--

476
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,590
只此一次
the once.

477
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,190
从此我们必须缄口不言
Now we must never talk of it.

478
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,400
永远不能让他知道
He must never know.

479
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,170
我得去准备我的婚礼了
I have to get ready for my wedding.

480
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,360
很好  这里放一个  那边也放一个
Oh, good, yes. Put one here and just put one there.

481
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,070
-你俩换一下  -好的  夫人
- Oh, I need you to switch. - Yes, madam.

482
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,860
再高些
Higher!

483
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,360
再拿高一点
Bring it up a bit more.

484
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,250
把这个吊上去
You're going to put that up?

485
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,550
好的  再高点
Oh, yes, higher.

486
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,110
再高一点点  好了  就这样
And a little bit higher. Okay, stop.

487
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,730
他会知道的
He'll know.

488
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,600
今晚  里昂提斯就会知道的
Tonight, Leontes will know.

489
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,950
我们该怎么办
What are we going to do?

490
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,800
我们得想办法解决  里昂提斯是个好人
We have to fix this. Leontes is a good man.

491
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,220
我知道
I know.

492
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,460
天哪
Oh, my God.

493
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,490
把匕首给我
Give me the knife.

494
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,200
-它已经死了  -我们有办法了
- It's already dead. - We can make it right.

495
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,400
-把酒袋给我  -你要做什么
- Get me the wine sack. - What are you going to do?

496
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,970
我们该回去了
We have to get back.

497
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,790
这就走了吗
You're leaving?

498
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,510
你展示给我看的  是你全部的本事吗
What you showed me is that all you've learnt?

499
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,010
目前是的
For now.

500
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,840
你不懂你所滥用的法术
You don't understand the forces you're messing with.

501
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,590
但我懂  你不会如愿的
I do. You won't get what you want.

502
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,290
我们只需耐心地拭目以待  不是吗
We'll just have to wait and see, won't we?

503
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,890
我学会了耐心
I've learned to be patient.

504
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,010
告诉国王  这里永远是他的家
Tell the king he has a home here, always.

505
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,120
摩根  摩根
Morgan? Morgan.

506
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,280
愿你尽快恢复健康和理智
May your health and judgment return promptly.

507
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,700
开门
Open the gates!

508
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,330
最后的自由之夜  里昂提斯
Last night of freedom, Leontes!

509
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,310
你很快就是有妇之夫了
You'll soon be a married man!

510
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,720
别别别  放我下来
No! Put me down! No!

511
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,460
我是高文
Gawain.

512
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,510
亚瑟
Arthur.

513
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,830
显然  我现在替你卖命
Apparently I work for you now.

514
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,850
走咯
Here we go, son!

515
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,940
信使送来了这个  没说是谁送的
Messenger brought this. Didn't say who it was from.

516
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,420
-想现在打开吗  -当然
- Do you want to open it now? - Yes.

517
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,210
真美
Oh, that is so beautiful.

518
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,680
我们该配上丝带  这样你就能戴了
We should put it on a ribbon so that you can wear it.

519
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,250
-祝您健康  陛下  -殿下
- Your health, Sire. - Your Highness.

520
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,990
殿下
Your Highness.

521
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,050
亚瑟  殿下
Arthur, Your Highness,

522
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,950
我有一事相求
there's something I wanted to ask you.

523
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,710
您愿意为我们主持婚礼吗
Would you preside over our ceremony?

524
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,610
我本来请了村里的长者来主持
I've arranged to have an elder from our village do it,

525
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,340
但若能由国王主持  那将更有意义
but it would mean so much more if the king would honour it.

526
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,790
当然
Of course.

527
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,820
谢谢
Thank you.

528
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:56,780
若风暴席卷我们的土地
*And if the storm blows through our land *

529
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,920
我愿做你的避风港
*I'll be your shelter *

530
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:06,210
我愿做你的避风港
*I'll be your shelter *

531
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:11,440
可否做我的灯塔
*If you'll be my light *

532
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:17,300
可否做我的灯塔
*If you'll be my light *

533
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:28,120
当凛冬将至
*And if the world should fall to winter *

534
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,850
我将成为你的妻
*I'll be your wife *

535
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,280
我将成为你的妻
*I'll be your wife *

536
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:42,790
可否做我的灯塔
*If you'll be my light *

537
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,220
里昂提斯真走运
Lucky Leontes.

538
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:58,820
当乌云漫天
*And if the skies should cloud to darkness *

539
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,350
我愿做你的阳光
*I'll be your sun *

540
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,270
我愿做你的阳光
*I'll be your sun *

541
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,120
咱们来瞧瞧你内心的真实所想  弟弟
Let's see what's truly in your heart, brother.

542
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,820
愿此婚戒
May these rings stand forever

543
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,170
成为你们结合与忠诚的
as a symbol of your unity

544
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,780
永恒象征
and fidelity.

545
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,000
愿你们白头偕老
May you live and grow old together,

546
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,110
发现永恒的
knowing only the truth

547
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,930
爱的真理
of undying love.

548
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,170
在众人的见证之下
By witness of all of those present...

549
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,760
我宣布你们
...I confirm you...

550
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,150
成为夫妻
...as man and wife.

551
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:39,520
里昂提斯  桂妮维尔  恭喜
Leontes and Guinevere! Leontes and Guinevere!

552
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,660
