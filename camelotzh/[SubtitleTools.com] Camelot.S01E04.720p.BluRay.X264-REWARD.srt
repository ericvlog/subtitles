传我旨意  叫所有战士起床

19
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,980
命高文开始训练他们
Tell Gawain he starts training everyone.

20
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,320
即刻就去
Right away.

21
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,620
遵命
Of course.

22
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,730
早上好  夫人
Good morning... wife.

23
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,860
早上好  夫君
Morning, husband.

24
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,200
-你在偷看我的睡相吗  -是
- Were you watching me sleep? - Yes.

25
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,410
-你真是少见多怪  -我很幸运
- You are so strange. - I'm lucky.

26
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,770
我是唯一能窥见你这副模样的人
I'm the only man who ever gets to see you like this.

27
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,000
你是个好人
You're a good man.

28
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,430
那么
So...

29
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,590
我们何时能离开卡米洛特
So when can we leave Camelot?

30
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,220
恐怕没那么简单
I don't think it's going to be that simple.

31
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,830
里昂提斯
Leontes,

32
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,830
你答应过我婚礼之后就去请示国王
you promised after the wedding you would talk to the king

33
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,850
封我们一些土地  让我们生活在一起
about getting some land and a place for us to live together.

34
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,260
是  我知道  但是
Yes, I know, but...

35
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,270
里昂提斯  别枕边厮磨啦
Leontes, put her down!

36
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,890
国王要召集所有战士
The king wants all his warriors now!

37
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,160
我明白
I understand.

38
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,450
我们迟早会离开的
And in time we will.

39
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,760
但现在国王需要他的护卫
But right now the king needs his champion...

40
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,620
伴其左右
here.

41
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,180
你能理解的  对吗
You understand that, don't you?

42
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,490
早餐
Breakfast.

43
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,170
为何不下楼跟他一起用餐
Why don't you go down, eat with him?

44
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,800
我在等他邀请我
I'm waiting to be invited.

45
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,340
也许有必要小小的引导一下
Perhaps a little guidance is needed.

46
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,850
你可否传书到卡米洛特说我们要去
Did you send word to Camelot to expect us?

47
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,040
都按您吩咐的办了  这是彩礼
Both done as you asked. And this is the gift.

48
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,160
彩礼
The gift!

49
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,750
送新娘再合适不过了
Perfect for a new bride.

50
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,210
很好  很好
Very good. Very good.

51
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,820
恕我冒昧  我们为何要如此在意
If you don't mind me asking, why are we paying such attention

52
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,840
一名国王护卫的妻子
to the bride of the king's champion?

53
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,330
作为国王的姐姐
As the king's sister,

54
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,560
我理应欢迎所有卡米洛特的新到之客
I should welcome every new arrival into Camelot.

55
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,790
尤其是女人们  我们能赋予彼此力量
Especially the women. We can give each other strength and...

56
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,140
您还好吗
Are you all right?

57
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,720
我没事
I'm fine.

58
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,920
让我帮你吧
Let me help.

59
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,670
我说了我没事
I said I'm fine.

60
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,180
行了
Now,

61
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,400
我的马到底备好了没有
is my horse ready or not?

62
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,510
您昨天就抱痛不已
You were complaining of pains yesterday.

63
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,180
您确定可以骑马吗
Are you sure you're well enough to ride?

64
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,460
你是医生还是仆人
Are you a doctor, or a servant?

65
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,060
我这就去把一切准备停当
I'll ensure everything's ready.

66
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,490
都在这儿了
This is it?

67
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,790
没错
Yes.

68
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,880
我还以为会是一支军队
I thought there'd be an army.

69
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,930
国王的势力才区区如此  当真吗
The king's forces are this few? Really?

70
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,590
我们正在招兵买马
We're recruiting.

71
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,400
那我们为何而战
So what are we fighting for?

72
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,780
此话怎讲
How do you mean?

73
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,600
我们作战的模式  我训练你们的方式
The way we fight, the way I train you all,

74
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,630
都要根据作战目的而定
depends on what we're fighting for.

75
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,810
-我们为自由而战  -谁的自由
- We're fighting for freedom. - Whose?

76
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,580
-全民的  -但不是我的
- Everyone's. - Not mine.

77
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,240
我已是自由之身  可以为所欲为
I'm free already. I can do what I want.

78
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,060
那你为何来此
Well, then why are you here?

79
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,020
他们告诉我你值得效忠
They told me you were worth following.

80
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,360
那我们就为人民而战
Then we're fighting for the people,

81
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,900
为了他们能在乱世中求得自由
for their freedom from chaos.

82
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,120
给他一个机会
Give him a chance.

83
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,300
好吧
All right.

84
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,210
不多说了  让我见识见识你的身手
Forget the talk. Show me how you fight.

85
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,180
也许能为你加一些印象分
Maybe I can make them in your image.

86
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,380
我准备好了
I'm ready.

87
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,680
我不确定你是否准备好了  殿下
I'm not sure you are ready, Your Highness.

88
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,890
行了
All right.

89
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,210
斯巴达  完美的训练场
Sparta. The perfect training ground.

90
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,210
斯巴达 希腊南部的古代城邦

91
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,670
那些混蛋还是有一技之长的
Those bastards were good for something.

92
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,010
好吧  那你就是我们的训练人了
Well, then you are the man to train us.

93
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,510
很高兴你同意了
I'm glad that you agree.

94
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,070
看来你需要一把新剑了
Looks like you need a new sword.

95
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,160
是啊  一把适合国王佩戴的剑
Yes, one suitable for a king.

96
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,990
你知道卡利伯恩吗
Do you know Caliburn?

97
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,100
Caliburn是传中的石中剑
此处为铸剑师的名字

98
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,100
是我见过最棒的刀匠
Best bladesmith I ever met.

99
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,250
他会为你打造一把独一无二的剑
He'll make you something special.

100
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,290
我在哪儿能找到他
Where will I find him?

101
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,150
自他妻子死后  他一直隐居山林中
He's been holed up in the woods since his wife died.

102
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,970
你得多加小心  此人反复无常
You'll need to be careful; He's volatile.

103
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,320
我不介意反复无常
I don't mind volatile.

104
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,830
只要你给我指明方向  我就能找到他
You give me directions, I'll find him.

105
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,210
走之前  我要跟你谈谈
Before I do, a word.

106
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,480
就此打住  不管你对她有什么感情
It stops now. Whatever you feel for her,

107
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,930
立刻一刀两断  你们没有未来
destroy it. It has no future.

108
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,530
-你不能掌控我的未来  -最后通牒
- You don't control my future. - Last warning.

109
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,190
不要让错误的欲望搅乱我们的计划
Don't unsettle our project with misdirected desire.

110
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,650
刻苦训练  我会带着剑回来的
Train hard. I'll return with a sword.

111
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,060
我相信你的新婚之夜一定很称心如意吧
I trust your wedding night was all you hoped for.

112
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,920
我也相信你能理解我不想多做讨论
And I trust you'd understand if I'd prefer to keep it private.

113
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,290
当然
Absolutely.

114
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,470
慎重起见嘛
Discretion in all things.

115
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,160
不过既然你已经成婚了
But now that you are married,

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,340
那自然  你会比以往更让人垂涎若渴
of course, you'll be coveted more than ever.

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,340
此话怎讲
What do you mean?

118
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,140
对任何男人来说  被禁止的都是最具诱惑力的
Well, the most enticing aspect for any man is the forbidden.

119
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,650
可你必须无视
But you'll just have to forego

120
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,130
除你丈夫外  任何男人的目光
the looks from men other than your husband.

121
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,590
因为关注他们...
For to pay them any heed is really...

122
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,540
实在是一个女人的最不明智之举
Well, it's the worst thing that any woman could do.

123
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,510
我知道那不会有好下场
I've known women's lives come undone that way.

124
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,330
来  我帮你
Here, let me help you.

125
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,380
停
Stop!

126
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,760
我们休息片刻
We should rest a moment.

127
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,180
我要喝点水
I'll take some water.

128
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,300
您病了
You're sick.

129
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,290
我必须去卡米洛特  我要见那女孩
I need to go to Camelot. I have to see this girl.

130
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,670
您玉体欠安  我带您回去
You're not well enough. I'm taking you back.

131
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,000
不行
No!

132
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,060
恕我直言  您的健康是我的首要任务
With respect, your well-being is my priority.

133
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,970
您需要休息
You need to rest.

134
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,360
让我们来照顾您
Let us take care of you.

135
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,030
-你好  -殿下
- Hello. - Your Highness.

136
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,980
-不必如此拘礼  -我理应如此
- You know you don't have to do that. - I think I do.

137
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,570
我们之间现在是怎么了
What happens now? Between us?

138
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,870
什么也没有
Nothing.

139
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,440
我已为人妻
I committed myself.

140
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,950
你祝福了婚戒
You blessed the rings.

141
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,820
我整晚没睡
I didn't sleep the whole night.

142
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,220
我想着他在做什么
I thought about what he was doing.

143
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,210
亚瑟  别说了
Arthur, stop this.

144
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,310
他在行吗  他比我在行吗
Is he good? Is he better than me?

145
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,080
-这话太无礼了  -我想知道
- This isn't appropriate. - I want to know.

146
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,650
这与你无关
It has nothing to do with you!

147
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,160
海滩上的事
On the beach.

148
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,280
是有意义的
It meant something.

149
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,040
不
No.

150
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,970
没有
It didn't.

151
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,250
如果有  你觉得我还会嫁给他吗
If it had, do you think I could've married him?

152
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,740
那我成了什么人了
What sort of person would that have made me?

153
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,620
你把自己给了我
You gave yourself to me.

154
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,780
不管当时那人是谁
Whoever that person was,

155
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,180
她已经消失了
she's gone;

156
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,730
她死了
She's dead.

157
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,030
-那你现在成了什么人  -您护卫的妻子
- Who does that make you? - Your champion's wife.

158
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,890
乐意为您效劳
Honoured to serve you.

159
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,270
愿这能带给你幸福
Well, may it bring you much happiness.

160
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,030
我们到家了  您现在可以休息了
We're home. You can rest now.

161
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,890
不
No.

162
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,110
-把她赶走  -那个修女吗
- Get her out!  - The nun?

163
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,780
她怎么进来的  谁放她进来的
How did she get in? Who let her in?

164
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,880
赶她走  马上
Get her out of here! Now!

165
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,480
-快  -你都干了些什么
- Now.  - What have you done?

166
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,370
赶她走
Get her out!

167
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,200
我不想看到她出现在城堡里
I don't want her within sight of this castle.

168
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,580
我已吩咐卫兵了
I'll have the guards see to it.

169
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,460
不  别让他们去做
No, don't have them see to it!

170
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,400
你亲自去  确保万无一失
You see to it! Make sure it's happened.

171
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,540
当然
Of course.

172
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,830
她是谁
Who is she?

173
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,480
他们得添点柴火了
They need to build up this fire!

174
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,080
几乎没有热气
It's barely giving out any heat!

175
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,920
您很冷
You're cold.

176
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,720
-稍事休息会好的  -发烧而已
- Some rest will help.  - It's just a fever.

177
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,140
当然
Of course.

178
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,560
让我们照顾您吧
Let us look after you.

179
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,410
女侍们会带您回寝宫的
The girls will take you to your chamber.

180
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,440
那女人  不准出现在我视线里
That woman... not within sight.

181
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,440
盾牌是你的最佳盟友
The shield is your greatest ally.

182
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,200
这些看上去还不错
Now, these all look like fine shields.

183
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,530
但还少了点什么
But they're lacking.

184
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,340
你
You.

185
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,530
攻击我
Attack me.

186
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,140
凯
Kay!

187
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,100
在盾牌边缘加装刀片
Line the edge of your shield with a blade.

188
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,190
一把刀或是一把断剑
A knife  or the broken end of a sword.

189
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,280
你们的盾牌将不仅能够防御
Your shield then becomes not just a mode of defence,

190
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,470
还能够作为武器出击
but a weapon in itself.

191
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,140
你没事吧
You all right?

192
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,740
高文  你这个卑鄙小人
You're a dirty fighter, Gawain.

193
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,790
这是格斗  不是做饭
This is combat, not cooking.

194
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,160
我是实战教学
I train by example.

195
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,060
打伤战士就是训练吗
By injuring the warriors you're supposed to be training?

196
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,460
冷静点  别激动
Steady now. Don't get excited...

197
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,790
尤其你现在连剑都没有
Especially now you don't have a sword.

198
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,840
我不需要剑
I don't need a sword.

199
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,450
我需要的是一位德高望重的导师
But what I do need is an honourable instructor...

200
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,430
关于盾牌还有一事
One other thing on shields:

201
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,300
永远在盾牌上绑一把匕首以备不时之需
Always keep a dagger strapped to your shield for emergencies.

202
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,820
匕首是你的一部分
Your dagger is a part of you.

203
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,940
绝不能离身
It should never leave your side.

204
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,140
在上面写字刻字  让它成为你独有的
Inscribe it, carve it, make it your own,

205
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,960
这样不论身处何地  都不会弄混淆
so wherever you are, you'll never mistake it.

206
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,180
格斗还有一些规则  要冷漠无情
Some other rules of combat: Remove your emotions;

207
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,130
镇定自若
Keep calm;

208
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,490
挑衅对手  激发他们的怒气
Attempt to draw your opponent into battle using their anger.

209
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,490
这样他们将极易气馁
That way they're easily frustrated.

210
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,190
拿开你的刀
Take your blade from his throat.

211
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,190
我还是可以取走你和国王的项上人头
I could still take you and the king's head.

212
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,780
-放开他  -只是娱乐一下
- Let him go. - It's just a bit of fun.

213
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,690
让你的娱乐离我弟弟远点
Have your fun away from my brother.

214
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,900
高文  你听到他说的了
You heard what he said, Gawain.

215
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,260
没人可以胁持国王
Nobody threatens the king,

216
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,870
不管是训练还是玩笑
neither in training nor in jest.

217
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,950
-谢谢  -乐意效劳  殿下
- Thank you. - Pleasure, Your Highness.

218
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,810
你的将军和护卫英勇无畏
Your marshal and your champion have got some guts.

219
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,660
你还有一些支持者
And you have some men who'll stand up for you.

220
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,510
很好
Good.

221
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,170
薇薇安  我要用膳
Vivian, I need to eat.

222
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,360
给我食物  要很多  我饿极了
Bring me food. Lots of food. I'm starving.

223
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,890
您可以起来了吗
Should you be up?

224
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,020
您的气色确实好多了
You do look a lot better.

225
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,430
发烧而已
Just a fever.

226
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,840
我们明天去卡米洛特看看这个桂妮维尔
Tomorrow we'll go to Camelot to see this Guinevere.

227
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,750
摩根  抱歉
Morgan, I'm sorry.

228
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,930
她还在外面
She's still outside.

229
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,590
我试着赶走她  但她不肯离开
I tried to move her, but she wouldn't go.

230
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,250
她当然不会离开
Of course she wouldn't.

231
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,420
她到底是什么人
Who is she?

232
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,530
我父王把我放逐到海那边的修道院
My father banished me to a nunnery across the sea.

233
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,250
她教导过我
She taught me.

234
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,050
她不远万里来到这里
Well, she's come a long way.

235
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,560
您不想知道原因吗
You don't want to know why?

236
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,300
她待您很差吗
Did she treat you badly?

237
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,600
我不愿想起那个地方  我已经忘了那里
I don't think about that place now. I left it behind.

238
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,900
-那就不理她  -再来点面包
- So we ignore her. - I need more bread!

239
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,130
怎么了
What's the matter?

240
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,770
您的眼睛...
Your eyes...

241
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,040
只是一滴血
It's just a drop of blood.

242
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,680
不  摩根
No, Morgan,

243
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,290
不只是滴血
it's not.

244
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,960
到处是血
There's blood everywhere.

245
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,600
我该怎么办
What do I do?

246
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,910
你是谁
Who are you?

247
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,540
高文让我来的
Gawain sent me.

248
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,450
我为一把剑而来
I've come for a sword.

249
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,650
剑
A sword?

250
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,020
你的剑吗
For you?

251
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,470
不是
No.

252
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,380
那你可以走了
Then you'd better leave.

253
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,630
不然我把你劈成两半
Before I slit you from arse-hole to cake-hole.

254
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,490
是为了国王的剑
The sword's for the king.

255
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,280
那位新国王
The new king?

256
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,760
你转告这位国王
You tell this king,

257
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,780
如果他想要一把卡利伯恩的剑
if he wants one of Caliburn's swords,

258
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,620
他最好自己来拿
he damn well better get it for himself.

259
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,360
我是铸剑大师
I'm a master bladesmith,

260
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,610
不是什么村野铁匠
not some fucking village forge worker.

261
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,810
我所铸之剑  均为定制
Every sword I make is made to order...

262
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,320
是独一无二的
it's unique.

263
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,590
为他铸剑
To make him a sword,

264
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,110
我得知道他的体重
I'd need to know his weight,

265
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,820
他的挥剑动作
his swing,

266
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,200
他如何战斗   他天性如何
how he fights, what's in his blood.

267
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,250
你想知道的  我都可以告诉你
I can tell you everything you need to know.

268
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,090
-你和他如此亲近吗  -是的
- You're that close to him? - Yes.

269
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,300
你是何人
Who are you?

270
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,590
我叫梅林
My name's Merlin.

271
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,100
新国王派了个巫师来寻求宝剑
The new king sends a sorcerer for a sword.

272
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,530
你有着巫师的时机感
You have a sorcerer's sense of timing.

273
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,090
进来
Come inside.

274
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,250
让你看看我的魔法
I'll show you my magic.

275
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,620
你和其他人等
You and the rest of your household,

276
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,120
都回你们的房间去  关紧房门
go to your rooms. Lock the doors.

277
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,560
为什么
Why?

278
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,940
因为我吩咐你们这样做
Because I told you.

279
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,280
孩子  你看起来很糟
You look terrible, girl.

280
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,420
你是聋了还是蠢  滚
Are you deaf or just stupid? Go!

281
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,810
-如果你需要我...  -她不需要
- If you need me to... - She won't.

282
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,290
我没事
It's all right.

283
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,260
你并非没事  对吗
It's not all right, is it?

284
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,620
肯定很难受
It's not all right at all.

285
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,440
你呕吐过吗
Have you vomited?

286
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,490
-走一走  -什么
- Walk, then. - What?

287
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,680
走路  你知道什么是走路吧
Walk! You know what walking is, don't you?

288
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,730
起来  孩子
Stand up, child!

289
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,140
我办不到
I can't!

290
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,730
四肢逐渐变得无力
The limbs are weakening.

291
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,650
刚才还没有这些印迹
I didn't have them a moment ago.

292
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,040
你的身体正遭受摧残
Your body is under attack.

293
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,130
告诉我实情
Tell me honestly:

294
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,940
自从你离开我们
Since you left us,

295
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,890
你是否进行过召唤
have you performed a summoning?

296
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,940
你是否提了什么要求
Did you ask for anything?

297
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,470
是的
Yes.

298
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,500
我的孩子啊
Oh, my child.

299
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,180
你怎会如此鲁莽
How could you be so reckless?

300
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,930
我到底怎么了
What's happening to me?

301
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,160
很久以前
I told you

302
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,700
我就告诉过你
a long time ago,

303
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,060
你的傲慢终将摧毁你
your arrogance will be your downfall.

304
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,770
我还剩一件事没教你
I have one thing left to teach you.

305
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,580
我不需要你
I don't need you!

306
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,350
我该学的都学完了
I have nothing left to learn!

307
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,090
不
You do.

308
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,880
你还得学会死亡
You must learn to die.

309
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,520
不
No!!

310
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,560
他高大但不强壮
So he's tall but he's not strong.

311
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,410
打斗之时
And when he fights,

312
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,400
他有激情但过于冲动
he's passionate but too impulsive.

313
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,680
是的
Yes.

314
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,980
那他的剑得更重点
He needs to be weighted down more.

315
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,430
-应该没错  -我知道我没错
- You could be right. - I know I'm right.

316
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,460
我自己也曾是名战士
I was a warrior myself.

317
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,380
我以血为荣
I gloried in blood.

318
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,960
我的格言是屠戮沙场
Word of my approach could clear battlefields.

319
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,450
现在
These days,

320
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,140
我不再挥舞武器  而是打造它们
I build the weapons instead of brandishing them.

321
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,720
但某些月夜  风高之时
But some nights, when the wind rages,

322
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,190
我还会闻到阵阵血腥
I still get the smell of blood in my nostrils.

323
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,980
这把剑
This one.

324
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,700
很特别
It's special.

325
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,780
我用仅产于科罗曼德尔海岸的
I made it from an ingot of damascene steel

326
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,490
大马士革钢锻造
found only on the Coromandel shores.

327
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,420
加上精确的含碳量
The precise amount of carbon,

328
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,180
将让剑变得坚不可摧
and the sword becomes almost indestructible.

329
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,040
我从未能控制好各要素间的平衡
I never got the balance right.

330
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,610
直到现在
Until now.

331
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,650
此乃我手艺之巅峰
The zenith of my craft.

332
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,680
万宗归一
Everything in unity.

333
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,730
一把新的王者之剑
A new sword for a new king.

334
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,800
希望如此
Maybe.

335
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,460
那么...
So...

336
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,950
国王的巫师
The king's sorcerer.

337
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,560
你运用你的能力时
When you use your powers,

338
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,330
是什么感觉
how does it feel?

339
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,160
我不记得了
I don't remember.

340
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,320
怎么  你不再用了吗  为什么
What, you don't use them any more? Why not?

341
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,500
在那些激动人心的日子里  你运用之时
When you did, those heady days,

342
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,180
是什么感觉
what was it like?

343
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,510
像是一种别样的情绪
Like an extra emotion.

344
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,230
是吗
Really?

345
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,190
但如果你拥有这样的天赋
But if you have this gift,

346
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,030
为什么不用呢  为什么要克制
why not use it? Why deny yourself?

347
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,010
除非你心存恐惧
Unless you're scared.

348
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,530
不  不
No, no.

349
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,650
比恐惧更甚
It's more than that.

350
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,320
是因为你沉迷其中
Because you enjoy it.

351
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,330
你在干嘛
What're you doing?

352
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,210
你在那多久了
How long have you been there?

353
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:58,360
-什么  -你看到什么了
- What? - What did you see?

354
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,140
把你的刀从我女儿身上拿开
Take your knife from my daughter.

355
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,890
我以为你独居于此
I thought you lived alone.

356
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,500
我带来了食物
I brought food.

357
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,980
他和我们一起吃吗
Is he going to eat with us?

358
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,750
除非他不再威胁我的小姑娘
Not if he keeps threatening my little girl.

359
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,750
你知道他是谁吗
You know who this is?

360
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,090
著名巫师  梅林
The famous sorcerer, Merlin.

361
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,200
她是艾克斯卡利伯
Excalibur.

362
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,180
艾克斯卡利伯  他是梅林
Excalibur, Merlin.

363
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,470
我会给你们都弄点吃的
I'll make enough for both of you.

364
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,620
她很美
She's beautiful.

365
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,310
为了生她  她母亲死于难产
Her mother died giving birth to her.

366
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,430
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

367
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,680
你有家室吗
You have family?

368
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,270
现在没了
Not any more.

369
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,340
只有你的国王了
Just your king.

370
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,410
一起吃晚饭吧
Eat with us.

371
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,920
休整一宿
Then we rest.

372
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,430
明日一早
And in the morning,

373
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,600
国王的宝剑便会铸好了
you will have your sword for your king.

374
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,460
战士需要休息
A warrior needs his sleep.

375
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,860
国王更是如此
A king even more so.

376
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,170
今晚无法入睡了
Can't manage it tonight.

377
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,180
我有事请教
But I do have a question for you.

378
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,800
但说无妨
All right.

379
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,040
关于兵法
About strategy.

380
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,940
我可不是将领  只是区区一个士兵
I'm not a commander; I'm a soldier.

381
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,260
我曾读兵书
I've read about many battles,

382
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,800
习兵法
about the great strategists.

383
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,220
但仍有一事不甚明了
But what I don't understand is this:

384
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,150
如何知道何时该放弃
How do I know when it's time to give up?

385
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,410
何时该承认强者已然胜出
When do I acknowledge the better man's victory?

386
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
士兵从来不必操心这等事
See, the warrior would never do that.

387
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,240
他只需为信仰鞠躬尽瘁  死而后已
He'd fight to the death for something he believed in.

388
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,420
不过  在最糟之时
Of course, at the lowest moment,

389
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,100
倒是有一次机会
you have one opportunity.

390
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,760
此话怎讲
And what's that?

391
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,040
失去所有之时
When you have nothing to lose,

392
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,840
便是破釜沉舟之刻
that's the time to risk everything.

393
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,820
不要挣扎
Try not to struggle.

394
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,440
我不会死
I will not die.

395
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,590
帮我度过这一劫
Get me through this!

396
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,040
很好  就这样想
Good. You hold onto that.

397
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,740
别忘了
And remember,

398
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,010
你来这里是有所图的
you came back here for a reason.

399
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,600
王位
The crown.

400
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,360
王位对你意味几何
How much does it mean to you?

401
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,240
-一...  -我听不见  说出来
- Ev... - I can't hear you! Talk!

402
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,110
一切
Everything.

403
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,600
什么
What?

404
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,830
一切
Everything!

405
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,750
那就斗下去
Then fight!

406
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,590
你罪有应得
You deserved what you got.

407
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,070
父王
Father.

408
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,250
可怜的弱者
Weak little wretch!

409
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,570
宣誓效忠于本王
Swear your fealty!

410
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,940
狡猾的贱货
Clever bitch!

411
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,860
我没有你这个女儿
I no longer have a daughter.

412
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,070
阴险的贱货  可怜的弱者
Clever bitch! Weak little wretch!

413
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,000
你会被私生子打得落花流水
Beaten by a bastard.

414
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,610
可怜的弱者  被私生子打得落花流水
Weak little wretch! Beaten by a bastard.

415
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,180
我不会被打败
I'm not beaten!

416
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,980
你罪有应得  你会一无所有
You deserve what you got... nothing!

417
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,010
摩根  摩根
Morgan! Morgan!

418
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,750
摩根  听着
Morgan, listen!

419
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,260
你有多渴望得到王位
How much do you want the crown?

420
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,390
有多渴望活下去
How much do you want to live?

421
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,200
一把新的王者之剑
A new sword for a new king.

422
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,840
我以血为荣
I gloried in blood.

423
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,100
大功告成
It's done.

424
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,960
此乃出自我手的至尊之剑
The best I've ever made.

425
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,170
永不磨损  无坚可摧
Almost indestructible.

426
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,650
能否一试
Can I?

427
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,270
我要亲自呈给国王
I'll give it to the king myself.

428
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,160
你想拿我的成果邀功请赏
You want the credit for my work.

429
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,640
不  但我不想让你靠近国王
No. But I don't need you near my king.

430
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,380
难道我能为他铸此宝剑
I'm good enough to make him a weapon,

431
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,020
却不配亲自觐见
but not to stand in his presence?

432
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,840
你身上仍有杀气
You still have the smell of blood in your nostrils.

433
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,750
而你仍会施巫术
And you still have sorcery within you.

434
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,400
宝剑你休想拿走
The sword stays with me.

435
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,740
你只要铸好宝剑即可
You shaped it for the king.

436
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,140
我要将它呈给国王
And I'm taking it to him.

437
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,690
凭你
You?

438
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,670
把剑交给我
Give me the sword.

439
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,900
自己来取
Take it.

440
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,800
来啊  以为我不会还手吗
Come on. You think I won't fight back?

441
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,480
你若还有家人  我会送他们去和你团聚
And if you still had a family, they'd be next!

442
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,820
不准提他们
Don't speak of them!

443
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,300
你做了什么
What've you done?

444
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,380
-只是意外  -不  你杀了他
- There was an accident. - No, you killed him!

445
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,020
不  不  不  不...
No, no, no, no...

446
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,510
-你就为这个杀了他  -把剑给我
- You killed him for this? - Give me the sword.

447
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,370
把剑给我
Give me the sword.

448
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,130
你永远别想得到这把剑
You'll never have this sword!

449
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,600
艾克斯卡利伯  别跑  拜托
Excalibur, wait! Please!

450
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,340
只是意外
It was an accident!

451
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,710
艾克斯卡利伯  停下来
Excalibur, stop!

452
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,330
别过来
Stay away from me!

453
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,510
把剑给我
Give me the sword.

454
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,240
-求你把剑给我  -不
- Please, give it to me. - No!

455
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,620
这把剑只应葬身湖底
The only place for it is the bottom of this lake!

456
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:19,590
宝剑非我王莫属
The king must have his sword...

457
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,720
别过来
Stay away from me!

458
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,400
别追我
Leave me alone!

459
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,010
走开
Go away!

460
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,320
别动
Stay where you are.

461
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,800
艾克斯卡利伯  别动
Excalibur, don't move!

462
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,780
艾克斯卡利伯
Excalibur!

463
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,750
不
No!

464
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,310
艾克斯卡利伯
Excalibur!

465
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,870
艾克斯卡利伯
Excalibur!

466
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,870
坚持住  坚持住
Stay with me! Stay with me!

467
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,340
坚持住
Stay with me!

468
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,710
不
No!

469
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,190
不
No!

470
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,200
坚持住
Stay with me!

471
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,450
对不起
I'm sorry.

472
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,040
可怜的孩子
You poor child.

473
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,090
摩根
Morgan!

474
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,450
你是谁
Who are you?

475
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,920
呼吸
Breathe!

476
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,080
呼吸  慢点  慢点
Breathe! Slowly! Slowly!

477
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,820
我没死
I lived.

478
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,520
慢慢来
Go slowly.

479
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,150
你错了  你说我会死
You were wrong; You said I'd die.

480
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,620
你重生了
You were reborn.

481
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,520
因为我命硬
Because I'm strong.

482
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,630
摩根
Morgan.

483
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,400
别碰我  怎么回事
Stay away from me! Oh, what's this?

484
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,910
上帝啊
Dear God.

485
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,970
怎么了
What?

486
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,580
不...
No...

487
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,160
不  不要是她
No! No, not her!

488
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,760
谁都可以  不要是她  不
No, anyone but her! No!

489
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,940
-冷静 冷静  冷静  -不
- Stop! Stop! Stop! - No!

490
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,750
不  不  我无法接受
No, no! I can't bear it!

491
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,310
别反抗  要去适应
Don't fight it. Settle.

492
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,850
适应
Settle.

493
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,280
感受她的内心
Inside her.

494
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,940
呼吸
Breathe.

495
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,000
呼吸  呼吸  呼吸
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

496
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,440
很好
Good.

497
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,870
怎么  怎么了
What? What is it?

498
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,530
我能感觉到她
I can feel her.

499
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,500
我能感其所感
I can feel what she's feeling.

500
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,890
她很痛苦
She's feeling pain.

501
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,150
会有其他人适合你的
There'll be another one for you.

502
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,610
我是说桂妮维尔
Guinevere.

503
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,190
我看到你看她的眼神了
I saw the way you looked at her.

504
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,720
你会找到其他人选的
You'll find another.

505
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,700
这是你作为母亲的建议吗
Is that your motherly advice?

506
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,100
我是想保护你
I'm trying to protect you.

507
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,700
到别处找找看吧
Look somewhere else.

508
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,270
你也是这么跟我父亲说的吗
Is that what you told my father?

509
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,490
你知道损失有多惨重吗
Do you have you any idea how much was destroyed?

510
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,680
你知道因为没人阻止他  有多少人丧命吗
How many people died because he wouldn't be denied?

511
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,290
我不会让悲剧重演的
I will not let that happen again.

512
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,260
你迟到了  殿下
You're late... Your Highness.

513
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,890
想知道我的价值观是吧
You want to know my values.

514
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,570
听好了  杀戮之时  我们要心怀慈悲
Well, here they are: when we have to kill, we do it with mercy.

515
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,330
要知道我们任重而道远
We do it knowing we have a higher course.

516
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,580
我们要为和平而战
We fight for peace.

517
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,460
自相矛盾
Contradiction in terms.

518
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,290
不  要练习作战  但更要实践和平
No. Train for battle; Practice peace.

519
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,620
战斗只是我们实现其他目标的手段  荣誉
Combat is the means by which we achieve other things: honour,

520
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,950
保卫  正义等  我们并非为了战斗而战斗
protection, justice. It is not an end in itself.

521
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,500
说完了吗
Is that it?

522
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,650
没有
No.

523
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,140
跟我打
Fight me.

524
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,080
放倒我
Take me down.

525
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,440
没事的
It's fine.

526
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,130
要明白对方比你强
Understand when you've been beaten by a better man.

527
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,550
但永远不要放弃
But never give in!

528
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,740
永远  不放弃
Never, give in.

529
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,180
即使你觉得自己已一无所有
Even if it feels like you've lost everything.

530
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,910
如果为了目的而必须不择手段
And if you have to fight dirty to protect your cause...

531
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:06,580
那就不择手段吧
Then so be it.

532
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,920
这才像话
Now this,

533
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,130
这才是我能与之共事的国王
this is a king I can do business with.

534
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,350
我知道你在做什么  你得停手
I know what you're doing and you have to stop.

535
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,080
我不明白你的意思
I don't know what you mean.

536
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,510
我得对里昂提斯负责
I have a duty to Leontes.

537
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,330
你得对你的人民负责
You have a duty to your people.

538
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,690
我们要各尽其职  之前的事只是过眼云烟
We follow our duties and nothing we did before matters.

539
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,450
告诉我你得偿所愿了  那我就停手
Tell me you have what you want, and I'll stop.

540
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,100
我看到你的所作所为了
I saw what you did.

541
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,870
我不是一场你能赢得的打斗
I'm not a fight you can win.

542
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,500
你看着我的眼睛说出来  我就停手
I'll stop if you look at me in the eye and say it.

543
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,290
我很幸福
I'm happy.

544
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,920
我得偿所愿了
I have what I want.

545
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,870
那就到此为止了
Then it's finished.

546
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,020
-国王万岁  -我得为此干一杯
- Long live the king! - I'll drink to that.

547
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,090
蠢货
Fools.

548
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,890
你说什么
What did you say?

549
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:48,360
我说你娘生你的时候肯定受了刺激
I said your mother must've wept the day she bore you...

550
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:49,840
你俩都是
Both of you.

551
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:54,010
我猜你们是兄弟吧  真够丑的
I assume you're brothers... you're ugly enough.

552
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,070
这也叫打人
Call that a punch?

553
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,220
你为何前来
Why did you come?

554
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,160
修道院被烧毁了
The nunnery burned.

555
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,340
我们受到了袭击
We were attacked.

556
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,130
我是唯一的幸存者
I was the only survivor.

557
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,500
我独自一人  这令我恐惧
I'm alone; It frightens me.

558
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,240
我是被指引到这里的
I was drawn here

559
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,510
恰恰在你最需要我的时候
just when you needed me.

560
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,870
-我不需要你  -你离开我们来寻求王位
- I don't need you. - You left us to get the crown.

561
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,590
至今仍未得手
You don't have it yet.

562
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,440
薇薇安
Vivian.

563
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,980
给这女人收拾一间客房
Make up a bed for this woman.

564
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,920
离我的寝宫越远越好
As far away from my chamber as you can find.

565
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,280
遵命
Of course.

566
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,830
你怎么了
What happened to you?

567
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:40,340
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

568
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,420
当然有所谓
Of course it does.

569
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,870
你的剑
Your sword.

570
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,770
天啊
Oh, my God.

571
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,910
简直非同凡响
It's extraordinary.

572
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,570
真美啊
It's a thing of beauty.

573
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,180
谢谢
Thank you.

574
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:29,080
得给它起个名字
It needs a name.

575
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,360
已经有名字了
It already has a name.

576
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,830
是我让你去找的那个卡利伯恩造的吗
Is it from Caliburn, the man I sent you to see?

577
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,250
不  我到的时候他已经去世了
No. When I got there, he was dead.

578
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,960
我又骑马前行了一段路
I rode many miles.

579
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,570
来到了一座湖边
Until I came to a lake.

580
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:55,130
四周都是迷雾
And everywhere there was a mist.

581
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:57,720
我只好停了下来
I had to stop.

582
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,370
然后
And when I did...

583
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,810
当我走出迷雾
Out of the mist...

584
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:11,740
一个女人呼唤着我的名字
A woman called to me...

585
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,540
宛如海妖
Like a Siren.

586
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,740
Siren是希腊神话中一种半人半鸟的海妖
常用歌声使得过往水手倾听失神  导致航船触礁沉没

587
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,310
她从湖里
From within the lake...

588
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,170
伸出了手臂
She stretched out her arm...

589
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,940
这把剑
This sword,

590
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,330
就握在她手中
clutching it.

591
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,530
我接过了剑
I took the sword...

592
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,380
向她致谢
And thanked her.

593
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,910
她莞尔一笑
She smiled...

594
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,220
退回了湖中
And slipped back into the water.

595
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,340
同时
And as she did...

596
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,190
她说
She said,

597
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,370
"此乃亚瑟王之剑"
"This is the sword of King Arthur."

598
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,670
"名曰"
"This..."

599
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,990
"王者之剑"
"Is Excalibur".

600
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:33,490
Excalibur -- 王者之剑或圣剑
音译即艾克斯克利伯   前段在湖中溺死的女孩
此处梅林虚构的故事其实是更为普及的传说版本
即圣剑是由湖中女妖从湖中托出的
