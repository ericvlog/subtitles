今晚  你们将为了摩根·彭德拉根而战
Tonight,you fight for the cause of Morgan Pendragon.

14
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,810
夺走她王位的人就在那建筑里
The man who wears her crown stands in that building.

15
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,340
太阳一定会在他破碎焦黑的尸首上升起
The sun must rise on his shredded,burning corpse.

16
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,930
现在  有谁自信可以杀死亚瑟
Now,which one of you believes he can take the sword

17
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,160
夺取宝剑带回给我
from the king's dead hands,and bring it to me?

18
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,100
援军正在路上
More men are on their way,

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,070
但凭借夜色的掩护  我们会派出探子
but we have the cover of night,and we'll send an advance scout

20
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,840
刺探那里还剩多少人
to find out how many are left in there.

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,820
亚瑟说会在此跟我们会合
Arthur said he would meet us here.

22
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,230
我们暂时驻扎在此吧
We should shelter here for now;

23
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,550
看看伤员的伤势
see to the wounded.

24
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,500
我们在这里等亚瑟
We'll wait here for Arthur.

25
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,730
你很幸运
You were lucky.

26
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,250
不觉得
Don't feel it.

27
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,040
看到他了吗
Any sign of him?

28
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,550
没有
No.

29
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,250
他说过随后就来的
He said he'd be right behind us.

30
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,390
他留下是为了向我们证明自己
He stayed behind to prove himself to us.

31
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,070
向我证明
To me.

32
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,900
我早该料到的
I should have known.

33
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,110
固执的混蛋
Stubborn bastard.

34
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,380
他要对付多少人
How many is he up against?

35
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,400
他去了很久了
It's been too long.

36
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,900
该你了
Your turn.

37
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,820
快点
Hurry.

38
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,700
分散开
Spread out.

39
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,210
我们抓到他了
We've got him!

40
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,120
拿着剑  全速回去
Take the sword. As fast as you can.

41
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,210
我来解决这小子
I'll finish off the boy.

42
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,190
别叫我小子
Don't call me boy.

43
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,240
豪威尔
Harwell!

44
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,130
华莱士呢
Where's Wallace?

45
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,580
在解决国王  他让我将这个带给你
Finishing off the king. He told me to bring you this.

46
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,700
他们包围了孤军奋战的亚瑟
They have Arthur surrounded. He's alone in there.

47
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,420
带上我的问候  直接交给摩根
Take it straight to Morgan,with my compliments.

48
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,970
骑快点  我随后跟上
Ride fast. I'll follow you.

49
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,170
等我一把火烧了国王的尸首就跟上
After I've put a burning torch to the king's body.

50
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,480
国王在哪里  他在吗  我要见我王弟
Where is the king? Is he here? I need to see my brother!

51
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,740
亚瑟王正在巴尔东击退敌军
King Arthur is out at Bardon Pass,repelling an attack.

52
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,260
-伊格兰夫人  -放开国王的母亲
- ...Lady Igraine this way! - Untie the king's mother!

53
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,700
放开他们
Release them!

54
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,700
在你们行动之前  听着
Before you do anything,listen.

55
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,320
国家正处于危难之中
The realm is under threat.

56
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,720
这巫师和国王的母亲闯入了我们的城堡
The sorcerer and the king's mother ransacked our castle,

57
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,090
威胁摩根的生命
threatened Morgan's life!

58
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,400
这些是来自四方的人民
These people have come from all over the realm.

59
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,970
他们遭受了袭击
They've been attacked.

60
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,120
需要国王的保护
They need their king's protection.

61
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,390
我知道卡米洛特的许多男人
I know many of Camelot's men are

62
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,160
正在外围剿叛乱
out in the realm fighting these insurgencies.

63
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,920
我的护卫可以帮助你们
My guards can help you.

64
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,580
你们的眼睛都是雪亮的
You are good men of strong judgment.

65
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,930
作出判断吧
Use it now.

66
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,820
拘押巫师
Restrain the sorcerer,

67
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,690
在我王弟回来之前  给我们保护吧
and give us protection until the king,my brother,returns.

68
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,270
真奇妙  孩子们在哪都能睡着
It's amazing how children can sleep anywhere.

69
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,020
抱歉
Sorry.

70
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,650
因为他们天真无邪
It's innocence.

71
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,880
不知道未来会有何种凶险
They don't know what's to come.

72
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,750
桂妮维尔
Guinevere,

73
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,320
她怎样了
how is she?

74
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,470
刀伤没什么大碍
That's all right for a sword wound,

75
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,510
但箭伤永远不会痊愈
but an arrow wound will never heal.

76
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,840
-拿着  -好的
- Hold this.  - Of course.

77
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,290
准备好了吗
Ready?

78
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,640
给我
Here.

79
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,240
好了
It's done.

80
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,960
关城门
Seal the gates!

81
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,450
我们一定要保卫卡米洛特
We must protect Camelot from any attack.

82
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,560
进去  给自己找庇护和食物
Go inside. Find yourselves shelter and food.

83
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,800
当国王归来  我们会向他请愿
When the king returns,we shall all address him.

84
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,140
谢谢  夫人
Thank you,milady.

85
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,820
护送伊格兰夫人回房
Escort Lady Igraine to her room.

86
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,890
确保她舒适自在  但不得四处走动
Make sure she's comfortable and that she remains there.

87
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,180
我都看见了  你不会得逞的
I see what you are doing,and you shall not prevail.

88
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,440
我稍后去看你  夫人
I'll visit you shortly,my lady.

89
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
你可享受我们共度的那晚
Did you enjoy our night together?

90
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,760
你真以为我是她吗
Did you really think I was her?

91
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,360
我还不错吧  因为那晚...
Was I that good? Because you were...

92
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,390
你棒极了
...fascinating.

93
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,850
她知道吗
Does she know?

94
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,300
你告诉她我们的事了吗
Have you told her what we did?

95
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,030
告诉他你如何辗转索欢了吗
How you gave yourself?

96
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,910
你想怎样对付我都行
Do what you want with me...

97
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,080
但不要碰伊格兰
...but leave Igraine alone.

98
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,090
痛不欲生是吧
It burns, doesn't it?

99
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,630
那种爱莫能助的感觉
That sense of impotence.

100
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,500
看着自己倾尽心血的一切被人剥夺
Watching what you've worked for snatched from you.

101
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,240
好好盯着他  他可是无所不能
Keep a watch on him. He's capable of anything.

102
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,630
谁派你来的
Who sent you?!

103
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,050
问这个有什么用
Wha-wha-what does it matter?

104
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,510
当然有用
Oh, it matters.

105
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,010
你为谁效力
Who do you fight for?!

106
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,510
谁派你来的
Who sent you?

107
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,910
谁
Who?

108
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,500
最后一次机会
Last chance.

109
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,110
摩根·彭德拉根
Morgan Pendragon.

110
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,810
你撒谎
You're lying.

111
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,770
袭击巴尔东关口
Attack Bardon Pass.

112
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,600
引出国王
Draw out the king.

113
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,280
趁他率兵抵抗  一举将其歼杀
Kill him when he shows up to defend it.

114
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,650
这是你姐姐的命令
Those were your sister's orders.

115
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,090
你们家可真他妈乱透了
You're a fucked-up family, all right.

116
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,010
旗子还在飘  华莱士没回来
The banner flies, and Wallace hasn't returned.

117
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,880
亚瑟肯定还没死
Arthur must still be alive.

118
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,820
怎么可能  让我带两个人下去
How is that possible?! Let me go down, take 2 men.

119
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,170
不  不  等待援军
No! No, wait for reinforcements.

120
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,500
我人手足够
I have enough men coming

121
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,640
管他什么阵法我都照打不误
to overwhelm whatever tricks he has lined up in there.

122
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,890
你们在卡米洛特是安全的
You will be safe here in Camelot.

123
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,710
把卡米洛特当成你们的避难之地吧
Let Camelot be your refuge.

124
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,270
上帝会庇佑一切
God will provide.

125
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,260
夫人  请问国王在哪里
Milady, where is the king?

126
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,920
为什么他不在这里
Why isn't he here?

127
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,140
你这是明知故问
You know where he is.

128
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,120
他当然是在捍守边疆
Protecting the border of his realm.

129
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:50,880
有人说
People are saying

130
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,940
他和护卫之妻私奔逃走了
that he has run off with his champion's wife.

131
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,550
不许这样中伤我弟弟
Don't speak about my brother in that way.

132
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,320
没有女人能让他弃国家大任于不顾
No woman would distract him from his duties.

133
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,700
桂妮薇尔肯定在这里
Guinevere must be here.

134
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,040
我们去找到她  向大家澄清一切
Let us find her and prove the truth to you.

135
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,440
任何人不许接近他
No one's to go near him.

136
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,950
他是囚犯  又不是动物
He's a prisoner, not an animal.

137
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,620
你看见伊格兰了吗
Have you seen Igraine?

138
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,790
没有
I don't know.

139
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,650
摩根在走廊安排了守卫
Morgan has her guards all along the corridor.

140
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,240
我哪儿都去不了
I can't go anywhere.

141
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,480
你为什么不挣脱
Why don't you break free?

142
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,820
挣脱又怎样
And do what? Hmm?

143
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,900
做个与人民为敌的疯巫师吗
The mad sorcerer against the people?

144
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,160
他们不会再信任我了
They'll never trust me again.

145
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,730
我们需要亚瑟回来
We need Arthur back.

146
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,470
他不来怎么办
What if he doesn't come?

147
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,490
他会的
He will.

148
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,300
我们要相信他会回来
We have to believe he will.

149
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,300
我说过我不想被人打扰
I said I didn't want to be disturbed.

150
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,410
我想你会想看到这个  孩子
I think you'll want to see this, child.

151
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,030
国王之剑
The king's sword.

152
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,950
这是豪威尔的心意
A gift from Harwell.

153
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,970
事成了
It's done?

154
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,420
是的
It is.

155
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,810
真不幸
It's a tragedy.

156
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,960
-都是按照您的指示  -退下吧
- It's what you ordered. - Leave her--

157
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,130
她要为弟弟默哀片刻
to grieve her brother.

158
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,870
我们的时代到了
This is our time.

159
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,850
这是最后一击
This is our final assault.

160
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,540
找到亚瑟
Find Arthur.

161
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,980
把他给我带来  准备好了吗
You bring him to me. We ready?

162
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,200
-准备好了  -开始进攻
- Aye! Yeah! - Then we attack!

163
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,120
在那边
Over there!

164
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,150
你回来了
You came back.

165
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,890
我曾立誓要保护你
I took an oath.

166
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,630
趴下
Down!

167
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,420
里昂提斯
Leontes!

168
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,520
即便今日将命丧于此
If I'm going down,

169
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,730
我也要尽量多杀几个陪葬的
I'm taking as many of them with me as I can.

170
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,880
说得好
Amen to that.

171
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,740
茁逄?

172
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,770
为卡米洛特
For Camelot.

173
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,320
快跑
Run!

174
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,750
快跑
Run!

175
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,840
撤
Retreat!

176
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,870
一群浑蛋
Stupid bastards!

177
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,700
亚瑟小心
Arthur!!

178
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,560
不
No!

179
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,280
里昂提斯
Leontes!

180
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,280
里昂提斯
Leontes!

181
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,230
答应我  要以战士之礼葬我
Promise me a warrior's funeral.

182
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,050
我对不起你
I'm sorry.

183
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,150
没关系  我将去追随我的上帝了
It's all right. I get to meet my God.

184
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,990
好好待她
Treasure her.

185
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,450
我知道你肯定不愿错过这个
I know you'd hate to miss this.

186
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,050
我们这位因仁爱而受难的普罗米修斯
Our very own Prometheus brought low by his love of men.

187
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,830
此乃国王之剑
This is the king's sword.

188
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,030
我刚刚得知
Just brought to me with news...

189
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,900
国王已逝
...of his death.

190
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,710
我为弟弟之死伤心欲绝
My heart breaks for my brother.

191
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,820
那现在怎么办
What now?

192
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,940
谁来保护我们
Who protects us?

193
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,730
谁来继承王位
Who will take the crown?

194
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,090
这些我无权决定
I cannot decide that.

195
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,650
-应该由你继承  -对
- It should be you. - Yes.

196
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,550
承蒙诸位信任  我不胜感动  但...
Your belief touches me, but I...

197
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,330
你责无旁贷
There is... no one else.

198
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,050
你应担起保护百姓之大任
You owe it to your father and your brother

199
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,190
以告慰你父亲和弟弟在天之灵
not to leave these people unprotected.

200
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,650
她说得对
She's right.

201
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,090
摩根  你对在场的人们
Morgan, you have an obligation

202
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,650
对这片土地上的所有人民
to everyone here,

203
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,900
都有庇佑之责
to everyone in the land.

204
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:33,240
要想走出这黑暗
Out of this... darkness,

205
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,690
这个王国必须拥立第一位女王
the realm must know its first queen.

206
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,190
正是
Yes.

207
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,560
请回应我们
Answer us, please.

208
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,140
这真是你们的意愿吗
Is it truly your will?

209
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,610
是
Yes.

210
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,740
那么...
Then...

211
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,200
...我接受
...I accept,

212
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,300
秉承我弟弟的遗愿
in my brother's memory,

213
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,970
继续发扬彭德拉根精神
to carry on the Pendragon line.

214
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,990
我特地为你挑了这衣服
I picked that out for you.

215
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,000
刚才那套太不像样了
You were looking a bit dishevelled.

216
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,350
你得穿得漂漂亮亮的
You must look your best.

217
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,530
你永远做不了女王
You will never be queen.

218
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,040
你可以生一个国王
You can give birth to a king,

219
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,770
或嫁一个国王
or you marry one,

220
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,150
但你绝对戴不了王冠
but you won't ever get that crown.

221
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,880
你为何要假冒我
Why did you take my face?

222
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,060
我也问过自己同样的问题
I asked myself that same question.

223
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,050
那并不是我选的
It wasn't my choice,

224
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,170
但我现在知道原因了
but now I understand why.

225
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,980
你是所有这一切的起因
You're the birth of all this.

226
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,440
可怜的孩子
You poor child.

227
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,810
这些年你身上到底发生了什么
What happened to you these years?

228
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,270
你令我父女反目
What happened

229
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,120
这就是发生了什么
is that you turned my father against me.

230
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,020
你没来之前  他爱我毫无保留
Until you came, he loved me without question.

231
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,750
接着你和你的小杂种来了
And then you, and your bastard child.

232
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,500
你永远不会明白
You never understood.

233
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,030
现在无所谓了
It doesn't matter now.

234
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,990
你看起来真美  夫人
You look beautiful, my lady.

235
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,960
你想从我这里得到什么
What do you want from me?

236
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,560
慢慢折磨死你
A slow death.

237
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,710
没关系
It's all right.

238
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,770
这虽然致命
It's fatal.

239
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,150
但到你流血致死还有些时候
But it will take some time for you to bleed out.

240
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,360
伊格兰皇后
Queen Igraine.

241
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,340
现在看看你
Look at you now

242
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,390
我父亲深爱的脸蛋  爱到不惜将我流放
that face my father loved enough to banish me.

243
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,500
他没打算流放你
He didn't banish you!

244
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,570
他本想杀了你
He was going to have you killed

245
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,540
就像杀你母亲一样
like your mother.

246
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,600
我把你送走  是为了保护你的安全
I sent you away to keep you safe!

247
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,300
你在说谎
You're lying!

248
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,680
是我救了你
I saved you!

249
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,740
我不信
I don't believe you.

250
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,890
我怜悯你
I took pity on you!

251
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,680
你永远做不了女王
You will never be queen!

252
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,740
他们回来了  是亚瑟
They're coming. It's Arthur!

253
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,920
准备好了吗
Ready?

254
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,250
是真的吗  我做到了吗
Is this it? Have I done it?

255
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,670
是的  我的孩子
Yes, my child.

256
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,460
万事俱备
This was everything.

257
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,400
我明白
I know.

258
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,840
现在登上你的宝座吧  我的女王
Now take your throne, my queen.

259
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,630
你是否愿意发誓
Will you swear

260
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,640
依据法律  和风俗人情
to rule this realm according to the laws

261
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,980
治理这个国家
and customs of its people,

262
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,570
并宽严相济
and to administer justice

263
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,170
执行审判
with mercy?

264
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,000
我愿意
I will.

265
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,830
你是否愿意维护上帝的律法
Will you uphold too the laws of God

266
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,860
和真正的福音教义
and the true teachings of his gospel?

267
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,250
我愿意
I will.

268
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,050
以此王冠为证  我宣布  摩根
With this crown, I anoint you, Morgan,

269
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,230
成为大不列颠首位女王
First Queen of the Britons.

270
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,500
国王回来了
It's the king!

271
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,440
弟弟
My brother!

272
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,300
你还活着
You live!

273
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,790
我知道你的真面目了  姐姐
I know your true face, sister.

274
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,140
一旦听说我的死讯
One rumour of my death,

275
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,230
你们就拥戴新君主
and you proclaim a new leader!

276
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,450
这对国王可是极大的不敬
A king could get offended.

277
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,500
伊格兰在哪里
Where's Igraine?

278
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,610
-你见过伊格兰吗  -没
-Have you seen Igraine? - No.

279
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,040
但我不愿迁怒于你们
Which is hard,

280
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,160
因为我记得在我的加冕礼上
because I remember standing here at my coronation

281
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,470
看到你们眼中充满希望
and seeing hope in all your eyes.

282
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,960
之后我学到了很多
I've learned so much since then.

283
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,100
也犯过一些错误
And I have made mistakes.

284
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,920
但我现在只为一件事而活
But I live for one thing now.

285
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,180
那就是
Your hope.

286
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,950
传承你们的希望
And how to deliver on it.

287
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,480
我们遭受攻击时  你在哪里
We were attacked! Where were you?

288
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,080
-你跑了  -你在哪里
- You went away. - Where were you?

289
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,490
我在哪里  摩根
Where was I, Morgan?

290
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,930
如果她戴上王冠
If she takes the crown,

291
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,130
我来告诉你们可以得到什么
I'll tell you what you get.

292
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,410
恐惧
Fear!

293
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,140
她把恐惧灌输给每个人
That's what she instils in everyone.

294
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,080
恐惧比希望更强大
Fear is so much stronger than hope.

295
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,820
但永远不会获胜
But it will never win.

296
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,930
我要拿回我的剑和王冠
I'll take my sword and my crown.

297
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,840
没那么容易
It's not that easy.

298
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,500
你民心已失
You've lost the will of the people.

299
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,420
那属于国王
That belongs to the king.

300
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,240
闪开
Out of my way!

301
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,330
告诉他们  她干了什么
Tell them what she did.

302
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,600
摩根密谋反叛国王
Morgan plotted against the king.

303
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,670
昨晚我们攻击了巴尔东关口
We were to attack Bardon Pass last night.

304
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,710
我们接到命令  杀死国王
We were sent with orders: kill the king.

305
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,230
他是个骗子  他为了活命信口雌黄
He's a liar. Talking to save his life!

306
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,100
我的护卫  里昂提斯  死在你的人手里
My champion, Leontes, died at the hands of your men.

307
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,710
别听信谎言
You accept the words of liars

308
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,060
他想离间我们
who'd wish to disrupt our unity!

309
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,670
你为何当面誓言旦旦
Why would you profess your loyalty to me in public,

310
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,650
暗地却加害于我
while sending men to kill me in private?

311
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,680
你该知道背叛的惩罚
You understand the punishment for treason.

312
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,170
你还有什么话可说
Have you anything else to say?

313
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,930
不能怪罪她
It wasn't her!

314
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,140
是我指使的
It was me.

315
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,470
我谋划了一切
I planned it all.

316
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,520
摩根毫不知情
I told Morgan none of this.

317
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,090
她也许能正当地成为女王
She may be queen by rights,

318
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,810
但我们的律法是由劳苦大众创造的
but our laws are made by feeble men.

319
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,870
我对叛国罪供认不讳  任凭你们处置
I confess to my treason. Do whatever you want with me.

320
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,970
摩根对此毫不知情
Morgan knew none of it.

321
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,130
抓住她
Hold her.

322
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,140
你知道叛国罪和谋杀罪
You understand the punishment

323
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,450
将被判死刑
for treason and murder is execution.

324
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,220
一切都只是她一人所为吗
Was this all her own doing?

325
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,880
我永远不会密谋反叛你  我的弟弟
I would never plot against you,my brother.

326
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,260
你手上血债累累了
You have blood on your hands.

327
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,990
伊格兰
Igraine.

328
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,430
你来了
You came.

329
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,250
怎么回事  谁干的
What happened? Who did this?

330
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,840
我快死了
I'm dying,

331
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,400
对吗
aren't I?

332
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,650
不  不
No,no.

333
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,800
我不会让你死的  我不让
I won't let you. I won't let you.

334
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,670
你听到了吗
You hear me?

335
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,790
你在做什么
What are you doing?!

336
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,120
我不让你死  我不让
I won't let you. I won't let you.

337
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,380
我不想再失去任何人了
I will not lose anyone else.

338
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,390
住手
Stop!

339
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,290
住手
Stop!

340
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,860
不  不
No,no!

341
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,400
我不让你以命换命
Not by killing yourself!

342
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,440
我可以救你
I can save you.

343
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,120
保护
Protect...

344
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,460
亚瑟
...Arthur.

345
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,580
请求你
Please.

346
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,430
对不起
I'm sorry.

347
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,560
并非你的过错
It's not your fault.

348
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,210
我发誓
I swear...

349
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,360
我一定不会辜负你的期望
...I will be everything you ever hoped I'd be.

350
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,010
我会比你期望的更好
I will be better.

351
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,200
我会让你以我为豪
And I will make you proud.

352
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,900
我会为你  为我所有的家人
I will build it all here for you.

353
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,910
振兴这里
For all my family.

354
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,820
永别了
Goodbye...

355
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,860
母亲
...Mother.

356
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,020
这就是我的长眠之地吗
Is this where I am to sleep for eternity?

357
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,990
你还指望什么
What did you expect?

358
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,880
盛大的国葬吗
Pomp and glory?

359
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,130
跪下
Kneel.

360
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,380
怎么
What?

361
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,490
我还以为她会来
I thought that she would come.

362
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,610
跪下
Kneel.

363
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,550
世间无上帝
There is no God.

364
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,770
我知道你杀了我母亲
I know you killed my mother.

365
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,120
你的修女承担了罪责  但她并无动机
Your nun confessed to it,but she had no motive.

366
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,800
她站在处刑人的剑下
She stood before the executioner's sword

367
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,430
从容不迫  就好像她是你的护卫
as if she were your champion.

368
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,730
我对你城堡的保护到此为止
My protection of your castle is at an end.

369
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,520
这个
And this--

370
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:30,180
这是属于你的国王的
this belongs to your king!

371
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,880
并且  我将剥夺你彭德拉根的姓氏
As does the name Pendragon,which I also strip from you.

372
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,860
你无权再以此姓自称
You no longer have the right to call yourself that.

373
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,610
我也再无王姐了
And I no longer have a sister.

374
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,420
这姓氏是我与生俱来的权力
That name is my birthright.

375
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,610
你在这国家之内再无权力可言了
You have no rights in this kingdom anymore.

376
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,180
你不能剥夺我的姓氏
You will not take my name!

377
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,630
听到了吗
You hear me?!

378
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,350
亚瑟
Arthur!

379
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,770
我是彭德拉根
I am pendragon!

380
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,160
你才是无名小人
You are nothing!

381
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:06,480
你一直就只是我父亲的野种而已
You will always be nothing but my father's bastard!

382
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,300
我还没跟他告别
I never said goodbye.

383
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,610
我还没机会告诉他  他对我有多重要
I never had the chance to say how much he meant to me.

384
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,980
他生前最后一刻还在想着你
He drew his last breath thinking of you.

385
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,190
有些人我们将永生铭记
Those we hold in our hearts

386
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,550
永不言别
we never say goodbye to.

387
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,700
这一席位属于里昂提斯
This seat belongs to Leontes.

388
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,100
它将一直留空  直到我们找到
It remains empty until a champion as true and

389
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,230
像他一样忠实可敬之人
a man as honourable joins us.

390
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,750
它将永远留空
It'll remain cold for all time.

391
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,220
-同意  -同意
- Hear,hear. - Hear,hear.

392
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,530
为了里昂提斯
For Leontes.

393
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,950
为了里昂提斯
For Leontes!

394
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,130
我从未谢过你
I never thanked you.

395
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,340
经历了这一切  你居然想感谢我
After all this,you want to thank me?

396
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,430
你给了我父母  兄弟
You gave me parents and a brother,

397
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,550
他们比我自己都更爱我
all of whom loved me despite myself.

398
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,920
他们成就了今天的我
I'm more than I could ever have been,

399
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,410
现在不过才刚刚开始
and I'm only just beginning.

400
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,390
亚瑟  我要走了
Arthur... I'm leaving.

401
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,490
你不能走
You can't.

402
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,970
我必须走
I have to.

403
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,880
不  一切因你而起  你必须留下鉴证一切
No. This began with you. You stay and you see it through.

404
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,040
-代价太高昂了  -我们都付出了代价
- It's cost me too much. - It's cost all of us!

405
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:01,070
-所以我们必须继续  -让我走  亚瑟
- That's why we can't stop!  - Let me go,Arthur.

406
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,810
如果身份互换  你一定不会让我走的
If it was the other way around,you wouldn't let me go.

407
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,060
也许你比我坚强
Maybe you're stronger than me.

408
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,950
也许我以前并没意识到这点
And maybe that's what I didn't know.

409
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,510
你会回来吗
Will you come back?

410
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,410
你...
You...

411
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,090
定能成就大业
...will be great.

412
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,900
对不起
I'm sorry.

413
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,880
我现在该怎么办
What do I do now?

414
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,250
帮帮我
Help me.

415
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,390
要成为女王...
To be queen...

416
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,230
你必须...
...you must give birth...

417
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,800
诞下一位国王
...to a king.

418
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,260
我知道这样不对
I know it's wrong...

419
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,530
但我今晚无法独处
...but I don't think I can be alone tonight.

420
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,420
桂妮维尔
Guinevere...

421
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,750
就今晚而已
Just tonight.

422
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,720
他让我好好待你
He told me to treasure you.

423
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,190
照他的话做
Then do.

424
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,200
《本季终》
