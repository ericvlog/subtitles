1个
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,686
这个，它让我知道：

2个
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:22,152
许多世界被奴役
由野兽和他的军队，屠夫。

3个
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,063
这也让我知道：

4个
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,240
野兽会来到我们的世界，
克鲁尔的世界……

5个
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:35,118
他的黑色堡垒会被看到
在这片土地上...

6个
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:40,129
燃烧村庄的烟雾
会使天空变暗...

7
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:45,015
垂死者的哭声回荡
穿过荒凉的山谷。

8个
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:48,473
但有一件事我不知道：

9
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:52,182
预言是否真实...

10
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:56,397
那位古名少女
将成为女王……

11
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:02,664
她将选择一位国王，然后
他们将一起统治我们的世界......

12
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,707
还有他们的儿子
将统治银河系。

13
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:24,934
父亲！

14
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:30,401
科尔温现在应该已经到了。

15
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:34,321
他可能被迫旅行
穿过森林和石头国家。

16
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:37,501
所有的通行证和道路
由 Slayers 持有。

17
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,795
科尔温可能无法通过。

18
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:41,757
那会让你高兴吗？

19
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,302
我派人去帮忙。

20
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:47,429
但我看不出结盟的理由
与我们古老的敌人。

21
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:50,723
侵略者之父
正在摧毁我们的世界。

22
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:52,933
我们必须有联盟。

23
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:57,271
只要我们团结，
我们有机会对抗他们吗？

24
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,277
那么，我将与图罗德国王缔结条约。

25
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:03,621
没有必要
你嫁给他的儿子。

26
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,578
这是唯一的方法
保证联盟。

27
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:09,829
婚姻是我的选择。

28
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,259
如果不是 Turold 的儿子的话。

29
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,635
科尔温是一名伟大的战士。

30
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,088
好战士会成为坏丈夫。

31
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,347
也许。

32
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:03,282
骑兵逼近！

33
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:05,739
打开大门！

34
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:24,017
我们已发送给您寻求帮助。没有人来。

35
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:26,187
二十个人被派往你那里。

36
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:28,397
我们已经失去了 300 到这里。

37
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:31,894
这场婚姻不是我选择的，图罗德。

38
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:33,735
我也没有，Eirig。

39
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:38,282
我选择了它！你的女儿选择了它。
会完成的。

40
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:42,332
你将和我一起领导这支军队
对抗屠夫？

41
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,120
无论我有什么军队，
我会带头对抗他们...

42
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:48,133
直到我赢了或者我死了。

43
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,582
我选择的很好。

44
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:15,995
我也有。

45
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,053
你的旅程很艰难吗？

46
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,552
但是必要的。

47
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:27,812
- 可能已经太晚了。
- 不算太晚。

48岁
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,314
这是举行仪式的地方吗？

49
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:39,327
今晚月出。

50
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:45,828
我父亲说好战士
做坏丈夫。

51
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:48,713
- 那要看。
- 什么？

52
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:53,053
关于你是否期待丈夫
跟着你……

53
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,175
每次拍手都要跳。

54
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,011
你不为我跳吗？

55
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:02,521
不，当然不是。你是个战士。

56
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,651
从今天起，我的王国不再存在。

57
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,239
也不是我的。

58
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:43,530
我们的孩子统治下的单一王国。

59
00:09:43,945 --> 00:09:45,072
同意。

60
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,071
我给水火。

61
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,662
它不会回来，除了从手中
我选择的女人作为我的妻子。

62
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:33,344
我取水火。

63
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,600
我只给男人
我选择谁作为我的丈夫。

64
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:49,704
从我手中拿走火。

65
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,270
点名，卫兵！

66
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:12,856
- 杀手！
- 武装自己！

67
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:16,033
- 我们会一起战斗。
- 没有。有安全的出路吗？

68
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:18,611
- 地下通道。
- 快点！

69
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,305
我的位置是和你在一起。

70
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,758
- 你爱我吗？
- 我当然爱你。

71
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,883
然后去。

72
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,811
科尔温，快点回到我身边。

73
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,183
房间中央的每个人，
回来！

74
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,964
拿着！

75
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:18,025
这里！

76
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:14,011
科尔温！

77
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,306
丽莎！

78
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:22,939
科尔温！

79
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,199
科尔温！

80
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,489
父亲！

81
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:56,735
丽莎！

82
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,021
她还活着。

83
00:17:58,438 --> 00:17:59,445
在哪里？

84
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,857
别动！

85
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:02,491
在哪里？

86
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:04,870
现在，超出你的范围。

87
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,163
你是谁？

88
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,004
我是伊尼尔。

89
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:16,337
旧的。

90后
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:20,595
好吧，没有那么老。

91
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,521
你下来了
来自花岗岩山脉。

92
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:26,567
是的。现在需要我。

93
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,290
父亲！

94
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,965
现在没有时间悲伤。

95
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:57,776
你没有失去父亲
和新娘在同一天。

96
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:00,573
那天我也没有成为国王。

97
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:04,285
我没有王国。

98
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:07,660
你的王国可能更大
比你知道的。

99
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:10,627
我把它给你，老人，
欢迎来到它。

100
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:12,753
我是来找国王的...

101
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:17,719
我找到了一个男孩。

102
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:27,937
丽莎？

103
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,070
他们会把她关在黑堡垒里。

104
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,956
你能带我去吗？

105
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:42,876
你一定有帮助。

106
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,954
我会在路上找到男人。

107
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:50,755
在堡垒里，
你将面对的不仅仅是杀手。

108
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:54,544
你将面对野兽，
谁是他们的领袖。

109
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,388
他可以被杀死。

110
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,429
也许。

111
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,224
但没有人见过他并活下来。

112
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:09,976
你需要的不仅仅是人和剑。

113
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:13,692
您将需要战刃的力量。

114
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,359
战刃什么都不是
而是一个古老的符号。

115
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,161
它并不真正存在。

116
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,457
它存在，在那里。

117
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,827
最高峰的一处山洞内。

118
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:40,213
没有战刃，
你永远无法到达Lyssa。

119
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:43,255
我需要武器，而不是符号。

120
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:46,549
曾经，战刃是
一种非常强大的武器。

121
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,555
它可以再次如此。

122
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:53,091
但只有在合适的人的手中。

123
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:57,598
只为对的人
可以取回战刃。

124
00:20:58,303 --> 00:20:59,513
我是那个男人吗？

125
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,976
我希望我知道。

126
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,605
我不能和你一起去。

127
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:11,525
不用担心。如果它在那里，
我会回来的。

128
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,859
如果你不带着它回来...

129
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,034
你根本不会回来。

130
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:02,610
你被带到这里是为了结婚。

131
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,824
我是你会选择的国王。

132
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:25,251
除非你需要它，否则不要使用它。

133
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:29,086
- 我怎么知道什么时候？
- 你会知道的。

134
00:27:30,964 --> 00:27:34,060
如果你带我去黑堡垒，
我会尽快使用它。

135
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,935
那可没那么容易。

136
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:39,556
每次日出时，黑色堡垒都会移动。

137
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:42,686
有时在山上，
有时在沙漠...

138
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:44,355
“有时在海里。”

139
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:47,481
从来没有同一个地方两次。

140
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,194
但是你告诉我你知道在哪里可以找到它！

141
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,904
有王者之德
除了勇敢。

142
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:57,538
礼貌就是其中之一。

143
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:02,412
对不起。

144
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:08,915
那是莱莎的想法。

145
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:17,297
我也是，小时候...

146
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:19,756
一次。

147
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:24,843
我也像你一样爱过。

148
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:29,648
但你的爱会...

149
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:32,438
比我幸运。

150
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:38,279
我告诉你的是我知道
怎么找到堡垒...

151
00:28:38,353 --> 00:28:42,612
那就是寻求异象
盲人翡翠先知。

152
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:46,494
但他的位置也不为人知。

153
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:49,914
我知道。
从这里出发需要一天的路程。来。

154
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:36,701
帮助！

155
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:42,203
帮助！我快淹死了！

156
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,374
这可能是流沙！

157
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:52,172
我可能已经被吸死了
当你站在那里发呆时！

158
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,595
这个地方在哪？

159
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,638
花岗岩山脉附近的森林。

160
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:04,303
爆破！偏离航线 1,000 英里。

161
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:06,266
我很着急。

162
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:11,058
有意见分歧
关于醋栗派。

163
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:14,651
那人把它留在他的窗台上。

164
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,273
- 他期望什么？
- 也许他想吃掉它。

165
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:24,651
对于那种粗鲁，笨蛋，
我想我会把你变成一只蝙蝠。

166
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:30,865
可能会教你一些礼仪
倒挂一两个小时。

167
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:34,325
山民缺乏造成伤害的力量。

168
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,164
我们会看到的，老人。
我们会看到的！

169
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:42,756
不，那是热软糖酱的配方。

170
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,593
它必须是一只鹅。

171
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,594
又胖又丑。

172
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:57,849
很胖。非常难看。

173
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:10,692
从那，你知道我能做些什么
如果我是一个报复心重的人。

174
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:18,412
你现在可以离开我了。

175
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:21,992
亲爱的，亲爱的。现在让我看看...

176
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:34,762
森林并不安全。
你最好和我们一起旅行！

177
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:39,175
我，陪你去旅行？
你知道我是谁吗？

178
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:40,549
不。

179
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,681
我是伟大的埃尔戈。
个子矮，力气大。。。

180
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:49,727
目标狭窄，视野开阔。

181
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:53,684
而且我不和农民一起旅行
和乞丐。再见。

182
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:23,219
等待！等等我！

183
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,505
我刚想起来
我有这方面的紧急任务。

184
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:28,879
什么生意？

185
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:32,387
活着。

186
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:09,834
我会让你走
在这些墙内的任何地方。

187
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:16,132
因为这是你的宫殿
将统治这个世界和无数其他人。

188
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:22,804
你逃不过我。
你将成为我的女王。

189
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:47,324
老头子，你不太会选路。

190
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,577
这样可以节省我们半天的路程。

191
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:18,560
强盗。

192
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:22,272
他们是男人，我们还不知道
他们是否是强盗。

193
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:25,362
脸那么丑
只能属于强盗。

194
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:28,103
不用担心。我要把他们都变成猪。

195
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,091
你被100个人包围了！

196
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:56,055
100个不够！

197
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:02,183
我们这里有什么？斗士！

198
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:07,346
此外，你还缺少大约 90 个人。

199
00:35:07,428 --> 00:35:09,764
让我们杀死他们并完成它。

200
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:14,081
温柔，鲁恩！我不杀人
没有充分的理由。

201
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:17,650
我也没有。为此心存感激。

202
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:25,964
你是逃犯。

203
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:31,372
每个人。奴隶、强盗、
战士和争吵者。

204
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:33,776
绝望的男人。

205
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:36,658
- 就像你所看到的一样绝望。
- 好的。

206
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:39,825
那些是我需要的人。

207
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,408
你需要？

208
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:47,041
好吧，看，这些人
除了我，别跟着任何人……

209
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:49,504
我根本不跟随任何人。

210
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:53,464
- 你会跟随国王吗？
- 国王？

211
00:35:54,673 --> 00:35:58,895
有很多疯子在游荡
自称是国王的国家。

212
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:04,563
你会跟随国王吗
去黑堡垒？

213
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:06,770
现在我知道你是个疯子。

214
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,436
我不会跟随我自己的父亲
到黑堡垒。

215
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,617
- 如果他能找到的话！
——他不会那么傻。

216
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,405
捍卫你的世界是愚蠢的吗？
为你的家园和家人而战？

217
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:19,500
如果侵略者征服，
你将成为我们其他人的奴隶。

218
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:22,337
高尚的情操，但我们为利益而战。

219
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:26,290
- 你知道我的意思？
- 利润的自由。和名气。

220
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:28,583
自由？但我们有。

221
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,596
和名望，它是一个空钱包。

222
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,257
算了吧，破产了……

223
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:38,053
吃吧，饿了……

224
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:40,146
寻找它然后发疯。

225
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,106
那是真实的。

226
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:46,602
但这种名声和这种自由
你可以留给你的儿子。

227
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:57,790
你怎么知道我有儿子的？

228
00:36:57,863 --> 00:37:02,004
如果屠夫征服了克鲁尔，
你的儿子将永远被奴役。

229
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:07,670
我没有儿子，但我会和你一起去。

230
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:12,632
这个男孩让你们都感到羞耻。

231
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:30,440
只有国王和元帅
有这些手铐的钥匙。

232
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:33,828
- 你看起来不像元帅。
- 不。

233
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:38,124
你看起来适龄
成为图罗德的儿子。

234
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:39,995
确切的年龄。

235
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:44,665
Torquil，你变老了。
你的大脑软化了。

236
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,751
像你这样的九个人抵得上一支军队。

237
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:06,309
如果我们成功了，解锁它们。
否则，我会和他们一起死。

238
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:12,320
好吧，你听到他了！我们现在是军队！

239
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,829
一支没有报酬的军队。

240
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,492
你有问题吗，鲁恩？

241
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,868
一个人甚至不能自言自语
不被打扰？

242
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:21,165
我们走吧！

243
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:24,420
- 一起来！
- 能诺格！移动！

244
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,352
醋栗！

245
00:39:02,868 --> 00:39:03,878
因此！

246
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,421
伊尼尔，救命！

247
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:36,704
可怕！有
那边有个可怕的生物。

248
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:39,787
而那边，
只有一只眼睛的生物。

249
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:41,953
一只眼睛？ '一个独眼巨人。

250
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:44,413
他正把长矛对准我。

251
00:39:44,997 --> 00:39:49,006
如果是这样，你现在已经死了。
他的目标是杀手……

252
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:52,132
因为他们有着古老的仇恨
它们之间。

253
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,719
很久以前，他的祖先住
在远离克鲁尔的世界。

254
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:02,562
并且有...

255
00:40:03,557 --> 00:40:06,108
两只眼睛和其他男人一样。

256
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:11,363
然后他们和野兽做了一笔交易
谁是杀戮者的领袖。

257
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,034
他们放弃了一只眼睛
以换取力量……

258
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:19,123
展望未来。
但是他们被骗了。

259
00:40:20,658 --> 00:40:23,671
为了唯一的未来
他们被允许看到...

260
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:26,465
是他们自己死亡的时间。

261
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:31,261
他们是悲伤的、孤独的生物，
生来就知道...

262
00:40:33,255 --> 00:40:35,011
他们死去的那一天。

263
00:40:35,757 --> 00:40:38,971
今天本来是我的一天，
如果不是他的话。

264
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:40,894
上你去

265
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:52,536
我们三个继续。
其余的将留在这里。

266
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,791
我们四个继续。我不会留下
与这些罪犯！

267
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,709
我们四个人去。

268
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:17,801
他带领我们
朝向坚硬的岩石表面。

269
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,646
这个人的脑壳里有葡萄干。

270
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,519
我认识一个老朋友。

271
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:52,510
疯狂的。他们都疯了！

272
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:07,091
我们寻找黑色堡垒。

273
00:43:09,293 --> 00:43:13,090
这样的愿景会遭到反对。
谁寻求它？

274
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:14,936
新国王。

275
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:17,519
用苍老的声音？

276
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:19,981
你知道那个声音吗？

277
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,444
是的我的朋友。

278
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,822
我们正在努力寻找...

279
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,033
我会为你寻找堡垒。

280
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:17,665
- 有糖球吗？
- 不。

281
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,116
- Gumdrops？
- 不。

282
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,296
你是个什么样的男孩？
男孩子总是有糖果。

283
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:26,794
我有一个肉桂棒。

284
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:32,676
分享和分享。

285
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:36,725
我是伟大的埃尔戈。

286
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:41,898
个子矮，力气大，
目标狭窄，视野开阔。

287
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:43,985
这是非常令人印象深刻的。

288
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:45,811
我希望如此。

289
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,021
我是蒂奇。

290
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:50,034
这并不令人印象深刻，但足够了。

291
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:40,335
黑色要塞。

292
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:43,966
它在哪里？

293
00:46:01,556 --> 00:46:03,028
你没事儿吧？

294
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:04,852
是的。

295
00:46:06,186 --> 00:46:10,659
野兽不喜欢
好奇的先知窥探他的事务。

296
00:46:11,483 --> 00:46:14,580
他的力量太大了
为你克服？

297
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:19,288
是的。这里。但是有一个地方
他的力量无法到达的地方。

298
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:21,583
翡翠寺。

299
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,043
是的。在那个地方，
他不能反对我的愿景。

300
00:46:25,748 --> 00:46:27,220
你会和我们一起去那里旅行吗？

301
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:31,191
它在大沼泽中：
险恶之地。

302
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:34,535
我们的需要很大。

303
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:12,478
神庙位于沼泽的中心，
三棵树长成一棵。

304
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:16,405
那个地方怎么能长出什么东西来？
它闻起来有死亡的味道。

305
00:47:16,477 --> 00:47:18,945
死亡和权力是近亲。

306
00:47:19,355 --> 00:47:21,988
老头子，别以为我喜欢你的亲戚。

307
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:40,248
看一看。

308
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:42,379
此行之利。

309
00:47:44,502 --> 00:47:46,222
他们值一大笔钱。

310
00:47:48,963 --> 00:47:51,466
或许。给某人
谁非常近视。

311
00:47:51,757 --> 00:47:52,765
什么？

312
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:57,772
但它们是祖母绿。

313
00:47:58,054 --> 00:47:59,810
嘿，鲁恩，祖母绿。

314
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:02,185
我发誓！它们是祖母绿！

315
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:11,116
我们口袋里的石头和墓碑
在我们头顶之上就是我们将从中得到的一切。

316
00:48:44,177 --> 00:48:45,518
杀手！

317
00:48:46,096 --> 00:48:47,981
- 来自湖边！
- 掩护！

318
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:50,149
- 在这里！
- 下来。

319
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:56,198
下去吧！

320
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:07,250
快，那边！

321
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,430
科尔温！

322
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:26,848
在这里！

323
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:40,782
这是第二次
你救了我的命。

324
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:43,828
- 我是尔格。
- 壮丽的。

325
00:50:49,868 --> 00:50:51,458
他没有名字吗？

326
00:50:51,745 --> 00:50:53,298
他的名字叫雷尔。

327
00:50:53,455 --> 00:50:57,049
他有时会拜访先知。
他话不多。

328
00:50:57,125 --> 00:51:01,384
所以我注意到了。除了讽刺
给希望成为朋友的人。

329
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:04,974
或者和那些人开玩笑
谁已经是他的朋友了。

330
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:10,814
我的名字不是开玩笑，豆杆。很高兴
如果你有 20 英尺高，请起个短名字...

331
00:51:10,928 --> 00:51:14,226
但小人物需要大名字
给他们重量。

332
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:20,273
我的朋友，你的行为会给你带来重量。
我看到你从矛中救了那个男孩。

333
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:23,526
这才是朋友该有的样子
为彼此做。

334
00:51:23,773 --> 00:51:24,983
这么。

335
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:27,486
你已经和我们在一起很长一段时间了。

336
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,666
从一开始。当我学会
那个老头已经下来了……

337
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,992
我知道时机已到。

338
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:38,121
那就加入我们吧。所有男人都需要陪伴。

339
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:39,996
是的。

340
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:42,503
所有人。

341
00:51:53,716 --> 00:51:54,926
那样。

342
00:51:57,259 --> 00:52:01,186
如果我有我的愿望，
我会马上离开这个阴暗的地方。

343
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:06,396
如果我真的如愿以偿，我会
坐在醋栗派上……

344
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:08,481
大如山。

345
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:12,239
不，这有点贪心。
我会满足于一个像房子一样大的。

346
00:52:12,315 --> 00:52:13,952
我想要一只小狗。

347
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:18,076
只有一只小狗？如果你愿意，
为什么不希望 100.7

348
00:52:18,362 --> 00:52:19,404
我只想要一个。

349
00:52:19,487 --> 00:52:23,828
这是一个愚蠢的愿望。
而你，瑞尔，你想要什么？

350
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,327
无知。

351
00:52:57,103 --> 00:52:58,028
不！

352
00:53:33,259 --> 00:53:34,552
.Nennog！
- 帮助！

353
00:53:34,635 --> 00:53:35,809
帮助他！

354
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:37,642
地面。它正在下沉！

355
00:53:37,721 --> 00:53:40,022
这是野兽的力量。

356
00:53:40,307 --> 00:53:43,605
- 衔接！做链条！
- 帮助！放我出去！

357
00:53:43,685 --> 00:53:45,322
鲁恩，抓住他！

358
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:47,730
匆忙！

359
00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:58,531
- 不挂断！
- 拉！

360
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:02,920
给我斧头！

361
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:06,879
这里！

362
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:10,835
拉！

363
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,552
拉！

364
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:23,939
我滑倒了！

365
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:26,646
拉它！

366
00:54:35,479 --> 00:54:36,570
门诺！

367
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:42,527
帮我！

368
00:54:52,077 --> 00:54:53,667
放我出去！帮我！

369
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:10,103
门诺！保持静止！不要挣扎！

370
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:13,847
坚持，稍等！

371
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:15,187
抵达！

372
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,562
别动，门诺！

373
00:55:18,641 --> 00:55:20,194
不要挣扎！

374
00:55:24,229 --> 00:55:25,237
拉！

375
00:55:40,535 --> 00:55:41,746
门诺！

376
00:56:17,483 --> 00:56:19,287
是你吗，蒂奇？

377
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:40,796
- 到圣殿有多远？
- 现在不远了。

378
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:47,183
留在这里，确保
我们没有被跟踪。

379
00:56:47,259 --> 00:56:49,596
- 我会留下来。
- 当心。

380
00:56:59,395 --> 00:57:00,688
谢谢你。

381
00:57:02,939 --> 00:57:05,620
我会带领先知。蒂奇，你继续。

382
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:07,912
谢谢你，兄弟。

383
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,962
我会带领先知。你
继续Titch。

384
00:57:45,434 --> 00:57:46,940
- 这边走？
- 不。

385
00:57:49,062 --> 00:57:50,273
你确定？

386
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:54,910
我认得这棵树。

387
00:57:59,404 --> 00:58:01,456
我现在认得那个地方了。

388
00:58:38,063 --> 00:58:40,114
我们看到树了，兄弟。

389
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:43,403
寻求知识的人
必须带领我。

390
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:46,237
其他人不得靠近。

391
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:32,746
这是您寻求的知识。

392
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:13,192
野兽有很多武器。
这是其中之一。

393
01:00:15,854 --> 01:00:17,326
换生灵。

394
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:23,747
你怎么知道？

395
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,620
我在流沙中找到了先知的尸体。

396
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:33,005
他为我们献出了生命。

397
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:35,799
他是我唯一的家人。

398
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,510
我们现在是你的家人。

399
01:00:54,972 --> 01:00:57,689
现在我们没有办法
找到黑色堡垒。

400
01:00:58,434 --> 01:01:00,208
有人可能会提供帮助。

401
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:03,776
谁？

402
01:01:04,693 --> 01:01:06,282
网络寡妇。

403
01:01:06,653 --> 01:01:10,165
那个生物帮不了任何人。
去那里的人都没有回来。

404
01:01:10,365 --> 01:01:13,379
- 她有强大的力量。
- 是的，杀人。

405
01:01:14,202 --> 01:01:18,960
她可能不会杀我，因为我知道她的名字。

406
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,096
她的名字叫死神。

407
01:01:23,128 --> 01:01:28,016
她曾经有过另一个名字。
一个古老而强大的名字。

408
01:01:36,142 --> 01:01:40,948
在这段旅程中，我们都冒着生命危险。
我的风险并不比你大。

409
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,411
我必须试试。

410
01:02:22,648 --> 01:02:24,202
我的论文在哪里？

411
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:29,287
爆炸，我真的必须组织起来
这些日子中的一天。

412
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:50,523
小狗！

413
01:03:02,523 --> 01:03:04,113
尔格在哪里？

414
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,367
他很快就会回来。

415
01:04:06,881 --> 01:04:09,135
从这里开始，我独自前行。

416
01:04:09,759 --> 01:04:11,645
- 我和你一起去。
- 不。

417
01:04:13,304 --> 01:04:16,898
如果两个方法，
她肯定会杀了他们。

418
01:04:18,017 --> 01:04:19,738
一个人，我可能还有机会。

419
01:04:19,811 --> 01:04:21,947
每个人都有自己的命运，科尔温。

420
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:23,691
是的。

421
01:04:25,984 --> 01:04:28,831
是的，每个人都有自己的命运。

422
01:04:38,747 --> 01:04:41,547
如果我早上还没回来...

423
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,514
你会知道我的。

424
01:04:48,382 --> 01:04:49,853
我们留在这里。

425
01:05:09,654 --> 01:05:12,288
我仍然说这是一个愚蠢的愿望。

426
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,627
我们没有食物，
男人们太累了，无法打猎。

427
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,886
- 嘿，基根。
- 你好。

428
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:31,179
不是你的一个妻子吗
住在这附近的村子里？

429
01:05:32,552 --> 01:05:37,108
洛娜。不，她搬到了河边。

430
01:05:37,474 --> 01:05:39,776
他有几个老婆？

431
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:42,445
最后一数，大概有七八个人。

432
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:44,991
你看，他是个旅行家。

433
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,411
他涵盖了很多领域。

434
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,113
优点。

435
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,336
她住在一个村庄
在巨树的边缘。

436
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,452
她会做饭吗？

437
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,548
这不是她的强项，
但是听着，我告诉你。

438
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:03,921
只要让她带上食物就行了。
宏伟估计他会做饭。

439
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,592
我们很快就会看到。

440
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:40,171
如果你还饿的话还有很多。

441
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:42,418
别挡我的路。让我开始吧。

442
01:06:58,183 --> 01:07:00,318
- 出色地？
- 嗯，什么？

443
01:07:01,103 --> 01:07:02,739
那女孩是谁？

444
01:07:02,938 --> 01:07:06,485
她的村庄被烧毁了。
她无处可去，所以我收留了她。

445
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,284
再看她一眼，
我会把她扔出去！

446
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:12,079
值得！哦，我的宝贝。

447
01:07:12,781 --> 01:07:15,082
她对你不屑一顾。

448
01:07:15,158 --> 01:07:17,295
- 她甚至都不漂亮。
- 是的？

449
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:21,006
现在，看，花瓣，
“忠实”是我的中间名。

450
01:07:26,754 --> 01:07:28,474
你必须吃点东西。

451
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,352
我不饿。

452
01:07:31,592 --> 01:07:34,273
请为我

453
01:07:37,932 --> 01:07:39,225
谢谢你。

454
01:08:50,216 --> 01:08:51,936
你有什么烦恼？

455
01:08:53,051 --> 01:08:57,274
你选择了一个微不足道的王国
在一个微不足道的星球上。

456
01:08:57,681 --> 01:08:58,891
和爱。

457
01:08:59,099 --> 01:09:00,606
爱情转瞬即逝。

458
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:02,441
力量是永恒的。

459
01:09:16,326 --> 01:09:17,998
这就是我的力量。

460
01:09:19,245 --> 01:09:20,882
它可以是你的。

461
01:09:21,164 --> 01:09:23,501
我不要你的力量。

462
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,640
不要让我的形式吓到你。

463
01:09:27,754 --> 01:09:28,846
丽莎。

464
01:09:32,133 --> 01:09:37,353
我可以采取任何我想要的形式。
任何你想要的形式。

465
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:41,811
没有那种形式的爱。

466
01:09:47,023 --> 01:09:50,156
你认为有爱
在你的男孩国王？

467
01:09:54,031 --> 01:09:56,997
我没有把男人抱在怀里
自从爱人离开。

468
01:09:57,076 --> 01:09:58,334
这是个谎言！

469
01:09:58,411 --> 01:10:00,997
我知道这有多痛苦
远离你的爱人。

470
01:10:01,081 --> 01:10:02,503
他会背叛你。

471
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:04,420
安慰我一晚。

472
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:05,841
他不会。

473
01:10:05,918 --> 01:10:07,639
我不能背叛我的新娘。

474
01:10:07,879 --> 01:10:09,386
然后他会死。

475
01:10:09,464 --> 01:10:10,970
让我安慰你。

476
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:14,473
当她没有时，我无法接受安慰。

477
01:10:16,387 --> 01:10:17,859
那你不会吗？

478
01:10:18,306 --> 01:10:19,517
我不能。

479
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:28,198
我师傅说：
“让他背叛她，否则，杀了他。”

480
01:10:29,817 --> 01:10:35,952
是的，他是我的主人。这些爪子
离你的喉咙只有一个心跳。

481
01:10:36,491 --> 01:10:38,877
我本可以立刻杀了你。

482
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:42,799
但是，在我认识你的那一刻，我爱上了你。

483
01:10:43,624 --> 01:10:45,546
背叛的是你。

484
01:10:46,043 --> 01:10:49,803
权力转瞬即逝。
爱是永恒的。

485
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,102
记住账号。

486
01:10:57,888 --> 01:11:02,729
考虑一下这种力量。
如果你同意做我的女王...

487
01:11:03,645 --> 01:11:06,195
我会阻止屠夫的攻击。

488
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:10,283
这是在你的权力
停止杀戮和燃烧。

489
01:11:11,277 --> 01:11:15,287
你每耽误一个小时，
更多无辜的人将被杀害。

490
01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:18,082
考虑一下。

491
01:11:19,911 --> 01:11:21,299
快点，科尔温。

492
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:00,164
我要找寡妇！

493
01:12:03,873 --> 01:12:06,377
进入这里然后死去。

494
01:13:52,234 --> 01:13:53,528
丽莎！

495
01:13:54,613 --> 01:13:55,906
丽莎！

496
01:13:59,827 --> 01:14:01,665
谁说出这个名字？

497
01:14:01,745 --> 01:14:03,833
是我，茵尼尔！

498
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,180
这次我给你。

499
01:16:38,324 --> 01:16:39,415
丽莎。

500
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:45,276
当我最后一次听到这个名字时，我还很年轻。

501
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:48,688
上次跟你说这话的时候我还很年轻。

502
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:54,975
我的脸和我的名字一样美丽。

503
01:16:55,512 --> 01:17:00,254
我全心全意地爱着你，丽莎。

504
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:03,020
但你不会留在我身边。

505
01:17:04,101 --> 01:17:07,711
- 有责任，职责......
- 野心。

506
01:17:11,852 --> 01:17:14,079
你有一个儿子。

507
01:17:17,422 --> 01:17:19,603
我们有一个儿子。

508
01:17:20,482 --> 01:17:22,578
但你什么也没说。

509
01:17:25,635 --> 01:17:26,851
他在哪里？

510
01:17:27,478 --> 01:17:30,076
他一出生我就杀了他。

511
01:17:32,003 --> 01:17:34,649
而这就是我的惩罚。

512
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:37,743
我的儿子？

513
01:17:40,716 --> 01:17:45,995
既然杀不了你，
我的愤怒需要一个牺牲品。

514
01:17:53,227 --> 01:17:55,618
我知道你永远无法原谅我。

515
01:17:57,259 --> 01:18:01,287
我无法原谅自己。
我已经原谅你了。

516
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:05,898
你永远不能原谅一个女人
谁杀了你的儿子。

517
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:09,541
如果我没有...

518
01:18:10,878 --> 01:18:14,442
我现在能像当时看到你那样看到你吗？

519
01:18:16,703 --> 01:18:20,066
并让我看透你的眼睛。

520
01:18:38,872 --> 01:18:41,565
我怎么可能离开你？

521
01:18:42,518 --> 01:18:44,579
你的远见是你给我的礼物。

522
01:18:49,013 --> 01:18:51,576
你的远见可能是你给我的礼物。

523
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:56,688
- 我能为你看什么？
- 黑色堡垒，它从哪里升起？

524
01:19:00,286 --> 01:19:01,549
明天...

525
01:19:02,575 --> 01:19:04,439
在钢铁沙漠。

526
01:19:05,743 --> 01:19:08,190
但知识无用，
因为你不能离开这里。

527
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:10,529
没有人能逃脱网络。

528
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,588
有一个年轻的女孩被关押
在堡垒中。

529
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:15,728
一个叫你名字的年轻女孩。

530
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:18,874
一个年轻人在找她。

531
01:19:19,904 --> 01:19:21,932
我当时的年纪...

532
01:19:23,074 --> 01:19:25,035
你我相遇。

533
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:29,854
当你我相爱。

534
01:19:33,133 --> 01:19:35,232
你的要求超出了我的能力范围。

535
01:19:40,723 --> 01:19:42,620
它只能转动一次。

536
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:46,690
这就是网络法则。

537
01:19:47,684 --> 01:19:52,883
那么第二个莱莎将分享你的命运。
她会死去，变老和孤独。

538
01:19:53,765 --> 01:19:59,262
她将死在黑暗的地方。
这个世界将是一个黑暗的地方。

539
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:09,332
这些是我生命中的沙子。

540
01:20:12,802 --> 01:20:16,415
接受他们和蜘蛛
将无力伤害您。

541
01:20:18,672 --> 01:20:21,905
但是你自己的生命会随着沙子耗尽。

542
01:20:23,117 --> 01:20:25,014
你的生活如何？

543
01:20:26,682 --> 01:20:29,663
我把它给了以我的名字命名的女孩。

544
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:39,601
我无法阻止沙子。

545
01:20:40,765 --> 01:20:42,745
你不能停止时间。

546
01:20:47,307 --> 01:20:48,908
现在出发。

547
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,844
拯救另一个丽莎。

548
01:22:54,815 --> 01:22:57,251
日出时...

549
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,192
日出时...

550
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:08,251
黑色堡垒将出现...

551
01:23:09,257 --> 01:23:10,987
在钢铁沙漠。

552
01:23:11,693 --> 01:23:15,308
它将留在那里直到日出
第二天。

553
01:23:15,888 --> 01:23:17,070
你必须...

554
01:23:29,492 --> 01:23:31,343
你必须达到它。

555
01:23:32,431 --> 01:23:35,128
我们会达到的。你会和我们在一起。

556
01:23:36,419 --> 01:23:37,385
不。

557
01:23:40,374 --> 01:23:41,640
不，我的...

558
01:23:45,623 --> 01:23:47,810
比赛开始了。

559
01:23:51,712 --> 01:23:54,232
明智地使用你的力量。

560
01:23:55,576 --> 01:23:57,977
不要浪费它。

561
01:23:59,796 --> 01:24:03,033
我从你那里学到了力量。
我不会忘记的。

562
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:24,086
我们会把他埋在这里。

563
01:24:29,038 --> 01:24:31,823
铁沙漠距离这里 1,000 里格。

564
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:33,498
火母马。

565
01:24:33,871 --> 01:24:36,823
火母马可以旅行
一天 1,000 里格。

566
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,530
如果我们行动迅速，还有时间。

567
01:26:48,516 --> 01:26:50,438
就是这样。赶他们回去！

568
01:26:53,855 --> 01:26:55,577
灰色是领导者！

569
01:27:26,306 --> 01:27:27,566
抓住他！

570
01:27:40,405 --> 01:27:41,877
快点！快点！

571
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,518
我有你。

572
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:07,323
温柔如婴儿！

573
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:11,901
- 快给其他人装鞍！
- 正确的！

574
01:28:22,993 --> 01:28:26,341
快点。静止不动！
站住，你这个野兽！

575
01:28:38,637 --> 01:28:40,606
好好照顾他。

576
01:28:41,889 --> 01:28:44,773
- 他为什么不来？
- 他该死了。

577
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:48,149
如果他无论如何都要死，
他为什么不和我们一起去？

578
01:28:48,313 --> 01:28:51,363
不行，他必须留在这里认命。

579
01:28:51,819 --> 01:28:55,448
如果他反对，
他会给自己带来巨大的痛苦。

580
01:28:59,117 --> 01:29:01,502
稳定的！我必须留在这里。

581
01:29:02,245 --> 01:29:03,585
是时候了吗？

582
01:29:07,417 --> 01:29:10,098
你已经做得够多了，瑞尔。留在这儿。

583
01:29:12,214 --> 01:29:13,887
每个人都有自己的命运。

584
01:29:16,095 --> 01:29:17,767
每个人都有自己的命运。

585
01:29:18,555 --> 01:29:20,858
雷尔，我会和你一起骑。

586
01:29:21,348 --> 01:29:23,436
我必须留在这里，我的朋友。

587
01:29:26,605 --> 01:29:28,160
我们没有时间。

588
01:30:12,572 --> 01:30:13,745
坚持，稍等！

589
01:32:23,173 --> 01:32:24,384
在那里！

590
01:32:24,507 --> 01:32:27,972
是的，只有疯子才会想要
接近它。

591
01:32:28,553 --> 01:32:30,559
我们会更接近。

592
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,691
而且很快。天快亮了。

593
01:32:32,932 --> 01:32:35,615
我们必须进去
在双胞胎太阳升起之前。

594
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:31,783
润，回来！

595
01:34:45,534 --> 01:34:46,830
我错了。

596
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:49,672
这次旅行是值得的。

597
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:52,216
完成它...

598
01:35:10,732 --> 01:35:12,949
- 我们得赶他们走。
- 不，等等！

599
01:35:13,692 --> 01:35:15,912
我们一搬家就会被接走。

600
01:35:22,411 --> 01:35:23,647
科尔温，看。

601
01:35:57,931 --> 01:35:59,058
跟着他！

602
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:46,740
快点！

603
01:36:52,746 --> 01:36:54,585
凯根！小心男孩！

604
01:37:01,214 --> 01:37:02,804
让你的斧头开场！

605
01:37:02,882 --> 01:37:04,270
这是没有用的。

606
01:37:09,766 --> 01:37:11,107
这是我的时间。

607
01:38:16,637 --> 01:38:17,811
继续移动！

608
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,044
哪一条路？

609
01:38:46,338 --> 01:38:47,465
当心！

610
01:38:59,062 --> 01:39:02,657
- 我旅行的日子结束了，我的朋友。
- 我们会带你离开这里。

611
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,907
这是我住的地方。

612
01:39:23,507 --> 01:39:24,681
领先。

613
01:39:52,124 --> 01:39:53,548
我抱不住他！

614
01:39:58,464 --> 01:39:59,852
给我们一根绳子！

615
01:40:08,602 --> 01:40:09,646
杀手！

616
01:40:10,062 --> 01:40:11,355
我要下去。

617
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,404
去！

618
01:40:18,738 --> 01:40:19,830
回来！

619
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:21,876
- 出来！
- 不，等等！

620
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:24,288
我们无能为力。出去！

621
01:41:20,228 --> 01:41:22,234
从这里开始，我必须独自前行。

622
01:41:23,315 --> 01:41:26,198
去哪里？没有办法进去。

623
01:41:28,612 --> 01:41:30,285
有一种方法。

624
01:42:24,095 --> 01:42:26,481
我们必须找到其他人，埃尔戈。

625
01:43:35,554 --> 01:43:36,896
他们已经停止了。

626
01:43:43,897 --> 01:43:45,534
巴道夫，放手！

627
01:43:48,903 --> 01:43:49,995
当心！

628
01:44:36,501 --> 01:44:37,925
'丽莎！ .Colwyn！

629
01:44:47,723 --> 01:44:50,060
不在这里，科尔温。他太厉害了。

630
01:44:50,767 --> 01:44:53,272
你必须在远离中心的地方与他作战。

631
01:49:10,616 --> 01:49:13,381
战刃不见了。
我没有办法和他战斗。

632
01:49:18,918 --> 01:49:21,717
科尔温，不是战刃，是你。

633
01:49:24,549 --> 01:49:26,056
不，莱莎，是我们。

634
01:49:26,801 --> 01:49:28,558
是我们他打不过。

635
01:49:28,762 --> 01:49:32,476
它不会回到我身边，除非从手中
我选择的女人作为我的妻子。

636
01:49:32,559 --> 01:49:35,359
我只给男人
我选择谁作为我的丈夫。

637
01:49:38,024 --> 01:49:39,864
从我手中拿走火。

638
01:51:17,432 --> 01:51:19,770
我们必须找到其他人。快点！

639
01:51:41,586 --> 01:51:43,389
我不会离开你的，尔格。

640
01:51:57,730 --> 01:52:00,115
- 巴道夫？
- 看，这边！

641
01:52:05,156 --> 01:52:07,706
那是尔格。他可能还活着。

642
01:52:13,249 --> 01:52:14,542
我们离开这里吧。

643
01:52:14,625 --> 01:52:16,382
他冒着生命危险来拯救我们。

644
01:52:16,461 --> 01:52:19,890
我们不能把他留在这里
如果他还有机会活着的话。

645
01:52:46,663 --> 01:52:49,297
来吧，让我们带你离开这里。

646
01:54:13,015 --> 01:54:14,356
退后！

647
01:54:48,264 --> 01:54:49,652
扶他们下来！

648
01:56:36,475 --> 01:56:37,983
他会没事的。

649
01:56:39,563 --> 01:56:41,650
- 你是他的王后？
- 是的。

650
01:56:42,149 --> 01:56:43,870
- 那么我们赢了。
- 是的。

651
01:56:44,694 --> 01:56:47,909
好家伙！我应该坚持小狗！

652
01:56:50,993 --> 01:56:52,120
我认为...

653
01:56:53,578 --> 01:56:56,083
是时候解开那些手铐了。

654
01:57:03,465 --> 01:57:06,812
我以为我会保留它们
作为我们旅途的纪念。

655
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:09,819
钥匙是你的。

656
01:57:10,182 --> 01:57:13,113
只有国王和他的元帅大人
携带这把钥匙。

657
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:14,980
这是正确的。

658
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:27,040
一个古名的女孩将成为女王。

659
01:57:27,452 --> 01:57:32,210
她将选择一位国王，
他们将共同统治我们的世界……

660
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:36,575
他们的儿子将统治银河系。


1
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,686
This, it was given me to know:

2
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:22,152
That many worlds have been enslaved
by the Beast and his army, the Slayers.

3
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,063
And this, too, was given me to know:

4
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,240
That the Beast would come to our world,
the world of Krull...

5
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:35,118
and his Black Fortress would be seen
in the land...

6
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:40,129
that the smoke of burning villages
would darken the sky...

7
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:45,015
and the cries of the dying echo
through deserted valleys.

8
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:48,473
But one thing I cannot know:

9
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:52,182
Whether the prophecy be true...

10
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:56,397
that a girl of ancient name
shall become queen...

11
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:02,664
that she shall choose a king, and that
together they shall rule our world...

12
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,707
and that their son
shall rule the galaxy.

13
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:24,934
Father!

14
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:30,401
Colwyn should have been here by now.

15
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:34,321
He may be forced to travel
through the forests and the stone country.

16
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:37,501
All the passes and the roads
are held by the Slayers.

17
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,795
Colwyn may not get through.

18
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:41,757
That would please you?

19
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,302
I sent men to help.

20
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:47,429
But I see no reason for an alliance
with our ancient enemies.

21
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:50,723
Father, the invaders
are destroying our world.

22
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:52,933
We must have the alliance.

23
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:57,271
Only if we're united,
do we stand a chance against them.

24
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,277
Then, I'll make a treaty with King Turold.

25
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:03,621
It's not necessary for
you to marry his son.

26
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,578
It's the only way to
guarantee the alliance.

27
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:09,829
The marriage is my choice.

28
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,259
If it were anyone but Turold's son.

29
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,635
Colwyn is a great fighter.

30
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,088
Good fighters make bad husbands.

31
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,347
Perhaps.

32
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:03,282
Horsemen approaching!

33
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:05,739
Open the gate!

34
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:24,017
We sent to you for help. None came.

35
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:26,187
Twenty men were despatched to you.

36
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:28,397
We've lost 300 getting here.

37
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:31,894
I didn't choose this marriage, Turold.

38
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:33,735
Nor did I, Eirig.

39
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:38,282
I chose it! Your daughter chose it.
It'll be done.

40
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:42,332
And you'll lead this army with mine
against the Slayers?

41
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,120
Whatever army I have,
I'll lead against them...

42
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:48,133
until I've won or I'm dead.

43
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,582
I have chosen well.

44
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:15,995
So have I.

45
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,053
Your journey was hard?

46
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,552
But necessary.

47
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:27,812
- It may already be too late.
- It's not too late.

48
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,314
Is this where the ceremony will be?

49
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:39,327
Tonight at moonrise.

50
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:45,828
My father says that good fighters
make bad husbands.

51
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:48,713
- That depends.
- On what?

52
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:53,053
On whether you expect a husband
to follow you around...

53
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,175
jump every time you clap your hands.

54
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,011
Wouldn't you jump for me?

55
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:02,521
No, of course not. You're a warrior.

56
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,651
From this day, my kingdom is no more.

57
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,239
Nor mine.

58
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:43,530
A single kingdom under our children.

59
00:09:43,945 --> 00:09:45,072
Agreed.

60
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,071
I give fire to water.

61
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,662
It will not return, except from the hand
of the woman I choose as my wife.

62
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:33,344
I take fire from water.

63
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,600
I give it only to the man
whom I choose as my husband.

64
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:49,704
Take the fire from my hand.

65
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,270
Call the roll, guards!

66
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:12,856
- Slayers!
- Arm yourselves!

67
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:16,033
- We'll fight together.
- No. Is there a safe way out?

68
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:18,611
- An underground passage.
- Come on!

69
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,305
My place is with you.

70
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,758
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

71
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,883
Then go.

72
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,811
Colwyn, hurry back to me.

73
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,183
Everyone in the centre of the room,
get back!

74
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,964
Take it!

75
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:18,025
Here!

76
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:14,011
Colwyn!

77
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,306
Lyssa!

78
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:22,939
Colwyn!

79
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,199
Colwyn!

80
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,489
Father!

81
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:56,735
Lyssa!

82
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,021
She's alive.

83
00:17:58,438 --> 00:17:59,445
Where?

84
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,857
Stay still!

85
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:02,491
Where?

86
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:04,870
For now, beyond your reach.

87
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,163
Who are you?

88
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,004
I am Ynyr.

89
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:16,337
The old one.

90
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:20,595
Well, not as old as all that.

91
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,521
You've come down
from the Granite Mountains.

92
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:26,567
Yes. I am needed now.

93
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:43,290
Father!

94
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,965
There's no time now for grief.

95
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:57,776
You haven't lost a father
and a bride on the same day.

96
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:00,573
Nor have I become king on that day.

97
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:04,285
I have no kingdom.

98
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:07,660
Your kingdom may be greater
than you know.

99
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:10,627
I give it to you, old man,
and welcome to it.

100
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:12,753
I came to find a king...

101
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:17,719
and I find a boy instead.

102
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:27,937
Lyssa?

103
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,070
They will hold her in the Black Fortress.

104
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,956
Can you lead me to it?

105
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:42,876
You must have help.

106
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,954
I'll find men on the way.

107
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:50,755
In the Fortress,
you will face more than the Slayers.

108
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:54,544
You will face the Beast,
who is their leader.

109
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,388
He can be killed.

110
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,429
Perhaps.

111
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,224
But no man has ever seen him and lived.

112
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:09,976
You will need more than men and swords.

113
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:13,692
You will need the power of the Glaive.

114
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,359
The Glaive is nothing
but an ancient symbol.

115
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,161
It doesn't really exist.

116
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,457
It exists, up there.

117
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,827
In a cave on the highest peak.

118
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:40,213
Without the Glaive,
you will never be able to reach Lyssa.

119
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:43,255
I need weapons, not symbols.

120
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:46,549
Once, the Glaive was
a very powerful weapon.

121
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,555
It can be so again.

122
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:53,091
But only in the hands of the right man.

123
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:57,598
For only the right man
can retrieve the Glaive.

124
00:20:58,303 --> 00:20:59,513
Am I that man?

125
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,976
I wish I knew.

126
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,605
I cannot go with you.

127
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:11,525
Don't worry. If it's there,
I'll come back with it.

128
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,859
If you do not come back with it...

129
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,034
you'll not come back at all.

130
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:02,610
You have been brought here for a marriage.

131
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,824
I am the king you will choose.

132
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:25,251
Do not use it until you need it.

133
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:29,086
- How will I know when?
- You'll know.

134
00:27:30,964 --> 00:27:34,060
If you lead me to the Black Fortress,
I'll use it soon enough.

135
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,935
That will not be so easy.

136
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:39,556
At each sunrise, the Black Fortress moves.

137
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:42,686
Sometimes it is in the mountains,
sometimes in the desert...

138
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:44,355
"sometimes in the sea."

139
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:47,481
Never the same place twice.

140
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,194
But you told me you knew where to find it!

141
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,904
There are kingly virtues
other than bravery.

142
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:57,538
Courtesy is one of them.

143
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:02,412
I'm sorry.

144
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:08,915
It's the thought of Lyssa there.

145
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:17,297
I, too, was young...

146
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:19,756
once.

147
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:24,843
I, too, loved as you do.

148
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:29,648
But your love will be...

149
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:32,438
luckier than mine.

150
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:38,279
What I told you is that I knew
how to find the Fortress...

151
00:28:38,353 --> 00:28:42,612
and that is by seeking the vision
of the blind Emerald Seer.

152
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:46,494
But his place isn't known either.

153
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:49,914
It is known to me.
It is a day's journey from here. Come.

154
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:36,701
Help!

155
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:42,203
Help! I'm drowning!

156
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,374
This might have been quicksand!

157
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:52,172
I might have been sucked to my death
while you stood there gawking!

158
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,595
Where is this place?

159
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,638
The forest near the Granite Mountains.

160
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:04,303
Blast! 1,000 miles off course.

161
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:06,266
I was rushed.

162
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:11,058
There was a difference of opinion
concerning a gooseberry pie.

163
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:14,651
The man left it sitting on his windowsill.

164
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,273
- What did he expect?
- Perhaps he expected to eat it.

165
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:24,651
For that rudeness, lout,
I think I'll turn you into a bat.

166
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:30,865
Might teach you some manners
to hang upside down for an hour or two.

167
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:34,325
The Hill People lack the power to do harm.

168
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,164
We shall see about that, old man.
We'll see about that!

169
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:42,756
No, that's a recipe for hot fudge sauce.

170
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,593
It'll have to be a goose.

171
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,594
Fat and ugly.

172
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:57,849
Very fat. Very ugly.

173
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:10,692
From that, you see what I could've done
to you if I were a vengeful man.

174
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:18,412
You may leave me now.

175
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:21,992
Dear, dear. Let me see now...

176
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:34,762
The forest is not safe.
You'd best travel with us!

177
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:39,175
Me, travel with you?
Do you know who I am?

178
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:40,549
No.

179
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,681
I am Ergo the Magnificent.
Short in stature, tall in power...

180
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:49,727
narrow of purpose and wide of vision.

181
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:53,684
And I do not travel with peasants
and beggars. Goodbye.

182
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:23,219
Wait! Wait for me!

183
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,505
I've just remembered
I have urgent business in this direction.

184
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:28,879
What business?

185
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:32,387
Staying alive.

186
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:09,834
I will allow you to go
wherever you please within these walls.

187
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:16,132
For this is the palace from which you
will rule this world and countless others.

188
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:22,804
You cannot escape me.
You will be my queen.

189
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:47,324
You're no great chooser of roads, old man.

190
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,577
This way will save us half a day's travel.

191
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:18,560
Robbers.

192
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:22,272
They're men, we don't know yet
whether they're robbers.

193
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:25,362
Faces that ugly
could only belong to robbers.

194
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:28,103
Don't worry. I'll turn them all into pigs.

195
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,091
You're surrounded by 100 men!

196
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:56,055
100 is not enough!

197
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:02,183
What have we here? A fighter!

198
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:07,346
Besides, you're short about 90 men.

199
00:35:07,428 --> 00:35:09,764
Let's just kill them and be done with it.

200
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:14,081
Soft, Rhun! I don't kill men
without good reason.

201
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:17,650
Nor do I. And be thankful for it.

202
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:25,964
You're escaped prisoners.

203
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:31,372
Every one. Slaves, bandits,
fighters and brawlers.

204
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:33,776
Desperate men.

205
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:36,658
- As desperate as you'll ever see.
- Good.

206
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:39,825
Those are the kind of men I need.

207
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,408
You need?

208
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:47,041
Well, see, these men
follow no man but me...

209
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:49,504
and I follow no man at all.

210
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:53,464
- Would you follow a king?
- A king?

211
00:35:54,673 --> 00:35:58,895
There are many lunatics wandering
through the country claiming to be kings.

212
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:04,563
Would you follow a king
to the Black Fortress?

213
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:06,770
Now I know you're a lunatic.

214
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,436
I wouldn't follow my own father
to the Black Fortress.

215
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,617
- If he could find it!
- He wouldn't be so foolish.

216
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,405
Is it foolish to defend your world?
To fight for your homes and families?

217
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:19,500
If the invaders conquer,
you'll be slaves with the rest of us.

218
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:22,337
Noble sentiments, but we fight for profit.

219
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:26,290
- You know what I mean?
- The profit's freedom. And fame.

220
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:28,583
Freedom? But we have it.

221
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:32,596
And fame, it's an empty purse.

222
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,257
Count it, go broke...

223
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:38,053
eat it, go hungry...

224
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:40,146
seek it and go mad.

225
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,106
That is true.

226
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:46,602
But this fame and this freedom
you could leave to your sons.

227
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:57,790
How did you know I had sons?

228
00:36:57,863 --> 00:37:02,004
If the Slayers conquer Krull,
your sons will be enslaved forever.

229
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:07,670
I have no sons, but I will go with you.

230
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:12,632
The boy shames you all.

231
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:30,440
Only the king and the lord marshal
have the keys to these manacles.

232
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:33,828
- You don't look like a lord marshal.
- No.

233
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:38,124
You look about the right age
to be Turold's son.

234
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:39,995
The exact age.

235
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:44,665
Torquil, you're growing old.
Your brain's softening.

236
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,751
Nine men like you are worth an army.

237
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:06,309
If we succeed, unlock them.
Otherwise, I'll die with them.

238
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:12,320
Well, you heard him! We're now an army!

239
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,829
An unpaid army.

240
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,492
You got a problem, Rhun?

241
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,868
Can't a man even talk to himself
without being interrupted?

242
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:21,165
Let's go!

243
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:24,420
- Come along!
- Nennog! Move!

244
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,352
Gooseberries!

245
00:39:02,868 --> 00:39:03,878
Ergo!

246
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,421
Ynyr, help!

247
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:36,704
Horrible! There was
a terrible creature over there.

248
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:39,787
And over there,
a creature with only one eye.

249
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:41,953
One eye? 'A cyclops.

250
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:44,413
He was aiming a spear straight at me.

251
00:39:44,997 --> 00:39:49,006
Had it been so, you would now be dead.
He was aiming at a Slayer...

252
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:52,132
for they have ancient hatred
between them.

253
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,719
Long ago, his ancestors lived
in a world far from Krull.

254
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:02,562
And had...

255
00:40:03,557 --> 00:40:06,108
two eyes like other men.

256
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:11,363
Then they made a bargain with the Beast
who is the leader of the Slayers.

257
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,034
They gave up one of their eyes
in exchange for the power...

258
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:19,123
to see into the future.
But they were cheated.

259
00:40:20,658 --> 00:40:23,671
For the only future
they are permitted to see...

260
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:26,465
is the time of their own death.

261
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:31,261
They're sad, solitary creatures,
born to know...

262
00:40:33,255 --> 00:40:35,011
the day they will die.

263
00:40:35,757 --> 00:40:38,971
Today would have been my day,
if it hadn't been for him.

264
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:40,894
Up you go

265
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:52,536
We three will go on.
The rest will remain here.

266
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,791
We four will go on. I'm not staying behind
with these criminals!

267
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,709
We four will go.

268
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:17,801
He marches us
towards a solid face of rock.

269
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,646
The man has raisins in his braincase.

270
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,519
I recognise an old friend.

271
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:52,510
Mad. They're all mad!

272
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:07,091
We seek the Black Fortress.

273
00:43:09,293 --> 00:43:13,090
Such a vision will be opposed.
Who seeks it?

274
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:14,936
The new king.

275
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:17,519
With an old voice?

276
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:19,981
You know the voice?

277
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,444
Yes, my friend.

278
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,822
We're trying to find the...

279
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,033
I will seek the Fortress for you.

280
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:17,665
- Got any sugarballs?
- No.

281
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,116
- Gumdrops?
- No.

282
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,296
What kind of boy are you?
Boys always have candy.

283
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:26,794
I have a cinnamon bar.

284
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:32,676
Share and share alike.

285
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:36,725
I am Ergo the Magnificent.

286
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:41,898
Short in stature, tall in power,
narrow of purpose and wide of vision.

287
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:43,985
That is very impressive.

288
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:45,811
I should hope so.

289
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,021
I'm Titch.

290
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:50,034
That's not impressive, but adequate.

291
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:40,335
The Black Fortress.

292
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:43,966
Where is it?

293
00:46:01,556 --> 00:46:03,028
Are you all right?

294
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:04,852
Yes.

295
00:46:06,186 --> 00:46:10,659
The Beast does not like
curious Seers poking into his affairs.

296
00:46:11,483 --> 00:46:14,580
His power is too great
for you to overcome?

297
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:19,288
Yes. Here. But there is one place
where his power cannot reach.

298
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:21,583
The Emerald Temple.

299
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,043
Yes. In that place,
he cannot oppose my vision.

300
00:46:25,748 --> 00:46:27,220
Will you travel there with us?

301
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:31,191
It is in the Great Swamp:
A treacherous place.

302
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:34,535
Our need is great.

303
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:12,478
The Temple is at the centre of the Swamp,
where three trees grow as one.

304
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:16,405
How can anything grow in that place?
It smells of death.

305
00:47:16,477 --> 00:47:18,945
Death and power are close cousins.

306
00:47:19,355 --> 00:47:21,988
Don't think I like your relatives, old man.

307
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:40,248
Have a look.

308
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:42,379
The profit of this journey.

309
00:47:44,502 --> 00:47:46,222
They're worth a fortune.

310
00:47:48,963 --> 00:47:51,466
Maybe. To someone
who's very nearsighted.

311
00:47:51,757 --> 00:47:52,765
What?

312
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:57,772
But they were emeralds.

313
00:47:58,054 --> 00:47:59,810
Hey, Rhun, emeralds.

314
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:02,185
I swear it! They were emeralds!

315
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:11,116
Rocks in our pockets and gravestones
above our heads is all we'll get from this.

316
00:48:44,177 --> 00:48:45,518
Slayers!

317
00:48:46,096 --> 00:48:47,981
- From the lake!
- Take cover!

318
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:50,149
- Over here!
- Get down.

319
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:56,198
Get down there!

320
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:07,250
Quick, over there!

321
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,430
Colwyn!

322
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:26,848
Over here!

323
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:40,782
That's the second time
you've saved my life.

324
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:43,828
- I am Ergo.
- The Magnificent.

325
00:50:49,868 --> 00:50:51,458
Hasn't he got a name?

326
00:50:51,745 --> 00:50:53,298
His name is Rell.

327
00:50:53,455 --> 00:50:57,049
He visits the Seer sometimes.
He doesn't speak much.

328
00:50:57,125 --> 00:51:01,384
So I've noticed. Except to be sarcastic
to people who wish to be friends.

329
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:04,974
Or jest with those
who already are his friends.

330
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:10,814
My name is no jest, beanpole. It's nice to
have a short name if you're 20 feet tall...

331
00:51:10,928 --> 00:51:14,226
but small people need large names
to give them weight.

332
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:20,273
Your actions give you weight, my friend.
I saw you save the boy from a spear.

333
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:23,526
That's what friends are supposed
to do for each other.

334
00:51:23,773 --> 00:51:24,983
Quite so.

335
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:27,486
You've been with us for a long way now.

336
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,666
Since the beginning. When I learned
that the Old One had come down...

337
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,992
I knew that the time had come.

338
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:38,121
Join us, then. All men need company.

339
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:39,996
Yes.

340
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:42,503
All men.

341
00:51:53,716 --> 00:51:54,926
That way.

342
00:51:57,259 --> 00:52:01,186
If I had my wish,
I'd be out of this gloomy place right away.

343
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:06,396
If I really had my wish, I'd be
sitting on top of a gooseberry pie...

344
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:08,481
as big as a mountain.

345
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:12,239
No, that's a bit greedy.
I'll settle for one as big as a house.

346
00:52:12,315 --> 00:52:13,952
I'd wish for a puppy.

347
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:18,076
Only one puppy? If you're wishing,
why not wish for 100.7

348
00:52:18,362 --> 00:52:19,404
I only want one.

349
00:52:19,487 --> 00:52:23,828
That's a foolish wish.
And you, Rell, what would you wish for?

350
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,327
Ignorance.

351
00:52:57,103 --> 00:52:58,028
No!

352
00:53:33,259 --> 00:53:34,552
.Nennog!
- Help!

353
00:53:34,635 --> 00:53:35,809
Help him!

354
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:37,642
The ground. It's sinking!

355
00:53:37,721 --> 00:53:40,022
It is the power of the Beast.

356
00:53:40,307 --> 00:53:43,605
- Link up! Make a chain!
- Help! Get me out!

357
00:53:43,685 --> 00:53:45,322
Rhun, get hold of him!

358
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:47,730
Hurry!

359
00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:58,531
- Hang on!
- Pull!

360
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:02,920
Give me the axe!

361
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:06,879
Here!

362
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:10,835
Pull!

363
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,552
Pull!

364
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:23,939
I'm slipping!

365
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:26,646
Pull it!

366
00:54:35,479 --> 00:54:36,570
Menno!

367
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:42,527
Help me!

368
00:54:52,077 --> 00:54:53,667
Get me out! Help me!

369
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:10,103
Menno! Keep still! Don't struggle!

370
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:13,847
Hold on!

371
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:15,187
Reach!

372
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,562
Keep still, Menno!

373
00:55:18,641 --> 00:55:20,194
Don't struggle!

374
00:55:24,229 --> 00:55:25,237
Pull!

375
00:55:40,535 --> 00:55:41,746
Menno!

376
00:56:17,483 --> 00:56:19,287
Is that you, Titch?

377
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:40,796
- How far to the Temple?
- Not far now.

378
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:47,183
Stay here, make sure
we're not being followed.

379
00:56:47,259 --> 00:56:49,596
- I will stay.
- Be careful.

380
00:56:59,395 --> 00:57:00,688
Thank you.

381
00:57:02,939 --> 00:57:05,620
I'll lead the Seer. Titch, you go ahead.

382
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:07,912
Thank you, brother.

383
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,962
I'll lead the Seer. You
go ahead with Titch.

384
00:57:45,434 --> 00:57:46,940
- This way?
- No.

385
00:57:49,062 --> 00:57:50,273
You sure?

386
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:54,910
I recognise this tree.

387
00:57:59,404 --> 00:58:01,456
I recognise the place now.

388
00:58:38,063 --> 00:58:40,114
We're in sight of the trees, brother.

389
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:43,403
He who seeks the knowledge
must lead me.

390
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:46,237
No one else may approach.

391
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:32,746
Here is the knowledge you seek.

392
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:13,192
The Beast has many weapons.
This was one of them.

393
01:00:15,854 --> 01:00:17,326
The Changeling.

394
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:23,747
How did you know?

395
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,620
I found the Seer's body in the quicksand.

396
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:33,005
He gave his life for us.

397
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:35,799
He was my only family.

398
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,510
We're your family now.

399
01:00:54,972 --> 01:00:57,689
Now we have no way
to find the Black Fortress.

400
01:00:58,434 --> 01:01:00,208
There is one who might help.

401
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:03,776
Who?

402
01:01:04,693 --> 01:01:06,282
The Widow of the Web.

403
01:01:06,653 --> 01:01:10,165
That creature helps no one.
And none who go there return.

404
01:01:10,365 --> 01:01:13,379
- She has great powers.
- Yeah, to kill.

405
01:01:14,202 --> 01:01:18,960
She may not kill me, for I know her name.

406
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,096
Her name is Death.

407
01:01:23,128 --> 01:01:28,016
She had another name once.
An ancient and powerful name.

408
01:01:36,142 --> 01:01:40,948
We all risk our lives on this journey.
My risk is no greater than yours.

409
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,411
I must try.

410
01:02:22,648 --> 01:02:24,202
Where are my papers?

411
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:29,287
Blast, I really must get organised
one of these days.

412
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:50,523
Puppy!

413
01:03:02,523 --> 01:03:04,113
Where's Ergo?

414
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,367
He'll be back soon.

415
01:04:06,881 --> 01:04:09,135
From here, I go on alone.

416
01:04:09,759 --> 01:04:11,645
- I'm going with you.
- No.

417
01:04:13,304 --> 01:04:16,898
If two approach,
she would certainly kill both.

418
01:04:18,017 --> 01:04:19,738
Alone, I may have a chance.

419
01:04:19,811 --> 01:04:21,947
Each to his fate, Colwyn.

420
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:23,691
Yeah.

421
01:04:25,984 --> 01:04:28,831
Yes, each to his fate.

422
01:04:38,747 --> 01:04:41,547
If I'm not back by morning...

423
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,514
you'll know mine.

424
01:04:48,382 --> 01:04:49,853
We stay here.

425
01:05:09,654 --> 01:05:12,288
I still say it was a foolish wish.

426
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,627
We have no food,
and the men are too tired to hunt.

427
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,886
- Hey, Kegan.
- Hello.

428
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:31,179
Doesn't one of your wives
live in a village near here?

429
01:05:32,552 --> 01:05:37,108
Lona. No, she moved down to the river.

430
01:05:37,474 --> 01:05:39,776
How many wives does he have?

431
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:42,445
About seven or eight, at the last count.

432
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:44,991
He's a travelling man, you see.

433
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,411
He covers a lot of ground.

434
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,113
Merith.

435
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,336
She lives in a village
at the edge of the giant trees.

436
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,452
Can she cook?

437
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,548
It's not her strongest point,
but hear, I tell you.

438
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:03,921
Just have her bring provisions.
Magnificence there reckons he can cook.

439
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,592
We'll soon see.

440
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:40,171
Plenty more if you're still hungry.

441
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:42,418
Out of my way. Let me get at it.

442
01:06:58,183 --> 01:07:00,318
- Well?
- Well, what?

443
01:07:01,103 --> 01:07:02,739
Who's the girl then?

444
01:07:02,938 --> 01:07:06,485
Her village was burned.
She'd nowhere to go, so I took her in.

445
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,284
Look at her one more time,
and I'll throw her out!

446
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:12,079
Merith! Oh, my sweet.

447
01:07:12,781 --> 01:07:15,082
She doesn't hold a candle to you.

448
01:07:15,158 --> 01:07:17,295
- She's not even pretty.
- Yeah?

449
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:21,006
Now, look, petal,
"faithful" is my middle name.

450
01:07:26,754 --> 01:07:28,474
You must eat something.

451
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,352
I'm not hungry.

452
01:07:31,592 --> 01:07:34,273
Please, for me.

453
01:07:37,932 --> 01:07:39,225
Thank you.

454
01:08:50,216 --> 01:08:51,936
What troubles you?

455
01:08:53,051 --> 01:08:57,274
You have chosen a paltry kingdom
on an insignificant planet.

456
01:08:57,681 --> 01:08:58,891
And love.

457
01:08:59,099 --> 01:09:00,606
Love is ﬂeeting.

458
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:02,441
Power is eternal.

459
01:09:16,326 --> 01:09:17,998
Such is my power.

460
01:09:19,245 --> 01:09:20,882
It can be yours.

461
01:09:21,164 --> 01:09:23,501
I don't want your power.

462
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,640
Do not let my form frighten you.

463
01:09:27,754 --> 01:09:28,846
Lyssa.

464
01:09:32,133 --> 01:09:37,353
I can assume any form I wish.
Any form you wish.

465
01:09:39,391 --> 01:09:41,811
There's no love in that form.

466
01:09:47,023 --> 01:09:50,156
And you think there's love
in your boy king?

467
01:09:54,031 --> 01:09:56,997
I've not held a man in my arms
since my lover left.

468
01:09:57,076 --> 01:09:58,334
This is a lie!

469
01:09:58,411 --> 01:10:00,997
I know how painful it is
to be far from your lover.

470
01:10:01,081 --> 01:10:02,503
He will betray you.

471
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:04,420
Comfort me for one night.

472
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:05,841
He will not.

473
01:10:05,918 --> 01:10:07,639
I can't betray my bride.

474
01:10:07,879 --> 01:10:09,386
Then he will die.

475
01:10:09,464 --> 01:10:10,970
Let me comfort you.

476
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:14,473
I can't accept comfort when she has none.

477
01:10:16,387 --> 01:10:17,859
You will not then?

478
01:10:18,306 --> 01:10:19,517
I cannot.

479
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:28,198
My master said:
"Make him betray her. If not, kill him."

480
01:10:29,817 --> 01:10:35,952
Yes, he is my master. These talons
were a heartbeat away from your throat.

481
01:10:36,491 --> 01:10:38,877
I could have killed you in an instant.

482
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:42,799
But, in the hour I knew you, I loved you.

483
01:10:43,624 --> 01:10:45,546
It is you who are betrayed.

484
01:10:46,043 --> 01:10:49,803
Power is fleeting.
Love is eternal.

485
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,102
Remember me.

486
01:10:57,888 --> 01:11:02,729
Consider this power.
If you consent to be my queen...

487
01:11:03,645 --> 01:11:06,195
I will halt the attacks of the Slayers.

488
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:10,283
It is in your power
to stop the killing and burning.

489
01:11:11,277 --> 01:11:15,287
Each hour you delay,
more innocent people will be killed.

490
01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:18,082
Think on it.

491
01:11:19,911 --> 01:11:21,299
Hurry, Colwyn.

492
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:00,164
I seek the Widow!

493
01:12:03,873 --> 01:12:06,377
Enter here and die.

494
01:13:52,234 --> 01:13:53,528
Lyssa!

495
01:13:54,613 --> 01:13:55,906
Lyssa!

496
01:13:59,827 --> 01:14:01,665
Who speaks that name?

497
01:14:01,745 --> 01:14:03,833
It is I, Ynyr!

498
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,180
I give you this time.

499
01:16:38,324 --> 01:16:39,415
Lyssa.

500
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:45,276
I was young when I last heard that name.

501
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:48,688
I was young when I last spoke it to you.

502
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:54,975
And my face was as beautiful as my name.

503
01:16:55,512 --> 01:17:00,254
And I loved you, Lyssa, with all my heart.

504
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:03,020
But you would not stay with me.

505
01:17:04,101 --> 01:17:07,711
- There were responsibilities, duty...
- Ambition.

506
01:17:11,852 --> 01:17:14,079
You had a son.

507
01:17:17,422 --> 01:17:19,603
We had a son.

508
01:17:20,482 --> 01:17:22,578
But you said nothing.

509
01:17:25,635 --> 01:17:26,851
Where is he?

510
01:17:27,478 --> 01:17:30,076
I killed him when he was born.

511
01:17:32,003 --> 01:17:34,649
And this is my punishment.

512
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:37,743
My son?

513
01:17:40,716 --> 01:17:45,995
Since I could not kill you,
my rage needed a victim.

514
01:17:53,227 --> 01:17:55,618
I know you can never forgive me.

515
01:17:57,259 --> 01:18:01,287
I cannot forgive myself.
I have already forgiven you.

516
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:05,898
You can never forgive a woman
who has killed your son.

517
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:09,541
If I had not...

518
01:18:10,878 --> 01:18:14,442
could I see you now as I saw you then?

519
01:18:16,703 --> 01:18:20,066
And allow me to see through your eyes.

520
01:18:38,872 --> 01:18:41,565
How could I have left you?

521
01:18:42,518 --> 01:18:44,579
Your vision is your gift to me.

522
01:18:49,013 --> 01:18:51,576
And your vision could be your gift to me.

523
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:56,688
- What can I see for you?
- The Black Fortress, where does it rise?

524
01:19:00,286 --> 01:19:01,549
Tomorrow...

525
01:19:02,575 --> 01:19:04,439
in the Iron Desert.

526
01:19:05,743 --> 01:19:08,190
But the knowledge is useless,
for you can't leave here.

527
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:10,529
No man has ever escaped the Web.

528
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,588
There is a young girl being held
in the Fortress.

529
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:15,728
A young girl with your name.

530
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:18,874
A young man seeks her.

531
01:19:19,904 --> 01:19:21,932
The age I was when...

532
01:19:23,074 --> 01:19:25,035
you and I met.

533
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:29,854
When you and I loved.

534
01:19:33,133 --> 01:19:35,232
What you ask is beyond my power.

535
01:19:40,723 --> 01:19:42,620
It can be turned only once.

536
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:46,690
That is the Law of the Web.

537
01:19:47,684 --> 01:19:52,883
Then the second Lyssa will share your fate.
She will die, grow old and lonely.

538
01:19:53,765 --> 01:19:59,262
She will die in a place of darkness.
This world will be a place of darkness.

539
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:09,332
These are the sands of my life.

540
01:20:12,802 --> 01:20:16,415
Accept them and the spider
will have no power to harm you.

541
01:20:18,672 --> 01:20:21,905
But your own life runs out with the sand.

542
01:20:23,117 --> 01:20:25,014
What about your life?

543
01:20:26,682 --> 01:20:29,663
I give it to the girl who bears my name.

544
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:39,601
I cannot stop the sand.

545
01:20:40,765 --> 01:20:42,745
You cannot stop time.

546
01:20:47,307 --> 01:20:48,908
Go now.

547
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,844
Save the other Lyssa.

548
01:22:54,815 --> 01:22:57,251
At sunrise...

549
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,192
At sunrise...

550
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:08,251
the Black Fortress will appear...

551
01:23:09,257 --> 01:23:10,987
in the Iron Desert.

552
01:23:11,693 --> 01:23:15,308
It will remain there until sunrise
of the following day.

553
01:23:15,888 --> 01:23:17,070
You must...

554
01:23:29,492 --> 01:23:31,343
You must reach it.

555
01:23:32,431 --> 01:23:35,128
We'll reach it. You'll be with us.

556
01:23:36,419 --> 01:23:37,385
No.

557
01:23:40,374 --> 01:23:41,640
No, my...

558
01:23:45,623 --> 01:23:47,810
race is run.

559
01:23:51,712 --> 01:23:54,232
Use your power wisely.

560
01:23:55,576 --> 01:23:57,977
Do not squander it.

561
01:23:59,796 --> 01:24:03,033
I learned the power from you.
I won't forget.

562
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:24,086
We'll bury him here.

563
01:24:29,038 --> 01:24:31,823
The Iron Desert's 1,000 leagues from here.

564
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:33,498
Fire mares.

565
01:24:33,871 --> 01:24:36,823
Fire mares can travel
1,000 leagues in a day.

566
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,530
There's time if we move quickly.

567
01:26:48,516 --> 01:26:50,438
That's it. Drive them back!

568
01:26:53,855 --> 01:26:55,577
The grey is the leader!

569
01:27:26,306 --> 01:27:27,566
Hold him!

570
01:27:40,405 --> 01:27:41,877
Come on! Come on!

571
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,518
I've got you.

572
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:07,323
Gentle as a baby!

573
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:11,901
- Saddle the others, quickly!
- Right!

574
01:28:22,993 --> 01:28:26,341
Come on. Hold still!
Stand still, you beast!

575
01:28:38,637 --> 01:28:40,606
Take good care of him.

576
01:28:41,889 --> 01:28:44,773
- Why doesn't he come?
- It's his time to die.

577
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:48,149
If he's going to die anyway,
why doesn't he come with us?

578
01:28:48,313 --> 01:28:51,363
No. He must stay here and accept his fate.

579
01:28:51,819 --> 01:28:55,448
If he opposes it,
he'll bring great pain on himself.

580
01:28:59,117 --> 01:29:01,502
Steady! I must remain here.

581
01:29:02,245 --> 01:29:03,585
Is it time?

582
01:29:07,417 --> 01:29:10,098
You've done enough, Rell. Stay here.

583
01:29:12,214 --> 01:29:13,887
Each to his fate.

584
01:29:16,095 --> 01:29:17,767
Each to his fate.

585
01:29:18,555 --> 01:29:20,858
Rell, I'll ride with you.

586
01:29:21,348 --> 01:29:23,436
I have to stay here, my friend.

587
01:29:26,605 --> 01:29:28,160
We had no time.

588
01:30:12,572 --> 01:30:13,745
Hold on!

589
01:32:23,173 --> 01:32:24,384
There it is!

590
01:32:24,507 --> 01:32:27,972
Yes, and only madmen would want
to get this close to it.

591
01:32:28,553 --> 01:32:30,559
We're going to get a lot closer.

592
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,691
And quickly. It's almost dawn.

593
01:32:32,932 --> 01:32:35,615
We must get inside
before the twin suns rise.

594
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:31,783
Rhun, get back!

595
01:34:45,534 --> 01:34:46,830
I was wrong.

596
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:49,672
The journey was worthwhile.

597
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:52,216
Finish it...

598
01:35:10,732 --> 01:35:12,949
- We'll have to rush them.
- No, wait!

599
01:35:13,692 --> 01:35:15,912
We'll be picked off as soon as we move.

600
01:35:22,411 --> 01:35:23,647
Colwyn, look.

601
01:35:57,931 --> 01:35:59,058
Follow him!

602
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:46,740
Come on!

603
01:36:52,746 --> 01:36:54,585
Kegan! Mind the boy!

604
01:37:01,214 --> 01:37:02,804
Get your axe in the opening!

605
01:37:02,882 --> 01:37:04,270
It's no use.

606
01:37:09,766 --> 01:37:11,107
This is my time.

607
01:38:16,637 --> 01:38:17,811
Keep moving!

608
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,044
Which way?

609
01:38:46,338 --> 01:38:47,465
Look out!

610
01:38:59,062 --> 01:39:02,657
- My travelling days are over, my friend.
- We'll get you out of here.

611
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,907
Here's where I stay.

612
01:39:23,507 --> 01:39:24,681
Lead on.

613
01:39:52,124 --> 01:39:53,548
I can't hold him!

614
01:39:58,464 --> 01:39:59,852
Throw us a rope!

615
01:40:08,602 --> 01:40:09,646
Slayers!

616
01:40:10,062 --> 01:40:11,355
I'm going down.

617
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,404
Go!

618
01:40:18,738 --> 01:40:19,830
Get back!

619
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:21,876
- Come out!
- No, wait!

620
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:24,288
There is nothing we can do. Get out!

621
01:41:20,228 --> 01:41:22,234
From here, I must go on alone.

622
01:41:23,315 --> 01:41:26,198
Go where? There's no way in.

623
01:41:28,612 --> 01:41:30,285
There is one way.

624
01:42:24,095 --> 01:42:26,481
We must find the others, Ergo.

625
01:43:35,554 --> 01:43:36,896
They've stopped.

626
01:43:43,897 --> 01:43:45,534
Bardolph, let it go!

627
01:43:48,903 --> 01:43:49,995
Look out!

628
01:44:36,501 --> 01:44:37,925
'Lyssa! .Colwyn!

629
01:44:47,723 --> 01:44:50,060
Not here, Colwyn. He's too powerful.

630
01:44:50,767 --> 01:44:53,272
You must fight him away from the centre.

631
01:49:10,616 --> 01:49:13,381
The Glaive is gone.
I have no way to fight him.

632
01:49:18,918 --> 01:49:21,717
Colwyn, it's not the Glaive, it's you.

633
01:49:24,549 --> 01:49:26,056
No, Lyssa, it's us.

634
01:49:26,801 --> 01:49:28,558
It's us he can't defeat.

635
01:49:28,762 --> 01:49:32,476
It won't return to me except from the hand
of the woman I choose as my wife.

636
01:49:32,559 --> 01:49:35,359
I give it only to the man
whom I choose as my husband.

637
01:49:38,024 --> 01:49:39,864
Take the fire from my hand.

638
01:51:17,432 --> 01:51:19,770
We have to find the others. Come on!

639
01:51:41,586 --> 01:51:43,389
I won't leave you, Ergo.

640
01:51:57,730 --> 01:52:00,115
- Bardolph?
- Look, over here!

641
01:52:05,156 --> 01:52:07,706
That's Ergo. He may still be alive.

642
01:52:13,249 --> 01:52:14,542
Let's get out of here.

643
01:52:14,625 --> 01:52:16,382
He risked his life to save us.

644
01:52:16,461 --> 01:52:19,890
We can't leave him here
if there's even a chance he's alive.

645
01:52:46,663 --> 01:52:49,297
Come on, let's get you out of here.

646
01:54:13,015 --> 01:54:14,356
Stand back!

647
01:54:48,264 --> 01:54:49,652
Help them down!

648
01:56:36,475 --> 01:56:37,983
He'll be all right.

649
01:56:39,563 --> 01:56:41,650
- You are his queen?
- Yes.

650
01:56:42,149 --> 01:56:43,870
- Then we've won.
- Yes.

651
01:56:44,694 --> 01:56:47,909
Oh, boy! I should have stuck to puppies!

652
01:56:50,993 --> 01:56:52,120
I think...

653
01:56:53,578 --> 01:56:56,083
it's time we unlocked those manacles.

654
01:57:03,465 --> 01:57:06,812
I thought I'd keep them
as a memento of our journey.

655
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:09,819
The key's yours.

656
01:57:10,182 --> 01:57:13,113
Only the king and his lord marshal
carry this key.

657
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:14,980
That's right.

658
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:27,040
A girl of ancient name shall become queen.

659
01:57:27,452 --> 01:57:32,210
She shall choose a king,
and together they shall rule our world...

660
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:36,575
and their son shall rule the galaxy.
