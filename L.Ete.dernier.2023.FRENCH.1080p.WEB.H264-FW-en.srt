1
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,950
{\an8}LAST SUMMER...

2
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:02,867
Did you drink alcohol that evening?

3
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,700
Yes.
-How many?

4
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:16,492
Two or three glasses.
-Two? Or three?

5
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,367
Three.

6
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:24,033
How many boyfriends have you had this year?

7
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:29,742
Less than ten? More than ten?

8
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,658
Less than ten.

9
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,992
And how many did you sleep with?

10
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,533
You can sleep with whoever you want.

11
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,992
As long as it was with consent,
no one will judge you.

12
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:48,450
As a minor, your hearing is closed,
but I need to know everything. How many?

13
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:52,200
Seven.

14
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,783
Is that a lot?
-That's not the point.

15
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:04,450
The opposing team will portray you as one
slut who fucks everything that comes with it.

16
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,575
And claim you agreed.

17
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:10,283
That is not true.

18
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,700
I know that.

19
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,867
That's how the defense plays it.

20
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:21,450
In court
victims often become suspects.

21
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,617
But don't worry...

22
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:47,908
...the judges are used to that
and know how to distinguish.

23
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:50,825
Whatever you hear, stay calm.

24
00:02:52,283 --> 00:02:56,075
And tell when you are interrogated
always the truth.

25
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,867
Does mom really have to be there?

26
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,700
No pictures. She is underage.

27
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:16,533
Are you satisfied with the verdict?
-We were hoping for more.

28
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,575
But at least my daughter will be
recognized as a victim.

29
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,533
We are going to process this nightmare
to recover.

30
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:39,450
Girls, isn't daddy
to the riding school with you?

31
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:43,075
Rebecca called. Théo has been arrested.

32
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:45,533
You mean it.
-As usual...

33
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,325
...can't explain anything to his mother properly,
so I prefer to go there.

34
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,033
What has he done now?
-Arguing with his math teacher.

35
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,867
He was suspended for two days,
she said...

36
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:00,325
...but now it turns out he's him
punched him in the mouth.

37
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,575
Shit.
-So he files a report.

38
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:06,492
I can just about do it
catch the train to Geneva.

39
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:08,617
Can you bring the girls?

40
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,075
Girls, come. Get in quickly.
I'll take you myself eventually.

41
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,658
Thank you.

42
00:04:22,825 --> 00:04:26,200
Théo is coming to live with us.
-That sucks.

43
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,533
Pierre wants a bond with his son,
this is the chance.

44
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,533
But he's a problem child, right?

45
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,533
Speaking of problems. Just hold on.

46
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:43,617
You take him as planned,
or you say no and I look for a babysitter.

47
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:49,242
But you're not going to mess with you
dull head as soon as it becomes too difficult for you.

48
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:51,408
Mina...
-Nothing Mina.

49
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:56,283
Come, your aunt is here.
She will be thrilled to see you.

50
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,242
Lucas.

51
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:01,950
I didn't kiss daddy.
-Go ahead.

52
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,533
I'm nervous.

53
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:14,242
My heart, a kiss here.
And a kiss there.

54
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:16,075
Come, sit down.

55
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,950
Please stay seated there.
Don't move and don't talk.

56
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:28,325
After your aunt, I have two more customers.
-Cool dragon you have.

57
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,533
Got it from daddy?
What a sweetheart, your father.

58
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,408
I'm going to put it among my treasures.

59
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,492
Shall I take him with me?
to play with the girls?

60
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,492
Then you can join us for dinner
when you come to get him.

61
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:47,450
No, but sweet of you.

62
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,700
I can't see that jerk anymore.
He doesn't understand that I work...

63
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:54,992
...even if the work is worthless.

64
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:55,783
Hello, Theo.

65
00:06:56,992 --> 00:07:00,325
Hi.
-I came to bring you things.

66
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,200
Wouldn't you like to leave them swinging?
Look, you have plenty of closet space.

67
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,575
Okay?
-Cool.

68
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:16,450
You've grown up so much.
-Yeah, that's cool.

69
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:21,575
One more year and then plea.
-Plea?

70
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,700
This is a goddamn hole.

71
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,825
Yeah, it's a bit remote for a teenager.

72
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:29,617
There's a train going. You get used to it.

73
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,533
Good...

74
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,533
But why wasn't he here?
-Because he lived with his mom.

75
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,825
Do you want also?
-Why?

76
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:48,492
That's why, Miss Why.
Because that's just how it was.

77
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:03,658
We had lunch without you.

78
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:07,908
I do not eat meat.
-Mom, I'm going to get Théo's present.

79
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:12,283
But I would like coffee.
To wake up.

80
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:20,617
Open it.

81
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:31,575
I made it at school.
For your key.

82
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,700
And I made the wrapping paper.
-Oh yeah?

83
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,450
How sweet.

84
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:44,658
Very nice. Thank you so much, Angela.

85
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:48,617
Thanks, Serena.
What beautiful paper you have made.

86
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:50,575
I understand, but...

87
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:56,825
Listen, it's unacceptable
that you train the matter this way.

88
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,408
If you take off your administrative glasses
you would agree with me.

89
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:08,367
It concerns a girl of 13
that has been waiting for centuries.

90
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:13,617
Her mother is dead, she is in a home,
far from the only parent she has left.

91
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,617
What's taking so long?

92
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,825
And now you fall.
-And yet I didn't fall.

93
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:29,367
Because I'm small.
In real life you have to fall.

94
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:31,408
Then again.

95
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,450
That was an osotogari.

96
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,492
That hurts, doesn't it?

97
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,325
I'm very good at judo.
I strangle all the boys.

98
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:57,242
Mom, we were playing.

99
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:08,158
That was amazing. What is that?
It's completely loose. Oh, no, not.

100
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:36,033
It's hell.

101
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,825
Instead of thanking me
that I give 700 people a job...

102
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:40,575
...they start nitpicking.

103
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:42,408
They don't want to understand...

104
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:46,075
...that I own the company's profit
invested in the holding company.

105
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:49,033
What was in the left pocket
went into the right pocket.

106
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,908
If you don't invest in innovation,
you will go down.

107
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:58,325
But no, what interests them is
the right pocket. The left pocket doesn't matter.

108
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:07,242
It's simple. I'm going for a tax audit
applications from the holding company and all branches.

109
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:11,408
Then they will see that I don't have a cent
stole from the tax authorities.

110
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:15,325
And then they just stop their recovery
up their asses.

111
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:25,783
Come on, it's late. We are going to sleep.
You're tired, you can't do it anymore.

112
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,158
Don't you think I'm an old fart sometimes?

113
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:14,658
Never.

114
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:22,158
Théo thinks I'm an old fart.

115
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:29,992
And he lets me know that too.

116
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:38,908
Yesterday he said I have the girls
adopted to ease my conscience.

117
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:42,075
Because I wasn't there for him.

118
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:43,950
Really and truly?

119
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:55,617
Where does he get it from?
He's a mean brat.

120
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:09,075
He says I could have been their grandfather.

121
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,158
He's not always like this.

122
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,950
He gets along well with the girls.
They're crazy about him.

123
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:18,408
In any case, that is positive.

124
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:24,158
We're just old farts to him.

125
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,742
Wouldn't you rather sleep?
You're exhausted.

126
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:15,867
When I was 14...

127
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:22,533
...I was secretly in love
to a friend of my mother's.

128
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,283
I thought it was so elegant.

129
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:35,492
And at the same time
I described in my diary...

130
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:41,033
...relentless are wrinkles.

131
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:45,658
His thin, parchment skin.

132
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:50,075
As if he were already dead.

133
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:56,575
Like he was disintegrating.

134
00:14:57,492 --> 00:14:59,658
Relentless.

135
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,992
Towards death.

136
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,242
I was disgusted.

137
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,783
And at the same time I was fascinated.

138
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:18,242
Do you know how old he was?

139
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,242
33.

140
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:27,742
I saw him as an almost-corpse.

141
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:30,617
Just think.

142
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,992
And how do you see your old man?

143
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:02,367
I'm a gerontophile, you know that.

144
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:12,283
A body that has lived and not
has more the firmness of youth...

145
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:15,617
...makes me emotional.

146
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,450
I find that moving.

147
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:52,408
I'd rather not have you smoking in the house.

148
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:07,033
And I'd rather not want this either.
-It's not hash. Be happy.

149
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:13,241
Théo, we do our best
to make you feel at home here.

150
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,700
It would be cool
if it didn't come from one side.

151
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:23,616
Okay what?
-Understood. Let me, I'm busy.

152
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:26,366
By which?
-With work.

153
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:28,450
Oh yeah? What are you working on?

154
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:32,367
Let me, I said. You distract me.

155
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:34,992
I don't believe a word of it
that you work.

156
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:38,367
You don't do anything except play games
and I know what to look at.

157
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:41,825
That's my problem. It'll be fine.

158
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:46,325
It'll be fine? What does that mean?
You have exams at the end of the year.

159
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,617
It's hell here. Get lost.

160
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:54,783
To begin...
-Give it back, dammit.

161
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,450
Who do you think you are?
That's mine. Are you crazy or something?

162
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:09,742
Here.

163
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,825
I have an hour and a half.
-Better than nothing. I never see you, Mimi.

164
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:37,450
And your stepson?
-He detests me, but that's okay.

165
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:57,408
What is this?

166
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,242
I'm going to call Pierre.

167
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:51,408
Pierre, we've been broken into.

168
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:57,617
I do not know. They're stuck
forced open the garden doors.

169
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:02,533
You should see the living room.
Yes, I'll call the police.

170
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:08,283
My bag has disappeared from the hall.

171
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:12,200
I haven't seen anything else yet.

172
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:16,492
Yes.

173
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:23,325
What is this?
-Just a moment, darling.

174
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,783
There's been a burglary.
Go in your room and see if you're missing anything.

175
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,783
Very kind, your stepson.

176
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,742
I don't exist
and that's fine for now.

177
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,992
Pierre, are you still there?

178
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,367
Thank you for coming so quickly.

179
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:51,117
I wanted to let Sara know immediately.
I have good news.

180
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:56,658
The juvenile court judge decided
that you can live with your father.

181
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:04,367
I don't know how to thank you.
-Thank the judge.

182
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:06,325
No, it's thanks to you.

183
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:11,950
Excuse me. I'm really sorry.
-Nothing wrong.

184
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:28,867
A familiar environment seemed to the judge
better after your mother's illness and death.

185
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:31,242
The rest is up to you, Mr. Evrard.

186
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:34,033
I hope that's clear.
-Certainly.

187
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,242
Youth care is watching.
Don't make me regret it.

188
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:24,075
Yes?
-Does this mean anything to you?

189
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,450
That's mine.
-I found him in the driveway...

190
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:30,950
...put it in my bag
and forgot to give it back to you.

191
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,742
No point.

192
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:44,450
My bag was stolen during the burglary.

193
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:48,450
How did that keychain come about?
in your pocket?

194
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:52,617
Are you going through my stuff now?
-Always, when I do the laundry.

195
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:54,450
I'm waiting for your explanation.

196
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,992
Don't know.
-Don't you be stupid.

197
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:01,658
Where are all the stolen items?

198
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:07,617
How so? Are you drunk?
-Burgling into your home. Nice mentality. Bravo.

199
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:10,450
But what your father thinks...

200
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:15,325
Do I tell him, or do you?
-You do it. I do not care.

201
00:23:16,158 --> 00:23:17,783
I do not believe you.

202
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:21,200
You know me poorly.

203
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,367
May be, but downward spirals,
I know where it is difficult to get out.

204
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,658
Especially someone who is known to law enforcement.

205
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:34,158
Just call the cops
I do not care.

206
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:39,367
Why always those aggressive reactions?
Listen.

207
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:45,825
Let's go for the most intelligent
go option.

208
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:49,992
I can keep quiet about your father
and leave him out...

209
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:53,283
...but...
-But what?

210
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:58,825
But I want compensation.
-Which?

211
00:23:58,992 --> 00:24:02,242
You're going to do your best
to integrate into this family.

212
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,617
Let's see if you can do that.

213
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:09,658
I see problem children every day, you know.
-I'm not a child.

214
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,950
Prove it.

215
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:36,492
What are you doing?
-I'm trying to get the beach stuff.

216
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:38,117
Wait a second.

217
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:46,117
Which one do you want?
-The swimming belts, the snorkels and...

218
00:24:46,283 --> 00:24:48,492
Swimming belt.
-And the glasses.

219
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:50,617
Snorkel, goggles.
-Thank you.

220
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:55,283
Anything else?
-No, it's okay. That pink thing too.

221
00:24:56,658 --> 00:24:59,950
Super.
-Was that it? That's five pounds.

222
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:03,117
I'm going swimming with the girls.
Would you like to come?

223
00:25:04,075 --> 00:25:05,450
Why not.

224
00:25:06,575 --> 00:25:11,408
We'll eat the salad first, girls.
-Yes, Mom, after that.

225
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:20,700
A pseudo-vegetarian.

226
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:25,450
A Big Mac is not meat.
It's too delicious.

227
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,783
Can't be resisted, that's all.

228
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,908
So you are no longer a vegetarian.
Great, I was tired of buying soy steaks.

229
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:39,325
I lasted two years.

230
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:45,283
It's cold.

231
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:49,742
Watch out, I'm going to splash you.

232
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:05,825
Look, little creatures.
-Theo. Theo, come. Theo, come back.

233
00:26:06,783 --> 00:26:10,450
We don't dare go any deeper.

234
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:14,450
Can't get in?
-I do not feel.

235
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,450
Either you integrate into the family, or...

236
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:23,450
What are you doing, Theo?

237
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,450
Stop.
-Here.

238
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:30,658
That's mine.

239
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,408
Do not.

240
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:05,492
I've dumped guys
because they held me under water...

241
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,783
You can't dump me.

242
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:36,450
You don't hold back, you know.
-Never.

243
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:45,533
And tomorrow we go horse riding.

244
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,658
Are you coming too?
-Horse riding? I can't ride a horse.

245
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,783
When did you start?

246
00:30:14,742 --> 00:30:18,408
When I was 12, with mom.
She loved it.

247
00:30:29,242 --> 00:30:31,158
Do you miss Geneva?

248
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:36,075
Geneva sucks.
The people too. All money grubbers.

249
00:30:37,575 --> 00:30:40,700
Invite who you want. You are at home.

250
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,450
I do not have friends.

251
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:49,033
Me neither.

252
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:54,742
How did you get that?
-I put that myself.

253
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:58,492
You realize you'll never be there again
comes from?

254
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:00,075
Do you realize that's bullshit?

255
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:03,742
You can have them removed straight away.
-Is that right?

256
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:09,117
You can remove them with white ink.
Or you can change them.

257
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:13,450
I can put one there, if you have the guts.
-Absolutely not.

258
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:18,242
Why not? Are you afraid?
-It's just not my thing.

259
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:22,783
You are afraid of pain. Everyone has them.
-Precisely.

260
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:33,450
Over there. I'll put one there. Really.

261
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:38,492
Or there. There yeah, come on.

262
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,575
That's chic. And I see you want it.
-Not at all.

263
00:31:44,325 --> 00:31:50,117
You are afraid of pain. It just stings
a little. You'll love it.

264
00:31:57,658 --> 00:32:01,200
Come on, just for fun. A little one there.
-No.

265
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:06,575
Yep, there. What you want.
Small, big, you can say so.

266
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,575
Over there.
-No.

267
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:14,742
Give me your arm.

268
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:23,658
Over there. I swear, here he comes.
Any other place is impossible.

269
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:27,117
If you put him there,
you will be chic for centuries.

270
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:56,450
That hurts.
-Don't show up.

271
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,325
Did you see mine?
Imagine that pain.

272
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,783
That's you.
I've never liked pain.

273
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:19,950
You really are a poser.

274
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:28,408
Because it's the first. It's addicting.
After this you'll be begging me for another one.

275
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:33,033
Then you say: Théo, get another tattoo.
-I'm sure not.

276
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,783
That is what you say now.
They all say that.

277
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,575
I'm trying.

278
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:42,283
Did Mona Lisa move constantly, do you think?

279
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:14,117
Good evening.

280
00:34:18,283 --> 00:34:20,992
My stepmother Anne.
Amanda.

281
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:24,283
Good evening, madam.

282
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,033
It happened in Hamburg.

283
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,492
Hikers saw a huge lake near it
amounts of dead toads lying around.

284
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:04,283
Really a lot.

285
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,908
Which lake?
-I don't remember the name of the lake.

286
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:13,325
Don't ask those embarrassing questions.
-I know Hamburg a little.

287
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,283
Not me.

288
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:23,950
No, a massacre. Toad massacre.
About a thousand pieces. Voila.

289
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:27,367
And how did that happen?
-Exactly, that's a mystery.

290
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,450
Was the lake polluted? Toxic?

291
00:35:30,617 --> 00:35:35,242
No, there were no dead toads
in the lake, but around it...

292
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:37,908
...and they had all exploded.

293
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:42,492
Was there an explosion in the water?
-Let him tell you.

294
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:47,867
I try to follow and understand it.
-Yes, he can ask questions.

295
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:50,492
And?
-In the first instance...

296
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:57,908
Boring shit?
-Giant.

297
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,783
I'm going to get butts. Are you coming?
-Why not.

298
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:41,117
Another?

299
00:36:54,492 --> 00:36:59,575
Tell me, Amanda
hasn't been by in days.

300
00:37:00,908 --> 00:37:03,075
It comes and it goes.

301
00:37:03,242 --> 00:37:06,450
But is she still your girlfriend?

302
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:10,492
Girlfriend?
What are you talking about?

303
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:15,783
What should I say then?
-There's nothing to say.

304
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,450
She has her life, I have mine.

305
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,700
And what about your feelings?

306
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:29,492
Feelings aren't my thing.

307
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:35,242
Okay then. I did not say anything.

308
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:42,117
And you and my father?

309
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:45,950
What, me and your dad?

310
00:37:46,325 --> 00:37:48,492
My father and you,
is that true love?

311
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:57,033
Do you really want me to tell you things?
about Pierre and me?

312
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:04,408
If I were my mother at your age
heard talk about men...

313
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,033
That made me feel sick.

314
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,158
Did she have many husbands, your mother?
-Fairly.

315
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:25,033
And you, before my father?

316
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:29,200
Everything is relative.

317
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:40,950
My mother was from the time of the pill
and the sexual revolution.

318
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:43,825
Everyone slept with everyone.

319
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,450
But not you?
-I am from the AIDS generation.

320
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:54,158
It came to an end immediately.
In one fell swoop.

321
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:58,575
Goodbye carelessness
and frivolity.

322
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:02,117
A window opened
and closed again.

323
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:08,450
But you've had plenty of men, right?

324
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:11,283
No comment.

325
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,242
I'm going.
-Amanda?

326
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,075
No comment.

327
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:49,742
Where were you? I called myself completely.

328
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:54,075
Have they left yet?
-Where were you?

329
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:58,283
I went for a walk.

330
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:10,242
We had visitors, you know.
-I felt like getting some air.

331
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:13,783
No.

332
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:22,117
You felt like making them feel
that you don't care about them.

333
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:25,575
Thank you on their behalf and on my behalf.

334
00:40:28,908 --> 00:40:34,783
Is it too much to ask you, perhaps not
cordial, but behaving normally?

335
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:41,117
You know what I think of 'normopaths'?
They bore me to death.

336
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:46,783
And they bore themselves. Please be
not a normopath, it doesn't suit you.

337
00:41:04,908 --> 00:41:11,283
Very sexy, and he says: You know about mine
special sexual relationship with women.

338
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,033
I say: Yes, I know.

339
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,450
To which he says:
I have an artistic project and...

340
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:20,367
Excuse me? An artistic project?
-Correct.

341
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:24,242
He takes his laptop
and show me pictures of him...

342
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:27,492
...making out with different women.

343
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:34,158
They are quite beautiful, but somewhat...
-That's quite a project.

344
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:41,450
Say that. And at some point
he says: I want you in this project, so...

345
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:47,700
Sorry to interrupt the outpourings.
With you I always feel like an intruder.

346
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,742
I would like to be a mouse
to know what you are saying.

347
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:55,367
Everything, down to the smallest detail.

348
00:41:55,492 --> 00:41:58,408
Girls are coarser than men,
believe me.

349
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,950
Then I'd rather not know anything.

350
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:05,992
The children have been playing like crazy for an hour
on the trampoline. Worth a look.

351
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:12,117
Well, I'll tell you more...
-Yes, tell me.

352
00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:20,117
Does not matter. Again.

353
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:46,992
Dad, come with us
play on the trampoline?

354
00:42:47,158 --> 00:42:50,450
That's not possible, darling.
I have to pack my suitcase.

355
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:54,158
When I come back,
you are two days older.

356
00:42:54,325 --> 00:42:57,158
Two days isn't much, right, honey?

357
00:43:10,325 --> 00:43:12,325
Does your mobile phone never get any rest?

358
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:18,992
It's a great sci-fi series. Not the
usual junk. Brilliant. And French.

359
00:43:19,158 --> 00:43:20,658
Would you like to see it?

360
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:45,783
That looks good.

361
00:43:47,617 --> 00:43:49,325
I love it.

362
00:46:20,325 --> 00:46:24,783
Théo, we must never do this again.
-Are you pinching him?

363
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,450
I'm not joking.

364
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:32,242
We must do
as if nothing happened and forget about it.

365
00:46:32,408 --> 00:46:35,575
And above all, never do it again.
Promise me.

366
00:46:35,742 --> 00:46:40,033
Wasn't it tasty?
-Yes. I let myself go.

367
00:46:41,325 --> 00:46:45,908
But now we're in shit.
I shouldn't have done it, believe me.

368
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,825
Relax. It's not a drama.

369
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,450
Should I promise never to do it again?
Like a little naughty boy?

370
00:46:56,575 --> 00:46:58,533
I'm not joking.

371
00:47:03,158 --> 00:47:05,575
You're really annoying.

372
00:47:20,158 --> 00:47:24,117
Locked up all day
in a gloomy convention center.

373
00:47:25,992 --> 00:47:31,450
One seminar after another.
No time to enjoy the place.

374
00:47:33,575 --> 00:47:35,492
Always the same.

375
00:47:35,658 --> 00:47:38,867
I bought a new computer
for Theo.

376
00:47:39,033 --> 00:47:43,075
Why?
-Then he's not constantly on his cell phone.

377
00:47:43,242 --> 00:47:46,075
And he can work on it.

378
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:48,408
Couldn't you have discussed that?

379
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:52,242
Is it a problem
that I bought a computer for your son?

380
00:47:52,408 --> 00:47:55,367
I might have him
want to give yourself.

381
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:04,825
Do I also have to ask permission?
if I cook for him or do his laundry?

382
00:48:09,617 --> 00:48:12,200
In any case, it's sweet of you.

383
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:28,158
What's your favorite meal, Angela?

384
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:30,283
Just one?
-Yes.

385
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,867
Mom's spaghetti bolognese.

386
00:48:36,492 --> 00:48:41,325
And if you could take one thing with you to
a desert island, what would that be?

387
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,742
Serena.
-But I'm not a thing, am I?

388
00:48:45,783 --> 00:48:49,075
And what would you take with you?
to a desert island?

389
00:48:49,242 --> 00:48:55,658
My duvet, my pillow
and my lightsaber to defend me.

390
00:48:55,825 --> 00:48:58,992
Jokkebrok. You can't sleep
without your hug.

391
00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:02,908
But if someone kills me,
what good is my cuddly toy?

392
00:49:03,075 --> 00:49:04,575
Don't know.

393
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,992
Nothing.
-Nothing. That's true.

394
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,533
Do you want a beer?

395
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:24,867
But first the dictaphone.

396
00:49:29,117 --> 00:49:31,825
Finally I will know everything about you.

397
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:35,033
You are very ambitious.

398
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:42,408
Do you swear to tell the truth?
-The truths.

399
00:49:43,408 --> 00:49:45,033
Do not cheat.

400
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:54,450
Talk.
-Aren't you supposed to ask me questions?

401
00:50:00,992 --> 00:50:02,450
Who are you?

402
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,033
You know that best.

403
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:14,450
What's best
that you have experienced?

404
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,450
Adopting the girls.

405
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:22,158
And the worst?

406
00:50:23,075 --> 00:50:26,408
Then I realised
that I couldn't have children.

407
00:50:26,533 --> 00:50:30,075
Your father and I have it
tried desperately.

408
00:50:34,742 --> 00:50:37,033
Why didn't it work?

409
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:43,867
I had an abortion when I was very young.
That didn't go well. It fucked me up.

410
00:50:55,075 --> 00:50:58,492
Who is your best friend?
-My sister.

411
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:03,617
Although she has always been very jealous of me.

412
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,283
And your biggest fear?

413
00:51:11,075 --> 00:51:12,992
All that will disappear.

414
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:20,033
Or worse, that I did everything myself
to make everything disappear.

415
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:27,617
That's my fear of heights theory.
Fear of heights is not the fear of falling...

416
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:31,450
...but fear of the uncontrollable
temptation of the fall.

417
00:51:33,408 --> 00:51:39,033
That one is so awful it's better
to jump so that fear stops.

418
00:51:44,658 --> 00:51:47,325
You are really super complicated.

419
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:53,867
What is your favorite meal?

420
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:57,700
Roquefort.

421
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:02,408
That's not a meal.
-That depends on the quantity.

422
00:52:05,367 --> 00:52:08,658
What are you taking with you?
to a desert island?

423
00:52:09,658 --> 00:52:11,450
Matchsticks.

424
00:52:13,075 --> 00:52:14,450
Smart.

425
00:52:20,992 --> 00:52:23,575
Who did you sleep with first?

426
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,867
I don't want to talk about that.

427
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:36,992
You promised to answer all questions.
-I didn't promise anything.

428
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:43,825
Come on, tell me.
-I do not feel like it.

429
00:52:48,492 --> 00:52:50,117
Why not?

430
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:56,117
There are things that never...

431
00:52:57,533 --> 00:52:59,992
...never should have happened.

432
00:53:03,492 --> 00:53:04,950
Like the two of us?

433
00:53:05,825 --> 00:53:07,575
There is no two of us.

434
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:16,075
For me, yes.
-Quiet, that scares me.

435
00:53:18,408 --> 00:53:19,867
Stop.

436
00:53:21,575 --> 00:53:26,200
I can keep a secret,
but tell me about your first time.

437
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:29,700
Girls remember them all their lives.
-Stop.

438
00:53:30,783 --> 00:53:34,408
I don't want and can't talk about it.
Too oppressive.

439
00:53:43,658 --> 00:53:45,450
What is?

440
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,575
Sorry.

441
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,033
Sorry.

442
00:54:11,408 --> 00:54:12,783
Sorry.

443
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:31,283
Am I making progress?
-Enormous.

444
00:54:36,117 --> 00:54:37,783
You're so skinny.

445
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,992
I am small.
-Quiet.

446
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,200
Hello, Sara.

447
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:08,617
I wanted to know how you are.
With you.

448
00:57:08,783 --> 00:57:10,242
It goes well.

449
00:57:10,408 --> 00:57:13,242
I have often called
but you didn't answer.

450
00:57:14,242 --> 00:57:17,200
I have another number.

451
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,283
I went to your school too...

452
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:22,533
...when I couldn't reach you.
-Sara.

453
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,117
They said you were sick.

454
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:32,200
Yes.
-What was wrong with you?

455
00:57:37,242 --> 00:57:39,992
Sara, who are you talking to?

456
00:57:40,158 --> 00:57:42,492
What did you think
from a walk?

457
00:57:42,658 --> 00:57:45,533
Would you leave, please?

458
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,367
Why?

459
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:56,533
Child protection? I'm looking for the
handler of the Evrard file.

460
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,408
Sara Evrard.

461
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,325
Thank you.

462
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:11,325
I'll come and have a look.
-Come with me.

463
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,533
Stop.

464
00:58:18,533 --> 00:58:20,617
I don't find that funny.

465
00:58:26,617 --> 00:58:28,867
This is neither the time nor the place.

466
00:58:29,867 --> 00:58:31,700
Hood with pus.

467
00:58:32,867 --> 00:58:39,117
Hello. How beautiful they are.
-We're going to open the presents.

468
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:43,033
We're going to open our presents,
Lucas.

469
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,658
No, you're not allowed to touch it.
Only me.

470
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:51,325
Is it their birthday?
-Yes.

471
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:55,867
No, it's her birthday.
-Not his?

472
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,992
Her birthday.

473
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:07,492
Lucky.

474
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,283
Leave it alone.

475
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:16,783
Mom, will you fill my gun?
-Of course, honey.

476
00:59:36,325 --> 00:59:38,617
So mean.
-Do not.

477
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,742
You're horny as hell.

478
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:47,450
Here?

479
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:52,950
You are completely...
You are completely reckless. No.

480
00:59:53,117 --> 00:59:56,700
Come on, be cool.
A quickie, just for fun.

481
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:09,033
Stay. I'll explain.
-I'm not staying here a second longer.

482
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,617
What do I say to the girls?
-That you're doing it with their brother.

483
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:26,450
congratulations Serena

484
01:00:26,575 --> 01:00:32,117
Congratulations

485
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:41,242
Mind you, it's still burning.

486
01:00:43,325 --> 01:00:45,783
I haven't gotten Champomy yet.

487
01:00:46,783 --> 01:00:49,075
Ask the Champoman.

488
01:01:17,158 --> 01:01:20,992
Do you realize that we were yesterday
but narrowly escaped disaster?

489
01:01:23,575 --> 01:01:27,742
You were super mean to me.
I just freaked out.

490
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:31,658
There is only one logical solution.

491
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:38,450
Which? Do not you want Me anymore?
-No.

492
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:44,658
We need our relationship
end immediately.

493
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,617
Are you that angry about yesterday?
-Incredibly dangerous.

494
01:01:48,783 --> 01:01:54,158
Are you going to tell daddy everything?
-Are you crazy? That would be the worst.

495
01:01:55,158 --> 01:01:59,742
This must remain secret
to keep up the appearance of a family.

496
01:02:00,742 --> 01:02:02,325
Do you realize that?

497
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:06,283
Your father should never suspect anything.

498
01:02:08,783 --> 01:02:12,867
Good.
-We won't tell him anything. To no one.

499
01:02:15,367 --> 01:02:16,950
Promise?

500
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:20,158
Promise.

501
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:34,867
I hope I can trust you.
And from today everything stops.

502
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:40,533
So you're dumping me?

503
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,575
It had to end sometime.

504
01:02:45,075 --> 01:02:47,700
You're young.
You so forgot.

505
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:52,075
And you?

506
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:57,617
That is different. You have your life
for you yet. You are free.

507
01:02:57,783 --> 01:03:01,283
You will have dozens of girls,
live your life.

508
01:03:04,825 --> 01:03:06,908
And if I don't feel like it?

509
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,283
You say that because you're young.

510
01:03:10,158 --> 01:03:12,658
Kiss Me.
-It's over, I told you, right?

511
01:03:12,825 --> 01:03:16,367
Are you denying me a kiss goodbye?
Kiss Me.

512
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:19,867
Okay, a kiss goodbye.
Then it's over.

513
01:03:23,408 --> 01:03:25,033
Farewell.

514
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:32,408
Goodbye, my love.

515
01:03:37,658 --> 01:03:42,867
You'll be jealous of my sexy
girlfriends. Then I don't need you anymore.

516
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,533
Mina called me.

517
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:16,200
What did she want?
-No idea. She didn't say anything.

518
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:33,742
I was thinking about a few days of one-on-one time
with Théo, in the chalet.

519
01:04:36,075 --> 01:04:38,992
I took a week off.

520
01:04:39,158 --> 01:04:44,075
I think he needs it
some time alone with me.

521
01:04:52,283 --> 01:04:53,658
Go ahead.

522
01:04:54,617 --> 01:04:58,950
If he still thinks afterwards
that you don't love him...

523
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:04,742
Is it a problem?

524
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:10,033
You never took time off
for the girls.

525
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,450
You think it's a bad idea.

526
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:16,533
No.

527
01:05:23,325 --> 01:05:25,242
Do you want to come along?

528
01:05:27,158 --> 01:05:31,450
I think he needs time with me.
Men among themselves.

529
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:35,242
You're probably right.

530
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:49,867
Come, let me adorn you,
like your sisters.

531
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:53,492
And she placed it on her head
a lily crown...

532
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:56,533
...of which every petal was a pearl.

533
01:05:57,575 --> 01:05:59,033
Mom?
-Yes?

534
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,533
Why couldn't we come along too?
to the chalet?

535
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:06,950
Because daddy and Théo needed it
to go together.

536
01:06:08,992 --> 01:06:12,450
What do you think they are doing?

537
01:06:12,575 --> 01:06:15,075
What we do
when we go to the chalet.

538
01:06:15,242 --> 01:06:21,325
Fishing, chopping wood, swimming,
make a fire in the garden, talk.

539
01:06:22,533 --> 01:06:25,408
Mom, keep going.
-Excuse me.

540
01:06:26,408 --> 01:06:29,575
There was a large three-master.

541
01:06:29,742 --> 01:06:33,783
The little Mermaid
swam to the ship...

542
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:40,242
...and looked through the portholes
people in beautiful evening clothes.

543
01:06:41,242 --> 01:06:46,075
The handsomest of them all was a prince...
Do you see the prince?

544
01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:49,700
...who looked barely 16 years old.

545
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:19,158
Goodbye, my love. I just wanted to know
did you arrive safely...

546
01:07:19,325 --> 01:07:24,117
...and whether you are having a good time.
The girls miss you.

547
01:07:25,283 --> 01:07:28,783
Can you call me? Kiss.

548
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:58,658
What would you take with you?
to a desert island?

549
01:08:07,325 --> 01:08:11,533
There are things that never
should never have happened.

550
01:08:14,617 --> 01:08:16,075
Like the two of us?

551
01:08:21,157 --> 01:08:24,117
Werewolves don't exist.

552
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:25,617
Yes.
-No.

553
01:08:25,782 --> 01:08:29,242
Yes, they do exist.
-Have you ever seen one?

554
01:09:20,575 --> 01:09:23,157
Bye, mom.
-Hello, Mom.

555
01:10:18,075 --> 01:10:19,742
Day.
-Day.

556
01:10:25,033 --> 01:10:28,450
Are Dad and Théo at home, do you think?
-Looks like it is.

557
01:10:31,783 --> 01:10:33,408
Dad, daddy.

558
01:10:34,408 --> 01:10:37,992
We came by taxi
from the riding school.

559
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:41,992
Mom broke the car.
-The gearbox.

560
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:46,867
I had to have it towed away.
Wouldn't you stay away for a week?

561
01:10:47,033 --> 01:10:49,075
On your lap.

562
01:10:52,408 --> 01:10:55,033
I cobbled something together.

563
01:10:56,408 --> 01:10:59,492
Where is Theo?
-He's not eating with us.

564
01:11:00,492 --> 01:11:03,533
Amanda.
-Amanda, indeed.

565
01:11:07,242 --> 01:11:10,492
You always serve me first.

566
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:13,117
Did you notice that?

567
01:11:16,242 --> 01:11:20,492
Do you know, girls,
when we arrived at the chalet...

568
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:25,367
...a mouse had gnawed through a pipe.
There was water everywhere.

569
01:11:25,492 --> 01:11:31,450
We mopped it up, looked for the hole
and we found it behind the stove.

570
01:11:31,575 --> 01:11:36,825
The stove had to be put aside. Happy
we could fix it with tape.

571
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:41,075
And the mouse?
-We sprinkled poison everywhere.

572
01:11:41,242 --> 01:11:44,325
That's so mean.
-Yes, but you know...

573
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:46,825
Sit down and eat, darling.

574
01:11:47,908 --> 01:11:52,325
Mice are cute, but they plant
move quickly and break a lot.

575
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:57,283
You can fix that.
-Yes, but you can't keep fixing things.

576
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:21,408
Don't you eat?

577
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:25,742
I'm not hungry.

578
01:12:26,533 --> 01:12:30,117
Why aren't you hungry?
-Don't know.

579
01:12:39,825 --> 01:12:41,533
Very good.

580
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:48,408
He bumps.

581
01:12:55,908 --> 01:12:58,158
Sit down, we need to talk.

582
01:13:08,575 --> 01:13:11,158
I spoke freely with Théo.

583
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,825
I said I was happy
with the chance of a life together.

584
01:13:20,825 --> 01:13:26,033
How much I like the everyday things
had missed since he was little.

585
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:32,742
Suddenly he collapsed.

586
01:13:35,033 --> 01:13:36,908
He said you guys...

587
01:13:41,158 --> 01:13:43,825
That you had an affair with my son.

588
01:13:54,825 --> 01:13:56,367
Don't you say anything?

589
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,742
That's despicable.

590
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,367
Insane.

591
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:35,242
You certainly didn't believe him, did you?

592
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,158
That miserable brat.

593
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:46,200
To come up with something so outrageous.

594
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:50,492
If you swallowed his lies,
you must have wanted that.

595
01:14:54,992 --> 01:14:57,367
I just don't know.

596
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,950
I don't know what to believe.

597
01:15:05,617 --> 01:15:08,825
Why would he say that?
if it wasn't true?

598
01:15:08,992 --> 01:15:13,325
That seems clear to me.
To get attention.

599
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,408
That's all.

600
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:21,950
Why would I want an affair?
with your son?

601
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,450
He's a child.
-Stop.

602
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,283
He told me details.

603
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,033
Details he couldn't make up.

604
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:39,117
About how... How you...

605
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:42,825
We're not done yet.
-I do.

606
01:15:44,075 --> 01:15:46,242
I swallowed so much of him.

607
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:51,367
I treated him with respect, care
and understanding, with this shit as thanks.

608
01:15:51,492 --> 01:15:54,575
And you deny the mother
of your children, your wife...

609
01:15:54,742 --> 01:16:01,117
...for the delirium of a disturbed child
that you barely know. I can't take this.

610
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:13,533
Stop. What are you doing?

611
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:16,617
He had a difficult life.

612
01:16:16,783 --> 01:16:21,742
He taught me to hate because I so-called
took his father from his mother.

613
01:16:21,908 --> 01:16:27,617
He wants to make us pay, but that is not the case
sorry for everything. And certainly not for you.

614
01:16:28,783 --> 01:16:32,783
Calm down a bit.
-Do not touch me. Never again.

615
01:16:36,283 --> 01:16:39,492
I only told
what my son said.

616
01:16:39,658 --> 01:16:44,658
Dirty lies that you swallow.
-I don't know who to believe anymore.

617
01:16:44,825 --> 01:16:46,908
Look at it from my side.

618
01:16:47,075 --> 01:16:50,117
Imagine the hell I live in
since he said that.

619
01:16:57,117 --> 01:17:00,658
Your son is a monster,
be aware of this.

620
01:17:06,575 --> 01:17:11,742
Who do you think stole our stuff?
and broke into our house?

621
01:17:15,783 --> 01:17:21,367
I didn't tell you anything. I liked that he
should be given a second chance.

622
01:17:22,617 --> 01:17:27,367
For both of you.
I always take both of you into account.

623
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:34,242
You think you are so intelligent.

624
01:17:35,658 --> 01:17:40,283
But you don't understand anything about others.
You don't understand anything.

625
01:17:46,408 --> 01:17:50,117
Can't you see what game he's playing?

626
01:17:50,283 --> 01:17:53,617
He wants you to reject me,
to have you all to themselves.

627
01:17:57,742 --> 01:18:02,325
You are so easy to manipulate.
Even a child can do that.

628
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:11,617
I'm just asking you to explain...
-What? He won, period.

629
01:19:57,533 --> 01:20:01,408
I know I don't have enough
been before you.

630
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:08,492
Not at all, in fact.

631
01:20:16,575 --> 01:20:18,408
I'm sorry.

632
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:35,325
We have to talk
about what you said in the chalet.

633
01:20:40,992 --> 01:20:43,783
What you accuse Anne of,
is serious.

634
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:53,325
No matter how angry we are, such a story
you are not allowed to invent. Do you understand?

635
01:21:05,825 --> 01:21:07,908
Do not you believe me?

636
01:21:08,075 --> 01:21:10,075
You don't lie about things like that.

637
01:21:15,242 --> 01:21:17,033
I didn't lie.

638
01:21:30,825 --> 01:21:33,242
Tell him.
-Apologize.

639
01:21:34,617 --> 01:21:37,200
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

640
01:21:40,992 --> 01:21:45,033
I understand that you are sad
and finds everything difficult.

641
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:48,158
But that...

642
01:21:49,825 --> 01:21:51,950
Why did you do that?

643
01:21:54,283 --> 01:21:56,117
You know that very well.

644
01:21:57,242 --> 01:21:59,825
No not at all.

645
01:22:04,783 --> 01:22:08,033
You're both crazy as hell.

646
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,450
We are a family.

647
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:13,325
We must be able to trust each other.

648
01:22:14,742 --> 01:22:17,783
If not, you can't come here
continue to live.

649
01:22:18,825 --> 01:22:21,658
You better give in
that you lied.

650
01:22:25,033 --> 01:22:27,575
My patience is running out, Théo.

651
01:22:39,075 --> 01:22:40,575
Speak.

652
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:58,908
Theo...

653
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:02,325
...it's not difficult.

654
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:06,200
Just say you lied.

655
01:23:07,533 --> 01:23:12,075
If you say you lied,
I am willing to let it go.

656
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,117
Stay here.

657
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,367
I do not want you to leave.

658
01:23:33,533 --> 01:23:38,242
Angela, Serena, the farewell is ready.
We have to go.

659
01:23:45,617 --> 01:23:50,033
Cheer up, girls.
We will visit Théo at school.

660
01:23:59,283 --> 01:24:01,617
Bye. Thank you.
-Bye.

661
01:24:02,783 --> 01:24:05,367
Just ask if she can receive you.

662
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:08,742
Come on.

663
01:24:16,325 --> 01:24:19,325
You have to tell Dad everything.
-I don't have to do anything.

664
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:23,908
You shouldn't have blurted it out.
Confessing is easy.

665
01:24:24,075 --> 01:24:28,450
Soothe your conscience, so to speak. Take the
responsibility for your own shit.

666
01:24:28,617 --> 01:24:32,200
And you don't have to?
-I have a family, you know.

667
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:36,617
Tell daddy I'm not lying. Otherwise...
-Otherwise?

668
01:24:38,325 --> 01:24:40,158
Otherwise I will report it.

669
01:24:47,533 --> 01:24:50,992
What exactly did I do to you?
do you think?

670
01:24:53,825 --> 01:24:55,658
So that I understand.

671
01:24:56,742 --> 01:25:00,325
You are an adult.
-And you're a child, then?

672
01:25:03,575 --> 01:25:08,825
Did I abuse you?
Did I force you to have sex with me?

673
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:13,117
That's not the point.
-Why then?

674
01:25:15,783 --> 01:25:20,325
You're twice as old as me.
You are my father's wife.

675
01:25:23,658 --> 01:25:26,033
You really are scum.

676
01:25:27,033 --> 01:25:29,408
I knew that, but that bad?

677
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:37,825
Fine.

678
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:43,533
Why would anyone believe you?

679
01:25:44,825 --> 01:25:48,575
Because it's the truth.
-No way.

680
01:25:48,742 --> 01:25:52,450
I haven't tried
to sleep with you. On the contrary.

681
01:25:52,575 --> 01:25:57,492
I shouldn't have admitted, but that
it doesn't legally make it incest.

682
01:25:57,658 --> 01:25:59,283
So what?

683
01:26:01,033 --> 01:26:04,200
Why shouldn't it be my turn?
to lie?

684
01:26:07,617 --> 01:26:10,825
Like I said, lowlife scum.

685
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,575
But fortunately it is not that simple.

686
01:26:15,742 --> 01:26:20,283
It's your word against mine
and I will sell my skin dearly.

687
01:26:22,575 --> 01:26:24,617
You have no proof.

688
01:26:24,783 --> 01:26:28,575
A pending criminal case,
a motive for revenge.

689
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,992
Besides, you're taking revenge on me.

690
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:38,533
No.
-No one will listen to you.

691
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:41,075
You are not credible.

692
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:45,867
Much easier to say your father
that you made it all up...

693
01:26:46,033 --> 01:26:48,117
...instead of being stubborn.

694
01:26:49,825 --> 01:26:54,825
You're young. You will enjoy much more
have to swallow in your life.

695
01:26:57,575 --> 01:27:02,575
You better leave this alone, you know?
I am not your enemy.

696
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,950
Hello, Sara.
-I was allowed to come and give this to you.

697
01:27:31,992 --> 01:27:34,742
How do I get flowers?
-I just wanted to thank you...

698
01:27:34,908 --> 01:27:38,492
...for everything you've done for me.
You helped me.

699
01:27:38,658 --> 01:27:43,075
How is your father?
-I have a host family until he gets better.

700
01:27:43,242 --> 01:27:45,617
They're quite nice.
-That's nice.

701
01:27:46,658 --> 01:27:48,158
Can I call you...

702
01:27:48,325 --> 01:27:51,950
...to tell you how things are going?
-Please.

703
01:27:56,117 --> 01:27:58,825
Merry Christmas, Sara.
-Merry Christmas.

704
01:28:05,908 --> 01:28:10,617
Who was that?
-That was Sara. A client.

705
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:17,033
Did she give you a bouquet of flowers?
-Yes. Nice huh?

706
01:28:18,283 --> 01:28:20,242
I'm going to put them in a vase.

707
01:28:27,075 --> 01:28:33,117
I'm so glad you came.
That's so important to me. Thank you.

708
01:28:35,825 --> 01:28:37,742
You're my sister after all.

709
01:28:38,742 --> 01:28:43,033
You know very well
that I can't stay mad at you for long.

710
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,617
Look at that.

711
01:29:08,908 --> 01:29:15,033
Look. There is a snowman
on top of. Look.

712
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:21,367
Is it too little cake?
-No, it's a little too much cocoa butter.

713
01:29:21,492 --> 01:29:26,533
I prefer chestnut cream.

714
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,658
Santa Claus has visited.

715
01:29:28,825 --> 01:29:30,908
That's impossible?

716
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,075
Yes, Santa Claus has been there.

717
01:29:38,325 --> 01:29:44,367
It's a dog. A small dog.
-What a sweetheart.

718
01:29:44,492 --> 01:29:46,117
Is this for me?
-Yes.

719
01:29:46,283 --> 01:29:48,992
That's for you.
-I don't get anything?

720
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:56,033
What is that? Why don't I get that?
-Exactly what I wanted.

721
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:00,492
What is it?
-I wonder where my...

722
01:30:00,658 --> 01:30:05,908
I don't know if this is for Angela,
or for Serena, or...

723
01:30:06,075 --> 01:30:11,242
Maybe it's for Anne.
-For me maybe?

724
01:30:11,408 --> 01:30:14,200
What does it say? Guard...

725
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:17,992
What does it say? Ah, for me.
-It says Anne.

726
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:20,575
Yes.
-Yes, young lady.

727
01:30:25,492 --> 01:30:29,158
Wait a second.
Maybe you don't like it.

728
01:30:36,367 --> 01:30:40,492
He spoiled you well.
-You are out of your mind.

729
01:30:43,992 --> 01:30:46,033
He's gorgeous.

730
01:31:20,242 --> 01:31:22,533
Mr. Farad can see you.

731
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,742
Dear colleague, per mandate
I will file a criminal case against you...

732
01:31:44,908 --> 01:31:51,533
...under 222-22-3 for serious
facts for which my client is suing you.

733
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:56,742
I would like to know what your position is
and whether you want to settle.

734
01:31:59,908 --> 01:32:06,075
I want to say that, given the situation
which I, forgive me my dear colleague...

735
01:32:06,242 --> 01:32:12,658
...know a little better than you, without completely
misrepresentation of the truth...

736
01:32:12,825 --> 01:32:16,950
...there is no reason
to quote article 222-22-3.

737
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:22,450
I want my stepson to know
that I find this blackmail abject.

738
01:32:22,575 --> 01:32:25,450
We don't ask you about your feelings.

739
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:29,158
Your client is a liar.

740
01:32:29,325 --> 01:32:31,908
His accusations
make no sense...

741
01:32:32,075 --> 01:32:35,367
...and he knows it.
-Don't address him directly.

742
01:32:35,492 --> 01:32:39,242
Please indicate if you would like
whether we continue this or not.

743
01:32:39,408 --> 01:32:43,533
If not, I will present the matter
at the Public Prosecution Service and the bar.

744
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,825
I accept your proposal.

745
01:32:50,992 --> 01:32:52,492
That's for the best.

746
01:32:53,492 --> 01:32:56,158
I won't waste your time anymore.

747
01:32:56,325 --> 01:32:59,825
Send our agreement
to my office.

748
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:01,992
Of course.

749
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:13,533
Goodbye, Theo.

750
01:34:10,658 --> 01:34:13,367
What the hell are you doing?

751
01:34:14,825 --> 01:34:16,325
See you.

752
01:34:17,367 --> 01:34:20,450
Why?
-To see you.

753
01:34:24,908 --> 01:34:27,242
We had a deal, right?

754
01:34:30,742 --> 01:34:33,283
There's no fucking deal.

755
01:34:47,242 --> 01:34:50,700
I have accepted everything.
It cost me a fortune.

756
01:34:53,533 --> 01:34:56,908
What else do you want? Torment me?

757
01:35:01,992 --> 01:35:05,700
Then see how you are doing.
You are drunk.

758
01:35:07,658 --> 01:35:12,117
You don't know what you're doing anymore.
Be reasonable.

759
01:35:23,283 --> 01:35:25,033
Stop.

760
01:36:26,617 --> 01:36:29,117
Say you're not in love with me.

761
01:36:31,033 --> 01:36:34,742
You're crazy. Completely crazy.

762
01:36:36,033 --> 01:36:37,658
You're crazy too.

763
01:36:43,117 --> 01:36:44,700
Crazy about me.

764
01:38:08,617 --> 01:38:10,242
What was it?

765
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,325
That was Theo.

766
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:18,825
He was drunk.
I called a taxi.

767
01:38:22,117 --> 01:38:23,825
You're freezing.

768
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,450
Pierre...
-Quiet.
