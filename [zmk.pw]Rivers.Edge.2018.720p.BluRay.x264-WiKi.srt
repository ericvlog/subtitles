00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,255
What happened to your teddy bear?

3
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:03,465
This?

4
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:12,474
Well, my dad bought this bear
when I was three.

5
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:17,145
Not that I remember,
that's just what my mom said.

6
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:25,362
He bought it at a rest area
when we were going on a trip.

7
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,031
I've always...

8
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:36,415
Father bought this but that's not
the reason I've kept this bear.

9
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:40,669
Stuffed animals are hard
to throw in the trash, right?

10
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,212
They have eyes!

11
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:44,756
Does she have a name?

12
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,678
Yes.

13
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,764
Ku.

14
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,308
That's all.

15
00:01:57,144 --> 00:01:59,062
She has a cute face, right?

16
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:38,643
The school...

17
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,256
Where are you?

18
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:11,760
Where are you?

19
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:56,638
Yamada?

20
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:08,275
<i>I'm the engineer on the express train</i>

21
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,027
<i>There are pretty girls at every station</i>

22
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:13,947
<i>But when you only stop for three minutes</i>

23
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:16,908
<i>There's not enough time to kiss them</i>

24
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,995
<i>-Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka</i>
-Hey.

25
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:20,912
Yes?

26
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:24,624
You know the commercial
with Riho Makise in the sea?

27
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,542
Yes.

28
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:28,670
Apparently there's a woman's face
in the water.

29
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,672
-For real?
-For real.

30
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,383
It's the ghost of a drowned woman.

31
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,135
What? For real?

32
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:37,137
-Scary, right?
-Yes!

33
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,348
Apparently you can see it
if you pause the video.

34
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,766
-No way!
-It's true.

35
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:44,811
No way! Have you seen it, Takahashi?

36
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,438
-What, me?
-Yes.

37
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:49,816
I think I saw it.

38
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,109
-For real?
-Yes.

39
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:54,404
That's terrifying.

40
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:56,114
-It is, right?
-Yes!

41
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,604
-Wakakusa.
-Yes?

42
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:36,488
Can't you smell the sea?

43
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,792
<i>There's a river in our town.</i>

44
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:53,171
<i>It's near the mouth of the river,
and the water spreads out and stagnates.</i>

45
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,339
<i>It smells bad.</i>

46
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:58,510
<i>Canada goldenrod grows near the river,</i>

47
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:01,721
<i>and you will often see dead cats
around the area.</i>

48
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:29,666
NO TRESPASSING

49
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:30,834
Pochi!

50
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,628
Where are you?

51
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:37,173
Time to go home.

52
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:39,300
Pochi!

53
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:42,512
Pochi!

54
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:44,514
Been playing?

55
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:47,267
Oh, you have something.

56
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:50,270
Did you find something good?

57
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:53,148
What did you find?

58
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:56,818
What did you find?

59
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:57,819
Right.

60
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:00,071
Come on, Pochi.

61
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,156
Time to go.

62
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:04,075
Okay, Pochi!

63
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:06,995
Okay.

64
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:08,913
Let's go home.

65
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:16,963
Rumi!

66
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,798
That's Lancôme Définicils!

67
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:20,008
Yes.

68
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,594
I got a guy to buy it for me.

69
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:25,096
I wish my boyfriend was 38!

70
00:07:25,263 --> 00:07:27,057
Ask Takahashi to buy you one.

71
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,516
Like that'll happen!

72
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,060
Yoshie!

73
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,439
Haruna! Was it all right yesterday?

74
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:37,484
<i>Ugo Ugo Ruga</i>
already ended when I got home.

75
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,694
My mom was so mad at me.

76
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:42,364
Oh, there's Kannonzaki.

77
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:43,281
What?

78
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:50,789
Morning!

79
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,969
I wonder how Kannonzaki and Haruna
are doing at the moment.

80
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:07,263
Don't ask me.

81
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,642
She keeps things to herself too much.

82
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,353
She didn't even say they were together.

83
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,939
Even though he's hot!

84
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,234
I can't stand Kannonzaki.

85
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:21,861
Haruna has no taste in guys.

86
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:27,242
-You asshole!
-It hurts.

87
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,245
-Yamada and the locker!
-What is it?

88
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:31,745
You're awful!

89
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,831
What?

90
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:35,166
How did you know?

91
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,628
-Yoshie told me.
-Takahashi?

92
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:40,755
It was terrible!

93
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:42,966
Pitch black, freezing cold...

94
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,094
-You went to help him?
-Of course, I did!

95
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,221
Do something like that again
and I'll kill you!

96
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,561
What?

97
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:56,604
Is there something between you and Yamada?

98
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:58,898
Don't be stupid!

99
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,485
It's Kanna Tajima.

100
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:05,113
Maybe she's looking for Yamada.

101
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:10,034
He's not here yet!

102
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:11,161
Hey.

103
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:12,787
-Morning.
-Morning.

104
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:15,290
Maybe the rumors aren't true.

105
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:17,750
-What?
-That Yamada's gay.

106
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:21,087
Someone saw him in Shinjuku,
holding hands with a boy.

107
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,299
And I heard he's with the freshman,
Kozue Yoshikawa.

108
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:27,218
You mean that model girl?

109
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:31,347
Apparently they went to the bushes
by the river together.

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,393
I bet you heard that from Takahashi.

111
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:38,605
Nothing he says is true.

112
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,441
Hey, that's mean!

113
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:46,988
-Stop it!
-Come to my place today.

114
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,072
Nobody's home.

115
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,911
In your dreams, dumbass!

116
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,343
Eat as much as you like.

117
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:09,969
You too, Punna.

118
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,309
Morning, Maru!

119
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:19,687
You must be sleepy.

120
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:23,816
What's the matter?

121
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:26,361
You have beautiful eyes, don't you?

122
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:59,769
Of the civil liberties,
there is freedom of conscience,

123
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:03,982
freedom of the body, and economic freedom.

124
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:10,488
Freedom of conscience means the freedom
to think and speak as you like.

125
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,409
Religious beliefs, gatherings of people,

126
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:15,868
means of expression,

127
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:20,748
learning and the likes are not
to be restricted by the state,

128
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:24,294
and individual freedom must be protected.

129
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:27,297
This principle

130
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,219
is based on the state's control
of Shinto before the war,

131
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:35,930
and its continuance is deeply cared about.

132
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:40,893
Now, freedom of expression...

133
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,020
Don't mess with me.

134
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:45,231
It means the right to give
your opinion to others...

135
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,943
<i>Please tell us your name.</i>

136
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,570
I'm Kannonzaki.

137
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:52,530
Nice to meet you.

138
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:54,949
How big is your family?

139
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:58,786
There's my dad, my mom,
my big bro, and me.

140
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,871
My close family.

141
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,706
Your close family?

142
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:05,418
My dad and mom aren't together.

143
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:10,131
I guess you could say
they don't care about each other.

144
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:12,467
She found out that he was cheating,

145
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,510
it's the same old story.

146
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:20,600
My mom got into dancing,
she did nothing else all week.

147
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,146
My dad and a woman from his office...

148
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,608
I say "woman", but she's about 45,
she's practically a granny.

149
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:33,571
They ran away together
around fall last year,

150
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:36,407
but they came back
after about a week in the end.

151
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:39,619
Things are normal now.

152
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:42,372
We all act as if nothing happened.

153
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:47,877
Does your girlfriend know
about your family?

154
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:50,463
No, I haven't talked to her about it.

155
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:51,798
Why not?

156
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:55,843
I don't think she'd be interested
in stuff like that,

157
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:59,097
and she only has her mom around,

158
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:03,142
so she might just envy me
for having two parents.

159
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:06,813
How did you two start seeing each other?

160
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,944
I guess it just felt right.

161
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:16,280
She gets really mad sometimes,

162
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:22,036
but she doesn't get too suspicious,
so she's easy to be with.

163
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,084
Keep your mouth shut!

164
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:44,809
Strip.

165
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,186
Strip what?

166
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,899
I told you to strip!

167
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:55,778
Strip!

168
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:58,197
Strip!

169
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:01,033
Strip!

170
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:02,702
Strip!

171
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,719
-Haruna's skipping class!
-I have a headache.

172
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:21,387
I'm starving.

173
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:24,640
I bet you want that gross udon again.

174
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:27,435
-It's my favorite now!
-No way!

175
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,439
It's a paper blizzard!

176
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:34,567
Wow!

177
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,651
It's amazing!

178
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:39,739
ICHIRO YAMADA

179
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,745
-Freaky! You saw it?
-I think so.

180
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,163
For real?

181
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:50,416
-Hey!
-Where's Kannonzaki?

182
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,627
-He said he's skipping this afternoon.
-Where's Yamada?

183
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:57,799
-I don't know.
-You're lying!

184
00:14:57,882 --> 00:14:59,467
What's this?

185
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:05,473
That guy's crazy.

186
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:08,893
We were just messing around.

187
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:09,977
What do you mean?

188
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:12,355
Do something.

189
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:14,899
It's something only a girlfriend can say.

190
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,692
Where's Yamada?

191
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,822
The old chemistry lab.

192
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,415
NO TRESPASSING

193
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:34,335
Yamada!

194
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,384
It's okay.

195
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,469
It's Wakakusa.

196
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:48,516
I brought your clothes. Where are you?

197
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:57,817
Over here.

198
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:22,675
Sorry, it happened again.

199
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:25,428
That's okay.

200
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,858
-Wakakusa.
-Yes?

201
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:41,444
Are you free tonight?

202
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:44,780
Yes.

203
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,494
I'll tell you about my secret treasure.

204
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,081
What?

205
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,251
I want you to see it.

206
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,674
<i>The rate of the ozone layer depletion</i>

207
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:06,552
<i>went from 5% to 10% in the last 17 years.</i>

208
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:10,722
<i>The amount of fluorocarbon released
by humans into the atmosphere</i>

209
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:13,351
<i>is 15 million tons.</i>

210
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:18,356
<i>About 10% of this, 1.5 million tons,
reaches the stratosphere,</i>

211
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,983
<i>destroying the ozone layer.</i>

212
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:28,199
MOM, I'M MEETING UP WITH A FRIEND,
THERE'S CURRY IN THE POT, HARUNA

213
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:02,900
Sorry!

214
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:12,076
It was my turn to cook dinner.

215
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:16,580
What were you like as a child?

216
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,628
When I was in elementary school,
I always go to the library.

217
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:26,007
I loved books about UFOs.

218
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:31,637
I've always wanted to see one.

219
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:34,765
I've been bullied since elementary school.

220
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,770
One day, I got beaten up badly.

221
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:46,402
My whole body was black and blue,
and I couldn't let my parents find out.

222
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:49,155
Having your parents find out is the worst.

223
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:50,906
So...

224
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:54,910
I didn't want to go home.

225
00:18:56,203 --> 00:19:01,125
I looked up at the sky from the roof
of the apartment block till it got dark.

226
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:05,463
I kept wishing for a UFO to appear.

227
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,303
I think I was up there for a few hours.

228
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:20,352
I still feel a strong desire
to see one from time to time.

229
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:23,105
It doesn't have to be a UFO.

230
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,067
I guess...

231
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:34,909
I want to see something totally
different from the reality to appear.

232
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:14,115
Hello, Koyama residence.

233
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:33,300
<i>Phone for you. Some boy named Kannonzaki.</i>

234
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,344
Okay.

235
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:37,555
<i>No more long calls.</i>

236
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,266
<i>Mom said you're costing her--</i>

237
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:41,767
Okay.

238
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,816
What is it?

239
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:52,194
What?

240
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:05,207
That was so cruel.

241
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,962
Everyone hates me.

242
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:11,505
That's not true.

243
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:15,926
I bet some of the girls like you.

244
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:18,596
They think you're cute or mysterious--

245
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,055
I'm nothing nice like that.

246
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,811
I want to gut the people
who treat me like a worm,

247
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:29,440
turn their skin inside out, salt it,
and feed it to dogs.

248
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:34,028
I want to put trash into the mouths
of the girls who watch and laugh.

249
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:37,489
That's all I ever think about.

250
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:52,922
I'm a homosexual.

251
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,431
You can call me gay, faggot,
pervert, or whatever.

252
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:09,438
But aren't you seeing Tajima from Class B?

253
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:13,984
That's just an act.

254
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:22,242
Does Tajima know that?

255
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:23,744
No.

256
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,871
It's not fair for her, really.

257
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:34,797
You're the first normal person
I've ever spoken to, Wakakusa.

258
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,369
Is it really all right?

259
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:06,704
It's okay.

260
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:10,541
My mom's at dance class,
and my dad's on a business trip.

261
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,212
Plus I'll be pissed
if we can't do it today.

262
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:20,592
So selfish.

263
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:30,060
Says the girl who came
after one phone call.

264
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:35,232
Hurry up and get it out.

265
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,091
You're kidding, a snake? No, it's not...

266
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:04,470
It's somewhere around here.

267
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:05,679
What?

268
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,569
-Here it is.
-What?

269
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:54,269
Do you do this kind of thing
with Haruna, too?

270
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:58,524
Shut up. It's none of your business.

271
00:25:10,494 --> 00:25:11,620
I found it last year.

272
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,209
I'd been beaten up like I was today.
It's embarrassing, so I came here to cry.

273
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:20,838
Then I saw this.

274
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,809
-Did you tell the police?
-I really should, but...

275
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:42,442
Around fall last year,
there was still flesh on the bone.

276
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:29,406
There we go.

277
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,343
<i>I...</i>

278
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:53,639
don't know if I'm dead or alive...

279
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:57,935
but looking at it gives me courage.

280
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:31,426
No, I'll die...

281
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:34,805
I'll die...

282
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,582
Another person knows about this.

283
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:04,793
Who?

284
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:07,045
Kozue Yoshikawa.

285
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:10,340
The freshman?

286
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:14,720
When I came at the end of last year,
she was already here.

287
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,015
Since then, we sometimes come together.

288
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:22,436
It's her treasure, too.

289
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:30,861
How long have you been doing
this kind of work?

290
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,658
Maybe since I was about three.

291
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:40,329
I wasn't a model at the start,
I was more like a child actor.

292
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:45,208
I did things like dramas
and TV commercials.

293
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,004
My parents are in that line of work,

294
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:52,883
so they asked if I wanted to try doing it.

295
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:56,678
But as for the work itself,

296
00:28:56,762 --> 00:29:01,350
everyone comes together to make one thing

297
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:04,770
which I think is great.

298
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:09,524
When you do magazine work,

299
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:13,195
you work with photographers
and all kinds of people.

300
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:16,239
And there are more brilliant people
when you do TV work.

301
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:22,371
But you'll get a sense that
it doesn't have to be you right there.

302
00:29:22,537 --> 00:29:24,373
Anyone could do it.

303
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:27,584
You think that anyone could do it?

304
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:34,466
I think I look gross when I see
a magazine or something I'm in.

305
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,514
I wonder why they keep using me
with an ugly face,

306
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,101
yet compliment me.

307
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,354
But I don't believe them.

308
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:53,777
I'm sure the truth
is that they don't really mean it,

309
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:59,449
and they're just saying
what they think they have to say.

310
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:06,665
Like they're pleased with themselves
for calling an ugly person beautiful.

311
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:11,044
<i>How is school? Do you enjoy it?</i>

312
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:15,882
<i>Compared to work, school feels genuine.</i>

313
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:17,092
<i>Genuine?</i>

314
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:24,725
I don't know if the people at school
call things as they are,

315
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:30,230
but I'm sure that if they think
something is ugly, they'll say it.

316
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:36,903
They'll at least say it behind your back.

317
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:42,325
-You mean everyone is honest?
-Yes.

318
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:52,335
How are you feeling, Yoshikawa?

319
00:30:59,134 --> 00:31:00,886
I'll go to my next class.

320
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:09,394
That won't do.
You need to have a balanced diet.

321
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:16,610
Your health comes before work.

322
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:17,986
Yes, Nurse.

323
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:47,182
So older students skip class a lot, too.

324
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,109
Do you have enough credits?

325
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:02,906
I miss school for work a lot,
so I only have just enough.

326
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,344
Oh, look.

327
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:30,350
The one who just threw the ball.

328
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,103
Running towards the center.

329
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:39,818
Yes!

330
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:43,697
That's the guy Yamada likes.

331
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:45,532
What?

332
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:49,035
That boy...

333
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:56,251
He is Yamada's other treasure.

334
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:34,581
<i>I wear my navy uniform</i>

335
00:33:35,957 --> 00:33:42,964
<i>I'm a Tokyo bus girl</i>

336
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:45,300
-Hey.
-Yes?

337
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:49,095
The old lady with makeup
from the apartment near school...

338
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:50,221
Yes?

339
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:55,852
She dries her see-through,
lace purple panties on the balcony.

340
00:33:56,853 --> 00:34:00,523
That old lady has taken the cherries
of countless boys at our school.

341
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:01,815
For real?

342
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:04,152
Why don't you ask her?

343
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:06,279
How old is she, though?

344
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:09,616
-Ask that after.
-Okay.

345
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:11,826
Oh, something's biting!

346
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:17,874
-You idiot.
-Shit!

347
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:21,711
-You were saying?
-Right.

348
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:25,048
-You know the river behind the school?
-Yes?

349
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,465
Well, there...

350
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:28,467
Excuse me!

351
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:32,013
Hey!

352
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,723
Have you heard?

353
00:34:34,057 --> 00:34:39,103
The old man died, his money is buried,
and we might...

354
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:41,563
-What are you talking about?
-So, anyway!

355
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:45,275
There's a cabin in the bushes,
near the river behind the school.

356
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,153
An old man lived there, right?

357
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,116
He was evicted and he moved
to a different apartment,

358
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,534
but he recently died.

359
00:34:53,034 --> 00:35:00,000
He was broke when he died,
but he has a lot of money stashed away!

360
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,501
Really?

361
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:05,088
And guess what!
The money is buried in the bushes!

362
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,007
-The bushes?
-Right!

363
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:10,260
Ten million in the bushes!

364
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:13,179
Isn't it amazing?

365
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:15,265
One second, I just...

366
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,519
Haruna!

367
00:35:22,897 --> 00:35:24,107
-How much is it?
-140 yen.

368
00:35:34,868 --> 00:35:37,245
Is Yoshikawa around?

369
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:38,580
Yoshikawa?

370
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:41,291
She was here earlier, but...

371
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:45,795
She often disappears.

372
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,008
What?

373
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,427
Ten million!

374
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,137
What can you do with that?

375
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,306
-Where's Haruna?
-She went off somewhere.

376
00:35:57,265 --> 00:35:58,099
Right.

377
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:00,769
I can make my dreams come true!

378
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,938
Ten million yen!

379
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,250
Why did you bring me here?

380
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,798
I'm mad at you.

381
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:31,758
Why?

382
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:37,931
Maybe I'll tell Haruna about everything.

383
00:36:38,515 --> 00:36:39,349
What?

384
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:43,728
How you tied my hands and feet,
blindfolded me,

385
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:48,233
and stuck a can of mousse
in both of my holes!

386
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:49,859
You little...

387
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:52,862
Hey!

388
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,080
I'm only kidding.

389
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,169
Hey...

390
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:10,922
Shall we do it here?

391
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:08,373
-Do you want 100 million yen?
-Yes!

392
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:12,710
-Do you want to be filthy rich?
-Yes!

393
00:39:13,044 --> 00:39:16,130
‫ !Money-‬
‫ Money-‬

394
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:18,424
-What a bunch of idiots!
‫ !Money-‬

395
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:23,888
All I said was that there might
be money buried there.

396
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:26,057
What? It's not true?

397
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,228
My mom went to the old man's funeral,

398
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:32,897
and she wondered
if he might have buried it.

399
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:33,815
What?

400
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:35,942
What about the 150 million?

401
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,611
Where did you get that from?

402
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:41,906
Is that true, Takahashi?

403
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:43,700
All right, let's go!

404
00:39:43,783 --> 00:39:46,244
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

405
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:52,458
Wait!

406
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:54,961
It's not true!

407
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:57,088
Hey!

408
00:39:57,755 --> 00:39:59,966
The money's a lie!

409
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:01,217
It's a lie!

410
00:40:01,676 --> 00:40:03,636
It's a lie! Hey!

411
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,181
It's not true! Hey!

412
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:08,933
Haruna!

413
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:13,646
Where are you going?

414
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:18,401
Those little punks.

415
00:40:20,236 --> 00:40:23,239
Hey. Where are you going?

416
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:26,200
-Come on.
-Hey.

417
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:50,224
<i>I'll tell you about my secret treasure.</i>

418
00:40:55,563 --> 00:40:56,397
Sorry.

419
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:10,203
I thought this would really suit you.

420
00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:13,748
You seem like a blue kind of guy.

421
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,918
I didn't get you anything
for your birthday.

422
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:19,420
We've only started dating in December,

423
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:21,506
and your birthday's in March.

424
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:23,883
Thank you.

425
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:27,428
Do you want to go
to the aquarium on Hakkeijima?

426
00:41:27,512 --> 00:41:29,180
I still haven't been there.

427
00:41:29,263 --> 00:41:30,348
Sure.

428
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:33,017
I'll make us lunch. When shall we go?

429
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:34,852
-What about Sunday?
-Okay.

430
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:37,605
What do you want for lunch?

431
00:41:37,688 --> 00:41:41,651
Sandwiches, rice balls, or bagels?

432
00:41:41,943 --> 00:41:42,985
Anything's fine.

433
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:47,573
Shout if you find anything! Let's go!

434
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:53,204
What are they doing?

435
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:59,669
I'm not really sure, but everyone
was saying something's buried...

436
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:01,212
Yamada?

437
00:42:02,296 --> 00:42:04,507
Hey! Stop that!

438
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,550
Yamada!

439
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:07,385
Hey!

440
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:10,596
-Yamada!
-Get off!

441
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,140
Stop it!

442
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:13,641
Stop it!

443
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:15,309
Stop!

444
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:23,860
Somebody!

445
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:25,236
Somebody!

446
00:42:45,423 --> 00:42:47,341
Who the fuck are you?

447
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:50,261
You piece of shit!

448
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:03,691
-Let's call it a day.
-We'll continue in the morning.

449
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,315
Are you okay?

450
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,422
Evening.

451
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:11,842
Evening.

452
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:13,970
This has gotten out of hand.

453
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:16,055
Right.

454
00:44:33,114 --> 00:44:33,948
Let's go.

455
00:44:54,802 --> 00:44:56,387
He went out?

456
00:44:58,472 --> 00:44:59,682
Okay.

457
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,025
Oh, my name's Tajima.

458
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:10,818
No.

459
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:17,158
Yamada got hurt, so I was worried.

460
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:22,496
Yes.

461
00:45:24,665 --> 00:45:25,833
Goodbye.

462
00:45:59,742 --> 00:46:00,826
It's fine.

463
00:46:03,454 --> 00:46:04,497
You get that end.

464
00:46:15,341 --> 00:46:16,425
Wakakusa?

465
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,844
Oh, yes.

466
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:27,603
We won't be able to look at it anymore.

467
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:29,188
We have no choice.

468
00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:32,024
I'd rather that than have them
treat it like a toy.

469
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:34,610
Ready, and lift.

470
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,658
Let's dig as deep as we can.

471
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:42,660
They'll find it if it's shallow.

472
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:44,161
Right.

473
00:47:01,053 --> 00:47:01,887
Sorry...

474
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:04,765
My arms and legs are aching.

475
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:12,106
Timeout. I need to smoke.

476
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:23,033
Give me one, Wakakusa.

477
00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:51,437
Hey...

478
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:56,025
What were you thinking when you saw it?

479
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,745
I'm not really sure.

480
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,250
I thought...

481
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:17,087
"It serves you right."

482
00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:21,425
"It serves you right."

483
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:25,179
Yes, "It serves you right."

484
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:29,475
People pretend to be beautiful,

485
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:31,352
pretend to be nice,

486
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:34,063
and pretend to have fun.

487
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:36,774
It makes me sick.

488
00:48:39,151 --> 00:48:40,653
I may not have one myself,

489
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,073
but you guys don't have a way out either.

490
00:48:46,534 --> 00:48:47,952
So it serves you right.

491
00:48:57,836 --> 00:48:59,088
That's what I thought.

492
00:49:07,304 --> 00:49:08,138
Let's bury it.

493
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:11,225
Okay.

494
00:49:49,513 --> 00:49:50,347
Let's go.

495
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:20,002
It's beautiful!

496
00:50:21,295 --> 00:50:23,422
I love fish!

497
00:50:29,094 --> 00:50:30,179
Oh, hey.

498
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:32,723
Shall we go to Enoshima Aquarium sometime?

499
00:50:32,806 --> 00:50:34,808
They have loads of jellyfish!

500
00:50:34,892 --> 00:50:38,729
They're see-through and so pretty.

501
00:50:40,272 --> 00:50:41,982
They look like frilly dresses!

502
00:50:58,749 --> 00:51:00,042
Haruna...

503
00:51:02,503 --> 00:51:04,129
Oh, <i>Kiteretsu</i>!

504
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:08,300
My first kiss!

505
00:51:11,845 --> 00:51:13,722
<i>Wobbly, wobbly jelly!</i>

506
00:51:15,432 --> 00:51:16,934
Isn't that Yoshikawa from our school?

507
00:51:17,935 --> 00:51:19,937
<i>Wobbly, wobbly</i>

508
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,147
I bet she got some good money for that.

509
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:24,274
Very nice.

510
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:26,276
<i>Wobbly, wobbly jelly!</i>

511
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:29,863
Things aren't that simple.

512
00:51:31,782 --> 00:51:33,826
A model only needs a nice body.

513
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,494
It's not fair.

514
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:38,539
<i>It's delicious!</i>

515
00:51:39,998 --> 00:51:40,999
<i>Marry me!</i>

516
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:43,335
<i>Yes.</i>

517
00:51:44,044 --> 00:51:46,213
You're lucky, Kannonzaki.

518
00:51:47,464 --> 00:51:48,298
What?

519
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:50,801
You don't seem to have
a care in the world.

520
00:51:52,261 --> 00:51:53,137
Yes.

521
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,062
Let's go after <i>Kiteretsu</i> is done.

522
00:52:02,146 --> 00:52:03,731
Seriously? You're not staying?

523
00:52:04,314 --> 00:52:05,649
I'm not.

524
00:52:10,738 --> 00:52:12,322
Sorry, I have plans later.

525
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:13,657
Okay.

526
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:15,617
See you tomorrow, then.

527
00:52:17,536 --> 00:52:18,912
The lunch was delicious.

528
00:52:19,538 --> 00:52:20,956
Thank you, I had fun.

529
00:56:44,511 --> 00:56:45,470
Scary.

530
00:57:16,335 --> 00:57:18,128
Hey, you there.

531
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:22,883
Will you stop taking
every carton of milk we have?

532
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:25,552
What are you doing? Can't you knock first?

533
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:32,893
Is this all that's left?

534
00:57:32,976 --> 00:57:34,728
I wanted to make pudding.

535
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:37,814
Get out! Don't just come in here!

536
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:43,904
I will, if you stop going into my room.

537
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:48,158
I know you do that.

538
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:53,538
If you touch my diary again,
I'll get Mom to put a lock on the door.

539
00:57:54,998 --> 00:57:57,042
Oh, one more thing.

540
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,711
Will you stop wearing my clothes
without asking me?

541
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:01,254
It stretches them.

542
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:24,736
Yamada.

543
00:58:27,989 --> 00:58:28,990
What is it?

544
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:31,368
I thought I'd give the cats some milk.

545
00:58:33,036 --> 00:58:34,204
Do you have class?

546
00:58:34,788 --> 00:58:36,373
-I skipped it.
-Okay.

547
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:41,753
They've grown.

548
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:43,046
Yes.

549
00:58:44,131 --> 00:58:46,633
They looked like little mice
when you first found them.

550
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:51,346
Here.

551
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,564
He's greedy.

552
00:59:21,543 --> 00:59:22,419
And again!

553
00:59:23,587 --> 00:59:24,921
To me!

554
00:59:34,347 --> 00:59:36,766
You like him, right?

555
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:40,979
How did you know?

556
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:43,190
Yoshikawa told me.

557
00:59:46,526 --> 00:59:48,445
Yes, I do.

558
00:59:54,993 --> 00:59:58,538
Don't you want to tell him you like him?

559
00:59:58,747 --> 00:59:59,664
I do.

560
01:00:00,415 --> 01:00:03,376
Or that you want him to hold you?

561
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,753
-Yes.
-To kiss you?

562
01:00:04,836 --> 01:00:06,129
-Of course.
-And sex?

563
01:00:06,213 --> 01:00:07,631
I really want to.

564
01:00:13,303 --> 01:00:16,848
Do you take it or give it, Yamada?

565
01:00:17,474 --> 01:00:20,101
How do you decide when it's two men?

566
01:00:22,187 --> 01:00:23,730
Doesn't it hurt when it goes in?

567
01:00:24,439 --> 01:00:26,858
I guess you use lube like in the books?

568
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:32,239
Do you prefer having your clitoris
licked or fingered?

569
01:00:32,822 --> 01:00:34,032
What?

570
01:00:35,575 --> 01:00:37,410
Do you spit or swallow?

571
01:00:42,249 --> 01:00:45,752
It's rude to ask me about sex
just because I'm gay.

572
01:00:51,383 --> 01:00:52,217
Sorry.

573
01:00:53,843 --> 01:00:55,512
No, it's okay.

574
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,933
Rather than any of that stuff...

575
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:03,478
just being with him would be enough.

576
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,066
He's there.

577
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:09,609
I'm there.

578
01:01:12,445 --> 01:01:14,364
And I can see him.

579
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:19,452
That would be enough.

580
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:23,123
<i>Heard in the day</i>

581
01:01:23,206 --> 01:01:28,253
<i>Lull'd by the moonlight
Have all passed away</i>

582
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:33,466
<i>Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song</i>

583
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:38,722
<i>List while I woo thee with soft melody</i>

584
01:01:41,683 --> 01:01:47,105
<i>Gone are the cares of life's busy throng</i>

585
01:01:47,188 --> 01:01:52,360
<i>Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me</i>

586
01:01:53,153 --> 01:02:00,160
<i>Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me</i>

587
01:02:14,215 --> 01:02:15,258
What is it?

588
01:02:18,845 --> 01:02:20,221
Come to my place today.

589
01:02:26,436 --> 01:02:27,604
What's with you?

590
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,148
Do you have the stuff?

591
01:02:31,316 --> 01:02:32,150
No.

592
01:02:35,403 --> 01:02:36,529
I won't come, then.

593
01:02:36,613 --> 01:02:38,823
Don't say things like that.

594
01:02:42,994 --> 01:02:45,330
Isn't Haruna giving you any?

595
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,713
What?

596
01:03:00,595 --> 01:03:01,429
Hey.

597
01:03:02,555 --> 01:03:04,516
My period's late.

598
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:09,979
What will you do?

599
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,494
How did you meet
your 38-year-old boyfriend?

600
01:03:28,164 --> 01:03:29,999
A friend introduced us.

601
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:32,919
A friend?

602
01:03:33,878 --> 01:03:37,090
Yes, someone I met at a club somewhere.

603
01:03:43,221 --> 01:03:44,889
<i>What do you like about him?</i>

604
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:50,353
<i>His money.</i>

605
01:03:52,897 --> 01:03:55,024
Do your parents know about him?

606
01:03:55,108 --> 01:03:56,276
No, they don't!

607
01:03:57,193 --> 01:04:00,655
He's 38 and married, after all.

608
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:03,158
There's no way I'd introduce him to them.

609
01:04:05,285 --> 01:04:07,912
My parents trust me.

610
01:04:10,206 --> 01:04:14,794
When are you conscious
of your physical body?

611
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:19,966
<i>When I'm having sex.</i>

612
01:04:22,135 --> 01:04:25,388
What does love mean to you?

613
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:41,946
Love?

614
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:15,355
MIYASHITA, CONDOM. NAKAMURA, CAME INSIDE.
KANNONZAKI, CAME INSIDE. EISUKE, CONDOM.

615
01:05:15,438 --> 01:05:17,649
NOGUCHI, DON'T REMEMBER.
SHIBUYA DUDE, CONDOM.

616
01:05:17,732 --> 01:05:20,026
IKEBUKURO CLUB DUDE, CAME INSIDE.
YOSHIKAWA, CONDOM.

617
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,122
Rumi!

618
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:35,375
Get in the bath!

619
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:37,377
Okay!

620
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,091
Haruna, answer it!

621
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:16,249
What?

622
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:17,792
Answer the phone!

623
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:19,210
Okay!

624
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:25,425
Hello, Wakakusa residence.

625
01:06:30,138 --> 01:06:31,890
Hello?

626
01:06:34,017 --> 01:06:35,018
What happened?

627
01:06:42,275 --> 01:06:43,151
They hung up.

628
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:44,944
-Was it tasty?
-Yes.

629
01:06:49,407 --> 01:06:51,492
I'm glad!

630
01:06:52,035 --> 01:06:53,620
-Can I make you something again?
-Yes.

631
01:06:53,745 --> 01:06:55,747
Don't worry, I like cooking.

632
01:06:56,664 --> 01:06:58,917
-What do you like?
-Whatever.

633
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,585
Hey, shall we take lunch
to an aquarium again?

634
01:07:02,462 --> 01:07:05,548
Yes.

635
01:07:05,632 --> 01:07:06,466
I bought a CD earlier
that I thought you'd like.

636
01:07:08,426 --> 01:07:12,138
I'll lend it to you!

637
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:13,222
I also bought some blue wool.

638
01:07:13,431 --> 01:07:15,516
It's absolutely beautiful.

639
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,436
I thought I'd knit you a sweater.
I think blue suits you.

640
01:07:18,519 --> 01:07:23,483
Do you like blue? You could wear it
and we could go on a date.

641
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:26,653
Where shall we go?

642
01:07:26,736 --> 01:07:28,029
I'd like to go see Original Love live.

643
01:07:28,112 --> 01:07:31,407
They have a gig coming up
at Shibuya Club Quattro.

644
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:33,993
Hopefully, we can get tickets!

645
01:07:34,077 --> 01:07:35,912
And there's an interesting exhibition
on at that art gallery in Omori.

646
01:07:35,995 --> 01:07:41,584
I'd love to go there together!

647
01:07:41,668 --> 01:07:43,962
-Then there's--
-Shut up!

648
01:07:44,045 --> 01:07:45,880
Yamada?

649
01:07:47,632 --> 01:07:49,258
Do you enjoy talking about pointless crap?

650
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:53,304
About things you want me to do?

651
01:07:53,388 --> 01:07:55,848
Do you love talking about
nothing but yourself?

652
01:07:55,932 --> 01:07:58,184
I went to the bushes,
but something was different.

653
01:08:28,464 --> 01:08:30,550
Though it's all quiet now.

654
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:33,594
Has something happened?

655
01:08:37,724 --> 01:08:38,850
No, nothing.

656
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:40,852
Okay.

657
01:08:45,105 --> 01:08:45,939
-Wakakusa.
-Yes?

658
01:08:56,283 --> 01:08:57,743
Let's try calling a UFO.

659
01:09:09,005 --> 01:09:10,715
I've done it before, just once.

660
01:09:21,893 --> 01:09:23,603
How should I do it?

661
01:09:28,816 --> 01:09:30,026
Do it in your head.

662
01:09:35,073 --> 01:09:36,282
It's freezing!

663
01:10:05,895 --> 01:10:07,230
-I know, right?
-Is my fringe weird?

664
01:10:07,313 --> 01:10:09,107
-No, it's fine.
-Thanks.

665
01:10:09,982 --> 01:10:12,068
Rumi!

666
01:10:20,743 --> 01:10:21,828
-Hi!
-Morning!

667
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:24,789
Are you okay now?

668
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:25,957
You were gone for three days,
we were worried!

669
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,459
This year's colds really drag on.

670
01:10:28,543 --> 01:10:30,378
-I'm glad you're better.
-A letter!

671
01:10:30,461 --> 01:10:32,380
-What?
-What?

672
01:10:32,463 --> 01:10:33,714
-A love letter?
-Who's it from?

673
01:10:34,882 --> 01:10:37,260
Doesn't say.

674
01:10:37,969 --> 01:10:38,803
Open it!

675
01:10:38,886 --> 01:10:40,388
Who is it? I can't wait!

676
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:42,807
YOU'RE BETTER OFF DEAD

677
01:10:47,103 --> 01:10:53,276
YOU'RE BETTER OFF DEAD

678
01:10:55,945 --> 01:10:57,446
How creepy.

679
01:10:58,447 --> 01:10:59,991
Forget about it!

680
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:07,415
-Haruna! Morning!
-Morning.

681
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:13,462
Are you okay now, Koyama?

682
01:11:13,713 --> 01:11:14,547
Yes.

683
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,759
Hey, Haruna.
Do you think I should get a haircut?

684
01:11:18,843 --> 01:11:21,262
-Or should I grow it out?
-I don't care.

685
01:11:21,345 --> 01:11:23,431
-What should I do?
-Whatever!

686
01:11:23,514 --> 01:11:25,433
-Which one?
-Move.

687
01:11:25,516 --> 01:11:26,976
-Which?
-Enough already!

688
01:11:27,059 --> 01:11:29,228
-Which is better?
-I don't care!

689
01:11:34,192 --> 01:11:36,235
You're skipping class.

690
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:38,279
Period pain.

691
01:11:40,865 --> 01:11:42,575
Only kidding.

692
01:11:44,744 --> 01:11:46,537
Come here for a minute.

693
01:11:46,621 --> 01:11:48,873
-I found something interesting.
-What?

694
01:11:48,956 --> 01:11:49,916
You'll see, come on!

695
01:11:52,668 --> 01:11:54,420
-One second.
-It's fine.

696
01:11:54,503 --> 01:11:55,546
Hey!

697
01:11:59,675 --> 01:12:00,718
Yoshikawa!

698
01:12:00,801 --> 01:12:02,345
Wakakusa!

699
01:12:04,555 --> 01:12:05,890
-This way!
-What is it?

700
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:08,601
What? What is it?

701
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:10,144
Over there.

702
01:12:18,069 --> 01:12:18,903
Here.

703
01:12:20,446 --> 01:12:21,489
Take a look.

704
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:26,661
Isn't it crazy?

705
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:29,580
I think it's a cat or something.

706
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,500
It looks like meatballs!

707
01:13:19,588 --> 01:13:21,799
I'm sorry, Wakakusa.

708
01:13:24,635 --> 01:13:26,178
I didn't mean for this to happen.

709
01:13:31,142 --> 01:13:31,976
Hey.

710
01:13:32,977 --> 01:13:33,978
I'm sorry.

711
01:13:36,772 --> 01:13:38,274
Please don't cry.

712
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:41,777
I'm sorry.

713
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:52,747
Nice and loud!

714
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:55,958
Three, four, five, six,

715
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:57,585
seven, eight...

716
01:14:03,883 --> 01:14:05,384
What a beautiful color!

717
01:14:05,468 --> 01:14:06,594
Is it a present?

718
01:14:06,677 --> 01:14:08,929
Yamada likes blue.

719
01:14:10,473 --> 01:14:11,891
That's so nice!

720
01:14:11,974 --> 01:14:16,228
He doesn't shut up about
wanting me to knit for him!

721
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:21,442
-That's so nice!
-I envy you!

722
01:14:21,525 --> 01:14:24,612
-It's so cool that you can knit!
-You're really good!

723
01:14:24,695 --> 01:14:27,323
-That will really suit him!
-Right!

724
01:14:27,406 --> 01:14:29,492
It's so cute!

725
01:14:29,575 --> 01:14:31,410
How lovely!

726
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:37,708
What's this about? It's freezing.

727
01:14:38,834 --> 01:14:40,586
You'd fuck me if we were indoors.

728
01:14:42,296 --> 01:14:44,256
Or maybe you don't mind being outside?

729
01:14:44,632 --> 01:14:45,674
What does that mean?

730
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:49,261
All you think about is sex.

731
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:52,973
I asked if you had
the stuff earlier, right?

732
01:14:53,557 --> 01:14:55,184
What are you talking about?

733
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:01,941
Give me money.

734
01:15:03,067 --> 01:15:03,901
What?

735
01:15:04,819 --> 01:15:05,903
For the operation.

736
01:15:10,908 --> 01:15:11,742
How much?

737
01:15:12,993 --> 01:15:13,953
It's 150,000.

738
01:15:14,203 --> 01:15:15,287
What?

739
01:15:15,663 --> 01:15:17,706
There's no way it costs that much.

740
01:15:18,874 --> 01:15:20,000
Well, it does.

741
01:15:21,335 --> 01:15:22,628
Is it really mine?

742
01:15:25,089 --> 01:15:27,049
Why didn't you use protection?

743
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:32,763
It wasn't just when we were high,
you've never used at all!

744
01:15:39,437 --> 01:15:41,272
Even though you use one with Haruna!

745
01:15:48,904 --> 01:15:50,489
I don't have that kind of money.

746
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:53,284
You said you'd get cash for the stuff.

747
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:54,577
I've run out.

748
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:57,705
But you still have money
to buy Haruna a present?

749
01:16:07,423 --> 01:16:08,591
All right.

750
01:16:09,967 --> 01:16:11,469
But I can't give you all of it.

751
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,978
Haruna doesn't like you at all.

752
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:23,856
What do you mean?

753
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:25,649
She told me.

754
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,071
"I don't like Kannonzaki at all.
He's a dumbass.

755
01:16:31,155 --> 01:16:32,948
He gets pissed
when I don't let him fuck me."

756
01:16:37,244 --> 01:16:39,747
I don't like you at all, either.

757
01:16:40,164 --> 01:16:41,040
Shut your mouth.

758
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:47,171
Even your parents
don't care about you, right?

759
01:16:47,254 --> 01:16:49,423
-They totally neglect you!
-Stop it.

760
01:16:49,965 --> 01:16:53,886
-What can you do? You're nothing.
-Stop it.

761
01:16:53,969 --> 01:16:57,848
You're a piece of shit, bullying thief
who fucks his girlfriend's friend!

762
01:16:57,932 --> 01:16:59,767
And who's the father of that brat?

763
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,310
You're a piece of shit!

764
01:17:05,356 --> 01:17:06,941
Violence again!

765
01:17:07,566 --> 01:17:10,194
Because nobody likes you!

766
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:13,197
-Because nobody loves you!
-Stop it!

767
01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:17,952
Are your feelings hurt?

768
01:17:18,619 --> 01:17:20,037
What a dumbass!

769
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:35,427
Stop it...

770
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:37,096
Stop it...

771
01:17:37,638 --> 01:17:38,931
Stop it...

772
01:17:39,014 --> 01:17:41,016
Stop it...

773
01:17:41,392 --> 01:17:43,644
Stop it...

774
01:17:50,401 --> 01:17:51,235
Incredible.

775
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:54,780
It's my mom's hobby.
It looks like a love hotel.

776
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:58,617
-Are you hungry?
-Oh, yes.

777
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:08,002
I've ordered some food.

778
01:18:11,922 --> 01:18:12,756
Sit down.

779
01:18:20,514 --> 01:18:22,391
-Would you like some wine?
-Yes.

780
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,568
I might be quitting school.

781
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:34,737
Really?

782
01:18:36,363 --> 01:18:37,239
Yes.

783
01:18:39,116 --> 01:18:41,452
I'm going to be a regular
on three TV shows.

784
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:45,247
I worked hard in my freshman year,
but sophomore might not be so good.

785
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:49,001
I wanted to go to college.

786
01:19:07,144 --> 01:19:08,812
I won't be able to eat all this.

787
01:19:09,146 --> 01:19:11,315
Don't worry, I will.

788
01:19:12,358 --> 01:19:13,525
You're joking.

789
01:19:14,693 --> 01:19:18,113
It's fine. I'll throw it up after anyway.

790
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:35,107
Would you like a coffee?

791
01:20:36,233 --> 01:20:37,067
Sure.

792
01:20:40,821 --> 01:20:41,822
Thanks.

793
01:20:45,492 --> 01:20:49,037
Do you hate me now, Wakakusa?

794
01:20:54,918 --> 01:20:56,336
Not at all.

795
01:21:04,428 --> 01:21:08,098
I like you, Wakakusa.

796
01:21:43,884 --> 01:21:45,552
We'll buy gloves in a convenience store.

797
01:21:50,766 --> 01:21:52,059
Don't tell anybody!

798
01:21:52,142 --> 01:21:52,976
Anybody!

799
01:21:53,393 --> 01:21:55,604
-I'll kill you if you do.
-What will you do?

800
01:21:56,814 --> 01:21:57,898
Come on, let's go.

801
01:21:57,981 --> 01:21:59,983
It takes ages to bury someone.

802
01:22:02,653 --> 01:22:03,529
Oh, yes.

803
01:22:03,946 --> 01:22:05,989
-I'll call two more people.
-What?

804
01:22:06,156 --> 01:22:08,617
We've dug together before,
so it's perfect.

805
01:22:09,368 --> 01:22:10,244
Who?

806
01:22:11,453 --> 01:22:13,080
Wakakusa and Yoshikawa.

807
01:22:13,914 --> 01:22:15,833
What's going on with you and Haruna?

808
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:17,751
Nothing.

809
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:20,212
I have no sexual interest in girls.

810
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:25,759
And you don't have to worry about
being with me. I hate you.

811
01:22:37,396 --> 01:22:38,230
Okay.

812
01:22:39,523 --> 01:22:41,733
Okay. Okay, got it.

813
01:22:57,708 --> 01:22:58,542
What is it?

814
01:22:59,126 --> 01:23:00,127
It was Yamada.

815
01:23:01,837 --> 01:23:04,006
He said he found a new dead body!

816
01:23:04,798 --> 01:23:06,717
He wants us to go see it now
before he buries it.

817
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:10,012
What do you mean?

818
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:54,306
NO TRESPASSING

819
01:25:27,149 --> 01:25:28,316
What are you doing?

820
01:25:30,569 --> 01:25:32,779
That's not yours to look at!

821
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,948
Fuck you!

822
01:25:35,032 --> 01:25:36,366
You frustrated, ugly bitch!

823
01:25:37,576 --> 01:25:39,661
What have you been doing?

824
01:25:40,037 --> 01:25:41,830
You're such an idiot!

825
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:44,249
A child you don't know who the father is?

826
01:25:44,624 --> 01:25:47,002
What will you do?

827
01:25:47,252 --> 01:25:50,547
"I got 50,000 just for having sex once."

828
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:53,467
That's prostitution!

829
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:55,927
It's none of your business!

830
01:25:56,094 --> 01:25:57,846
Shut up, you pig!

831
01:25:57,929 --> 01:25:59,473
Get out, you ugly bitch!

832
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:01,892
Stop writing your gay manga!

833
01:26:01,975 --> 01:26:03,935
Try getting yourself a boyfriend!

834
01:26:04,019 --> 01:26:05,228
Lose some weight, fatty!

835
01:26:05,687 --> 01:26:06,855
You pig!

836
01:26:42,516 --> 01:26:44,059
Die!

837
01:26:44,184 --> 01:26:45,977
Die!

838
01:26:46,269 --> 01:26:49,564
Die!

839
01:26:51,274 --> 01:26:52,526
Hey!

840
01:26:54,444 --> 01:26:56,363
What's going on? You're being so loud...

841
01:27:40,866 --> 01:27:42,951
Haruna!

842
01:27:43,034 --> 01:27:46,371
Haruna!

843
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:50,625
Where is it?

844
01:27:52,377 --> 01:27:54,546
-It went off somewhere.
-What?

845
01:27:54,796 --> 01:27:56,173
It was here a minute ago.

846
01:27:57,007 --> 01:27:58,049
I see.

847
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,801
That sucks.

848
01:28:00,844 --> 01:28:02,804
I'm sorry. That's not right.

849
01:28:02,888 --> 01:28:04,556
Koyama and I weren't like that.

850
01:28:06,641 --> 01:28:08,518
I'm so sorry!

851
01:28:08,602 --> 01:28:09,769
I'm sorry!

852
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:23,450
Hello.

853
01:28:24,951 --> 01:28:26,703
Is Ichiro home?

854
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:33,627
Okay, I see.

855
01:28:41,176 --> 01:28:42,093
Hello.

856
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:44,596
Is Haruna there?

857
01:28:59,945 --> 01:29:05,158
Die.

858
01:29:11,498 --> 01:29:12,499
I'm sorry.

859
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:15,794
Let's head off.

860
01:29:17,003 --> 01:29:18,213
Wakakusa.

861
01:29:26,888 --> 01:29:28,515
What's with you two?

862
01:29:30,183 --> 01:29:31,685
What kind of relationship is this?

863
01:29:32,727 --> 01:29:33,687
What kind...

864
01:29:36,982 --> 01:29:39,901
-Surely not you and Yamada?
-I told you we're not!

865
01:29:39,985 --> 01:29:41,569
Then what?

866
01:29:51,913 --> 01:29:54,332
Don't make fun of me, Yamada!

867
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:57,585
-If only you weren't around...
-Stop it, Kannonzaki!

868
01:29:57,669 --> 01:30:00,880
You're the person I like more than anyone!

869
01:30:00,964 --> 01:30:05,218
I'm sorry I couldn't say
that until now. I'm sorry!

870
01:30:05,301 --> 01:30:07,387
-I won't leave you alone again!
-Haruna!

871
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,639
-Haruna!
-I'm sorry!

872
01:30:10,306 --> 01:30:11,474
I'm sorry!

873
01:30:26,448 --> 01:30:27,782
Let's leave the idiot here.

874
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:31,870
But what about Wakakusa?

875
01:30:50,972 --> 01:30:53,433
She'll be fine.

876
01:30:54,684 --> 01:30:57,062
It has nothing to do with her.

877
01:30:58,271 --> 01:30:59,647
So she'll be fine.

878
01:31:07,155 --> 01:31:10,158
This is Wakakusa's.

879
01:31:11,826 --> 01:31:13,328
From when we dug that hole.

880
01:31:48,905 --> 01:31:51,074
Haruna!

881
01:31:51,241 --> 01:31:54,953
Haruna...

882
01:31:58,039 --> 01:32:02,168
Haruna...

883
01:33:27,962 --> 01:33:30,548
How long have you been dating Yamada?

884
01:33:30,965 --> 01:33:32,550
Since December last year.

885
01:33:33,885 --> 01:33:37,889
I like Ozawa who used
to be in Flipper's Guitar.

886
01:33:39,974 --> 01:33:44,145
I was listening to his first solo album
in the Shibuya HMV,

887
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:48,983
and Yamada was nearby,
also listening to it.

888
01:33:49,651 --> 01:33:52,153
I knew who he was,

889
01:33:53,446 --> 01:33:56,616
but we were in different classes,

890
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,788
but I thought he had
such a beautiful face.

891
01:34:02,372 --> 01:34:05,208
There's something special about Yamada.

892
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:10,213
He dresses so well,
he has a sort of mysterious vibe,

893
01:34:10,296 --> 01:34:15,301
and he's just kind of different
from the other rough boys.

894
01:34:16,052 --> 01:34:21,349
But I thought it would be a mistake
to talk to him at school,

895
01:34:22,225 --> 01:34:24,894
so I thought I'd talk to him there.

896
01:34:24,978 --> 01:34:29,107
We went straight to a café
on Spain-zaka together,

897
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:33,569
and from there I started
to lend him all kinds of CDs.

898
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:37,073
Then, at Christmas,

899
01:34:37,949 --> 01:34:40,952
I plucked up the courage
to ask him to be my boyfriend,

900
01:34:42,036 --> 01:34:43,788
and he just said "Okay"!

901
01:34:44,872 --> 01:34:47,792
I really couldn't believe

902
01:34:48,751 --> 01:34:50,962
that it had happened.

903
01:34:51,045 --> 01:34:53,089
I was so happy.

904
01:34:54,215 --> 01:34:55,925
And now you're happy, right?

905
01:34:56,092 --> 01:34:57,885
Yes, I am.

906
01:34:58,469 --> 01:34:59,679
Really happy.

907
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:03,933
Well...

908
01:35:04,559 --> 01:35:08,521
Do you ever think to yourself
you're happy to be alive?

909
01:35:11,107 --> 01:35:12,900
I'm happy to be alive.

910
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:30,626
I'm happy to be alive.

911
01:35:57,111 --> 01:36:01,032
<i>The snow that falls on top of Mount Fuji</i>

912
01:36:01,783 --> 01:36:05,995
<i>And the snow that falls
On Ponto-cho in Kyoto</i>

913
01:36:06,371 --> 01:36:10,249
<i>They're both the same snow, aren't they?</i>

914
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:14,754
<i>Once they're thawed, everyone's the same</i>

915
01:36:14,921 --> 01:36:16,964
-Hey.
-Yes?

916
01:36:18,091 --> 01:36:21,177
Lots of crazy shit has happened
at school lately, hasn't it?

917
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,261
Sure has.

918
01:36:22,887 --> 01:36:25,264
You know, it's because in the Edo period,

919
01:36:26,057 --> 01:36:27,975
they used to execute people there.

920
01:36:28,059 --> 01:36:29,185
For real?

921
01:36:29,811 --> 01:36:32,605
And, it's been seen recently.

922
01:36:33,064 --> 01:36:33,898
What has?

923
01:36:35,024 --> 01:36:36,734
Kanna Tajima's ghost.

924
01:36:37,151 --> 01:36:38,403
That's not funny.

925
01:36:39,654 --> 01:36:41,406
That was crazy.

926
01:36:41,906 --> 01:36:44,367
I bet she was trying to set
Wakakusa's apartment on fire.

927
01:36:44,534 --> 01:36:46,953
Then she caught fire!

928
01:36:49,247 --> 01:36:50,331
It's Yamada's fault.

929
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,583
Yamada's crazy, isn't he?

930
01:36:53,334 --> 01:36:54,752
He is.

931
01:36:57,213 --> 01:36:58,256
Jeez.

932
01:36:58,464 --> 01:36:59,590
He scares me.

933
01:38:09,994 --> 01:38:12,038
Rumi had a baby.

934
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:16,584
Yes.

935
01:38:18,544 --> 01:38:20,713
I didn't know she has a big sister either.

936
01:38:24,926 --> 01:38:25,760
Right.

937
01:38:29,514 --> 01:38:31,641
I don't think we could
have done anything...

938
01:38:34,143 --> 01:38:35,436
But I wish she told us.

939
01:38:43,486 --> 01:38:45,196
Are you really moving?

940
01:38:47,323 --> 01:38:48,157
Yes.

941
01:38:50,826 --> 01:38:52,870
My mom said it's hard
living in the apartment block.

942
01:38:56,874 --> 01:38:58,501
And my room was burned to a crisp.

943
01:39:00,336 --> 01:39:01,504
I see.

944
01:39:02,672 --> 01:39:03,798
Okay.

945
01:39:58,019 --> 01:39:59,145
Haruna!

946
01:40:00,271 --> 01:40:02,523
Shall we have a coffee break in a minute?

947
01:40:02,857 --> 01:40:03,774
Sure.

948
01:40:05,818 --> 01:40:08,154
We've got more luggage than I expected.

949
01:40:10,906 --> 01:40:12,158
I don't have much.

950
01:40:13,618 --> 01:40:16,037
It's because we threw
the fire extinguisher out.

951
01:40:18,789 --> 01:40:21,584
I still hadn't paid off the turntable.

952
01:40:23,336 --> 01:40:24,795
What can you do?

953
01:40:28,633 --> 01:40:29,592
Yes!

954
01:40:34,096 --> 01:40:36,766
-Hi! I came to help out.
-Okay.

955
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:45,941
Hey.

956
01:40:47,902 --> 01:40:48,736
Hey.

957
01:40:51,739 --> 01:40:53,407
Do you have any attachment to the town?

958
01:41:01,582 --> 01:41:02,667
I'm not sure.

959
01:41:04,502 --> 01:41:07,254
What's happening to you and Kannonzaki?

960
01:41:09,799 --> 01:41:11,384
I don't think I'll ever see him again.

961
01:41:12,593 --> 01:41:17,723
I think he will be relieved once I'm gone.

962
01:41:42,456 --> 01:41:43,916
You're a lifesaver!

963
01:41:44,542 --> 01:41:46,419
-Keep it up!
-You got it!

964
01:41:54,885 --> 01:41:56,470
<i>Do you feel sad at all?</i>

965
01:41:57,138 --> 01:41:58,556
What do you mean by "sad"?

966
01:42:00,391 --> 01:42:03,728
Like you've lost something
precious to you.

967
01:42:09,275 --> 01:42:14,155
Well then I guess I'm not sad, I think.

968
01:42:16,574 --> 01:42:19,368
Do you feel like you're alive?

969
01:42:28,002 --> 01:42:29,587
If I had to say...

970
01:42:31,881 --> 01:42:33,215
I don't feel alive.

971
01:42:34,341 --> 01:42:35,760
What do you mean by that?

972
01:42:36,302 --> 01:42:37,678
Because I don't change.

973
01:42:38,179 --> 01:42:39,138
You don't change?

974
01:42:39,346 --> 01:42:41,766
Yes, like a stone...

975
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:44,685
or plastic.

976
01:42:45,644 --> 01:42:48,856
I guess I'm like them
because I don't change much.

977
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:54,320
So what do you think it means to be alive?

978
01:43:12,171 --> 01:43:15,508
Feeling things, I think.

979
01:43:19,303 --> 01:43:23,098
Feeling the warmth of warm things,

980
01:43:23,682 --> 01:43:25,726
or the coldness of cold things...

981
01:43:27,061 --> 01:43:28,813
That's what I think it is.

982
01:43:33,859 --> 01:43:34,902
Recently...

983
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:40,741
there was a day
that a lot of stuff happened.

984
01:43:54,588 --> 01:43:56,674
Kanna Tajima died...

985
01:43:59,468 --> 01:44:00,678
and Rumi...

986
01:44:01,929 --> 01:44:02,930
lost

987
01:44:04,265 --> 01:44:05,599
her baby.

988
01:44:07,935 --> 01:44:11,230
I don't know if it's appropriate...

989
01:44:13,148 --> 01:44:16,151
to use the word "felt".

990
01:44:19,738 --> 01:44:25,536
But even though I never even knew
that it existed...

991
01:44:26,829 --> 01:44:32,084
I felt like I'd lost someone
for the first time in my life.

992
01:44:37,006 --> 01:44:39,675
But will you go on living life?

993
01:44:42,970 --> 01:44:44,179
I want to live my life.

994
01:44:49,935 --> 01:44:51,520
How will you live your life?

995
01:44:57,067 --> 01:44:58,235
Wounded.

996
01:45:00,404 --> 01:45:01,572
Forgetting.

997
01:45:03,115 --> 01:45:04,450
Remembering.

998
01:45:07,536 --> 01:45:12,166
Sometimes crying,
sometimes getting angry...

999
01:45:14,001 --> 01:45:15,878
Sometimes smiling and laughing.

1000
01:45:20,633 --> 01:45:22,217
I want to live my life feeling things.

1001
01:45:43,322 --> 01:45:44,490
I want to live my life.

1002
01:46:03,467 --> 01:46:06,220
I have school tomorrow
so I won't be able to see you off.

1003
01:46:06,762 --> 01:46:07,596
See you.

1004
01:46:09,056 --> 01:46:09,974
Thank you.

1005
01:46:10,599 --> 01:46:11,558
Take care.

1006
01:46:13,227 --> 01:46:14,103
See you.

1007
01:46:16,313 --> 01:46:17,231
Goodnight.

1008
01:46:52,808 --> 01:46:53,809
Wakakusa.

1009
01:46:55,936 --> 01:46:56,895
Yamada.

1010
01:47:02,192 --> 01:47:04,987
Here. Maybe you could take this with you.

1011
01:47:07,156 --> 01:47:08,073
What is it?

1012
01:47:08,782 --> 01:47:10,909
It has my favorite poem
of William Gibson in it.

1013
01:47:11,785 --> 01:47:13,579
-William?
-William Gibson.

1014
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:25,424
Thank you.

1015
01:47:30,345 --> 01:47:31,513
Shall we go for a little walk?

1016
01:47:35,434 --> 01:47:36,268
Okay.

1017
01:48:18,852 --> 01:48:19,812
<i>What's up?</i>

1018
01:48:20,521 --> 01:48:21,355
<i>Nothing.</i>

1019
01:48:23,732 --> 01:48:25,067
<i>It was very sudden, wasn't it?</i>

1020
01:48:28,028 --> 01:48:28,904
<i>Well...</i>

1021
01:48:29,696 --> 01:48:32,407
<i>It's just an early spring break.</i>

1039
01:49:58,660 --> 01:49:59,661
Recently...

1040
01:50:01,038 --> 01:50:01,872
Yes?

1041
01:50:02,164 --> 01:50:03,749
I saw Tajima's ghost.

1042
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,043
What?

1043
01:50:07,336 --> 01:50:08,962
Maybe it was my imagination.

1044
01:50:09,922 --> 01:50:11,590
But I think I saw her at school.

1045
01:50:18,263 --> 01:50:19,181
You think?

1046
01:50:20,724 --> 01:50:24,645
To put it more accurately,
I sensed, not saw her.

1047
01:50:26,230 --> 01:50:28,690
Like she was just there,
not doing anything.

1048
01:50:36,782 --> 01:50:38,242
But it doesn't bother me.

1049
01:50:42,162 --> 01:50:44,039
I like her more...

1050
01:50:46,166 --> 01:50:48,418
when she's dead than when she's alive.

1051
01:50:54,633 --> 01:50:57,803
But I wish I liked her more
when she was still alive.

1052
01:51:10,023 --> 01:51:11,400
Do you...

1053
01:51:14,945 --> 01:51:17,197
not like people unless they're dead?

1054
01:51:20,033 --> 01:51:21,326
That's not it.

1055
01:51:21,576 --> 01:51:23,078
I like her.

1056
01:51:26,373 --> 01:51:27,457
Is that right?

1057
01:51:30,711 --> 01:51:31,670
Besides...

1058
01:51:35,048 --> 01:51:37,342
you're alive, and I like you.

1059
01:51:49,313 --> 01:51:50,188
I mean it.

1060
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:57,988
I'm going to miss you when you're gone.

1061
01:52:18,675 --> 01:52:19,760
Wakakusa.

1062
01:52:22,471 --> 01:52:24,473
Let's try calling a UFO one more time.

1063
01:52:29,436 --> 01:52:30,645
Let's try again.

00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,255
你的泰迪熊怎么了？

3
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:03,465
这个？

4
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:12,474
好吧，我爸爸买了这只熊
当我三岁。

5
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:17,145
不是我记得的，
这正是我妈妈说的。

6
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:25,362
他在休息区买的
当我们去旅行的时候。

7
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,031
我一直...

8
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:36,415
父亲买了这个，但那不是
我养这只熊的原因。

9
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:40,669
毛绒玩具很难
扔进垃圾桶，对吧？

10
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,212
他们有眼睛！

11
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:44,756
她有名字吗？

12
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,678
是的。

13
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,764
顾。

14
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,308
就这样。

15
00:01:57,144 --> 00:01:59,062
她有一张可爱的脸，对吧？

16
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:38,643
学校...

17
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,256
你在哪里？

18
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:11,760
你在哪里？

19
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:56,638
山田？

20
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:08,275
<i>我是特快列车上的工程师</i>

21
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,027
<i>每个车站都有漂亮的女孩</i>

22
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:13,947
<i>但当你只停留三分钟时</i>

23
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:16,908
<i>没有足够的时间亲吻他们</i>

24
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,995
<i>-东京、京都、大阪</i>
-嘿。

25
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:20,912
是的？

26
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:24,624
你知道广告
和牧濑里穗在海里？

27
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,542
是的。

28
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:28,670
显然有一张女人的脸
在水里。

29
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,672
-真正的？
-真正的。

30
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,383
这是一个溺水妇女的鬼魂。

31
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,135
什么？真正的？

32
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:37,137
- 可怕，对吧？
-是的！

33
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,348
显然你可以看到它
如果你暂停视频。

34
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,766
-没门！
-这是真的。

35
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:44,811
没门！看到了吗，高桥？

36
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,438
-什么，我？
-是的。

37
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:49,816
我想我看到了。

38
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,109
-真正的？
-是的。

39
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:54,404
这太可怕了。

40
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:56,114
-这是正确的？
-是的！

41
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,604
-若草。
-是的？

42
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:36,488
你闻不到海的味道吗？

43
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,792
<i>我们镇上有一条河。</i>

44
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:53,171
<i>它靠近河口，
水散开并停滞不前。</i>

45
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,339
<i>味道不好。</i>

46
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:58,510
<i>加拿大一枝黄花生长在河边，</i>

47
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:01,721
<i>而且你会经常看到死猫
周边地区。</i>

48
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:29,666
不得擅自闯入

49
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:30,834
波奇！

50
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,628
你在哪里？

51
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:37,173
该回家了。

52
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:39,300
波奇！

53
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:42,512
波奇！

54
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:44,514
玩过吗？

55
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:47,267
哦，你有东西。

56
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:50,270
你找到好东西了吗？

57
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:53,148
你发现了什么？

58
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:56,818
你发现了什么？

59
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:57,819
正确的。

60
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:00,071
来吧，波奇。

61
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,156
该走了。

62
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:04,075
好的，波奇！

63
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:06,995
好的。

64
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:08,913
我们回家吧。

65
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:16,963
鲁米！

66
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,798
这就是兰蔻 Définicils！

67
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:20,008
是的。

68
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,594
我找了人给我买。

69
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:25,096
我希望我的男朋友是 38 岁！

70
00:07:25,263 --> 00:07:27,057
让高桥给你买一个。

71
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,516
就像那样会发生！

72
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,060
耀西！

73
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,439
榛名！昨天还好吗？

74
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:37,484
<i>乌戈乌戈鲁加</i>
到家的时候已经结束了。

75
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,694
我妈妈生我的气。

76
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:42,364
哦，还有观音崎。

77
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:43,281
什么？

78
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:50,789
早晨！

79
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,969
我不知道观音崎和榛名如何
目前正在做。

80
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:07,263
不要问我。

81
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,642
她把事情留给自己太多了。

82
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,353
她甚至没有说他们在一起。

83
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,939
虽然他很热！

84
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,234
我受不了观音崎。

85
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:21,861
榛名对男人没有品味。

86
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:27,242
-你个混蛋！
-好痛。

87
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,245
-山田和储物柜！
-它是什么？

88
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:31,745
你太可怕了！

89
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,831
什么？

90
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:35,166
你怎么知道？

91
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,628
-Yoshie 告诉我的。
-高桥？

92
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:40,755
太可怕了！

93
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:42,966
漆黑一片，冰冷的……

94
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,094
-你去帮助他？
-我当然做了！

95
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:48,221
再做类似的事情
我会杀了你！

96
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,561
什么？

97
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:56,604
你和山田有什么关系吗？

98
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:58,898
别傻了！

99
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,485
是田岛环奈。

100
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:05,113
也许她在找山田。

101
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:10,034
他还没来！

102
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:11,161
嘿。

103
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:12,787
-早晨。
-早晨。

104
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:15,290
或许传闻并不属实。

105
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:17,750
-什么？
- 那个山田的同性恋。

106
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:21,087
有人在新宿见过他，
和一个男孩手牵手。

107
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,299
我听说他和大一新生在一起
吉川小泽。

108
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:27,218
你是说那个模特儿？

109
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:31,347
显然他们去了灌木丛
一起在河边。

110
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,393
我打赌你是从高桥那里听说的。

111
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:38,605
他所说的一切都不是真的。

112
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,441
嘿，这很卑鄙！

113
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:46,988
-停下来！
-今天来我家吧。

114
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,072
没人在家。

115
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,911
在你的梦里，笨蛋！

116
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,343
吃多少就吃多少。

117
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:09,969
你也是，普纳。

118
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,309
早安，丸！

119
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:19,687
你一定是困了。

120
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:23,816
怎么了？

121
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:26,361
你有一双漂亮的眼睛，不是吗？

122
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:59,769
关于公民自由，
有良心自由，

123
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:03,982
身体自由，经济自由。

124
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:10,488
良心自由意味着自由
随心所欲地思考和说话。

125
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,409
宗教信仰，人们的聚会，

126
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:15,868
表达方式，

127
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:20,748
学习之类的不是
受国家限制，

128
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:24,294
个人自由必须得到保护。

129
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:27,297
这个原则

130
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,219
是基于国家的控制
战前的神道教，

131
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:35,930
并且它的持续性受到深切关注。

132
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:40,893
现在，言论自由...

133
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,020
别惹我。

134
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:45,231
这意味着给予的权利
你对别人的看法...

135
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,943
<i>请告诉我们您的姓名。</i>

136
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,570
我是观音崎

137
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:52,530
很高兴见到你。

138
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:54,949
你家中有多少成员？

139
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:58,786
有我的爸爸，我的妈妈，
我的大哥，还有我。

140
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,871
我的亲密家庭。

141
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,706
你的近亲？

142
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:05,418
我爸妈没在一起

143
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:10,131
我想你可以说
他们不关心彼此。

144
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:12,467
她发现他出轨了，

145
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,510
这是同一个老故事。

146
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:20,600
我妈妈喜欢跳舞，
她整个星期什么都没做。

147
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,146
我爸爸和他办公室的一个女人...

148
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,608
我说“女人”，但她大约 45 岁，
她实际上是一个奶奶。

149
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:33,571
他们一起逃跑了
去年秋天左右，

150
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:36,407
但他们回来了
大约一周后结束。

151
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:39,619
现在一切正常。

152
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:42,372
我们都表现得好像什么都没发生一样。

153
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:47,877
你女朋友知道吗
关于你的家人？

154
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:50,463
不，我还没有和她谈过这件事。

155
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:51,798
为什么不？

156
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:55,843
我不认为她会感兴趣
在这样的事情中，

157
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:59,097
而她身边只有她妈妈，

158
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:03,142
所以她可能会嫉妒我
因为有两个父母。

159
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:06,813
你们两个是怎么开始见面的？

160
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,944
我想这感觉不错。

161
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:16,280
她有时真的很生气，

162
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:22,036
但她不会太怀疑，
所以她很容易相处。

163
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,084
闭上你的嘴！

164
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:44,809
跳闸。

165
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,186
剥什么？

166
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,899
我叫你脱！

167
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:55,778
跳闸！

168
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:58,197
跳闸！

169
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:01,033
跳闸！

170
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:02,702
跳闸！

171
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,719
-Haruna的逃课！
-我头疼。

172
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:21,387
我饿死了。

173
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:24,640
我敢打赌你又想要那个粗乌冬面了。

174
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:27,435
-现在是我的最爱！
-没门！

175
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,439
这是一场纸质暴风雪！

176
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:34,567
哇！

177
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,651
太奇妙了！

178
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:39,739
山田一郎

179
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,745
-怪异的！你看到了吗？
-我认同。

180
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,163
真正的？

181
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:50,416
-嘿！
-观音崎在哪里？

182
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,627
- 他说他今天下午要逃课。
-山田在哪里？

183
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:57,799
-我不知道。
-你在撒谎！

184
00:14:57,882 --> 00:14:59,467
这是什么？

185
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:05,473
那家伙疯了。

186
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:08,893
我们只是在胡闹。

187
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:09,977
你是什么意思？

188
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:12,355
做一点事。

189
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:14,899
这是只有女朋友才能说的。

190
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,692
山田在哪里？

191
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,822
老化学实验室。

192
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,415
不得擅自闯入

193
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:34,335
山田！

194
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,384
没关系。

195
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,469
是若草。

196
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:48,516
我带来了你的衣服。你在哪里？

197
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:57,817
这边。

198
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:22,675
对不起，又发生了。

199
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:25,428
没关系。

200
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,858
-若草。
-是的？

201
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:41,444
你今晚有空吗？

202
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:44,780
是的。

203
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,494
我会告诉你我的秘密宝藏。

204
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,081
什么？

205
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,251
我想让你看看。

206
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,674
<i>臭氧层消耗率</i>

207
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:06,552
<i>在过去 17 年中从 5% 上升到 10%。</i>

208
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:10,722
<i>释放的碳氟化合物量
人类进入大气层</i>

209
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:13,351
<i>是 1500 万吨。</i>

210
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:18,356
<i>大约 10%，150 万吨，
到达平流层，</i>

211
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,983
<i>破坏臭氧层。</i>

212
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:28,199
妈妈，我要和一个朋友见面，
锅里有咖喱，哈鲁娜

213
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:02,900
对不起！

214
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:12,076
轮到我做饭了。

215
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:16,580
你小时候是什么样的？

216
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,628
上小学的时候，
我总是去图书馆。

217
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:26,007
我喜欢关于不明飞行物的书。

218
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:31,637
我一直想看一个。

219
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:34,765
我从小学开始就被欺负了。

220
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,770
有一天，我被打得很惨。

221
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:46,402
我的整个身体都是黑色和蓝色，
我不能让我父母知道。

222
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:49,155
让你的父母发现是最糟糕的。

223
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:50,906
所以...

224
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:54,910
我不想回家。

225
00:18:56,203 --> 00:19:01,125
我从屋顶仰望天空
直到天黑。

226
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:05,463
我一直希望有一个不明飞行物出现。

227
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,303
我想我在那里呆了几个小时。

228
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:20,352
我仍然感到强烈的愿望
时不时去看一个。

229
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:23,105
它不一定是不明飞行物。

230
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,067
我猜...

231
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:34,909
我想完全看一些东西
不同于现实的出现。

232
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:14,115
你好，小山家。

233
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:33,300
<i>给你打电话。有个叫观音崎的男孩。</i>

234
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,344
好的。

235
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:37,555
<i>不要再打长电话了。</i>

236
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,266
<i>妈妈说你让她付出代价--</i>

237
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:41,767
好的。

238
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,816
它是什么？

239
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:52,194
什么？

240
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:05,207
那太残忍了。

241
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,962
每个人都讨厌我。

242
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:11,505
这不是真的。

243
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:15,926
我敢打赌，有些女孩喜欢你。

244
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:18,596
他们认为你可爱或神秘——

245
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,055
我不是那样的好人。

246
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,811
我想毁了人们
谁把我当成虫子，

247
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:29,440
把他们的皮肤翻过来，加盐，
并将其喂给狗。

248
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:34,028
我想把垃圾丢进嘴里
那些看着和笑的女孩。

249
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:37,489
这就是我一直在想的。

250
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:52,922
我是同性恋。

251
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,431
你可以叫我同性恋，基佬，
变态，什么的。

252
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:09,438
但是你没有看到B班的田岛吗？

253
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:13,984
那只是一种行为。

254
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:22,242
田岛知道吗？

255
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:23,744
不。

256
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,871
这对她不公平，真的。

257
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:34,797
你是第一个正常人
我曾经说过，若草。

258
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,369
真的没事吗？

259
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:06,704
没关系。

260
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:10,541
我妈妈在上舞蹈课，
我爸爸出差了。

261
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,212
另外我会生气
如果我们今天做不到。

262
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:20,592
太自私了。

263
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:30,060
来的女孩说
一通电话后。

264
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:35,232
快点把它拿出来。

265
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,091
你在开玩笑吧，一条蛇？不，这不对...

266
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:04,470
它就在这附近的某个地方。

267
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:05,679
什么？

268
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,569
-这里是。
-什么？

269
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:54,269
你做这种事吗
和榛名也一样？

270
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:58,524
住口。这不关你的事。

271
00:25:10,494 --> 00:25:11,620
我是去年发现的。

272
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,209
我像今天一样被殴打。
很尴尬，所以我来这里哭了。

273
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:20,838
然后我看到了这个。

274
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,809
-你告诉警察了吗？
-我真的应该，但是...

275
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:42,442
去年秋天前后，
骨头上还有肉。

276
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:29,406
我们去吧。

277
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,343
<i>我...</i>

278
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:53,639
不知道我是死是活……

279
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:57,935
但看着它给了我勇气。

280
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:31,426
不，我会死……

281
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:34,805
我会死...

282
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,582
另一个人知道这件事。

283
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:04,793
谁？

284
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:07,045
吉川小泽。

285
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:10,340
新生？

286
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:14,720
去年年底来的时候，
她已经在这里了。

287
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,015
从那时起，我们有时会聚在一起。

288
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:22,436
也是她的宝物。

289
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:30,861
你做了多久了
这种工作？

290
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,658
也许从我大约三岁开始。

291
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:40,329
一开始我不是模特
我更像一个儿童演员。

292
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:45,208
我做过戏剧之类的事情
和电视广告。

293
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,004
我的父母从事这一行，

294
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:52,883
所以他们问我是否想尝试这样做。

295
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:56,678
但就作品本身而言，

296
00:28:56,762 --> 00:29:01,350
每个人都聚在一起做一件事

297
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:04,770
我认为这很棒。

298
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:09,524
当你做杂志工作时，

299
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:13,195
你和摄影师一起工作
和各种各样的人。

300
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:16,239
而且还有更多优秀的人
当你做电视工作时。

301
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:22,371
但你会感觉到
不一定是你。

302
00:29:22,537 --> 00:29:24,373
任何人都可以做到。

303
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:27,584
你认为任何人都能做到吗？

304
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:34,466
我觉得我看到的时候看起来很恶心
一本杂志或我喜欢的东西。

305
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,514
我想知道他们为什么一直使用我
带着丑陋的脸，

306
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,101
还夸我。

307
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,354
但我不相信他们。

308
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:53,777
我确定真相
是不是他们真的不是这个意思

309
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:59,449
他们只是说
他们认为他们必须说的话。

310
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:06,665
就像他们对自己很满意
因为把丑陋的人称为美丽。

311
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:11,044
<i>学校怎么样？你喜欢吗？</i>

312
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:15,882
<i>与工作相比，学校感觉很真实。</i>

313
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:17,092
<i>正版？</i>

314
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:24,725
不知道学校里的人有没有
按原样称呼事物，

315
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:30,230
但我敢肯定，如果他们认为
有些事情很丑，他们会说出来。

316
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:36,903
他们至少会在你背后说出来。

317
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:42,325
- 你的意思是每个人都是诚实的？
-是的。

318
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:52,335
吉川，你感觉如何？

319
00:30:59,134 --> 00:31:00,886
我会去我的下一堂课。

320
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:09,394
那不行。
你需要有一个均衡的饮食。

321
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:16,610
您的健康先于工作。

322
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:17,986
是的，护士。

323
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:47,182
所以年长的学生也经常逃课。

324
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,109
你有足够的学分吗？

325
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:02,906
我很想念学校的工作，
所以我只有足够的。

326
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,344
哦，看。

327
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:30,350
刚刚扔球的那个。

328
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,103
向中心跑去。

329
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:39,818
是的！

330
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:43,697
那是山田喜欢的人。

331
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:45,532
什么？

332
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:49,035
那个男孩...

333
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:56,251
他是山田的另一宝。

334
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:34,581
<i>我穿着我的海军制服</i>

335
00:33:35,957 --> 00:33:42,964
<i>我是东京巴士女郎</i>

336
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:45,300
-嘿。
-是的？

337
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:49,095
化了妆的老太太
从学校附近的公寓...

338
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:50,221
是的？

339
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:55,852
她擦干她的透视，
在阳台上系上紫色内裤。

340
00:33:56,853 --> 00:34:00,523
那个老太太拿走了樱桃
我们学校的无数男孩。

341
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:01,815
真正的？

342
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:04,152
你为什么不问她？

343
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:06,279
不过，她几岁了？

344
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:09,616
- 之后再问。
-好的。

345
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:11,826
哦，有什么东西在咬人！

346
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:17,874
-你个傻冒。
-拉屎！

347
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:21,711
-你是说？
-正确的。

348
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:25,048
-你知道学校后面的河吗？
-是的？

349
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,465
嗯，那里...

350
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:28,467
打扰一下！

351
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:32,013
嘿！

352
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,723
你有没有听见过？

353
00:34:34,057 --> 00:34:39,103
老人死了，他的钱被埋了，
我们可能...

354
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:41,563
-你在说什么？
-所以无论如何！

355
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:45,275
灌木丛中有一间小屋，
靠近学校后面的河边。

356
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,153
一个老人住在那里，对吧？

357
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,116
他被驱逐了，他搬家了
到不同的公寓，

358
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,534
但他最近去世了。

359
00:34:53,034 --> 00:35:00,000
他死时身无分文，
但他藏了很多钱！

360
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,501
真的吗？

361
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:05,088
你猜怎么着！
钱被埋在灌木丛中！

362
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,007
-灌木丛？
-正确的！

363
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:10,260
千万在灌木丛中！

364
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:13,179
是不是很神奇？

365
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:15,265
一秒钟，我只是...

366
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,519
榛名！

367
00:35:22,897 --> 00:35:24,107
-多少钱？
-140 日元。

368
00:35:34,868 --> 00:35:37,245
吉川在吗？

369
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:38,580
吉川？

370
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:41,291
她之前来过这里，但是……

371
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:45,795
她经常消失。

372
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,008
什么？

373
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,427
一千万！

374
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,137
你能用它做什么？

375
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,306
- 榛名在哪里？
- 她去了某个地方。

376
00:35:57,265 --> 00:35:58,099
正确的。

377
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:00,769
我可以让我的梦想成真！

378
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,938
千万日元！

379
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,250
你为什么把我带到这里来？

380
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,798
我还在生你气。

381
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:31,758
为什么？

382
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:37,931
也许我会把一切都告诉Haruna。

383
00:36:38,515 --> 00:36:39,349
什么？

384
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:43,728
你如何捆绑我的手脚，
蒙住我的眼睛，

385
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:48,233
并粘了一罐慕斯
在我的两个洞里！

386
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:49,859
你这个小...

387
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:52,862
嘿！

388
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,080
我只是在开玩笑。

389
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,169
嘿...

390
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:10,922
我们在这里做吗？

391
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:08,373
-你想要一亿日元吗？
-是的！

392
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:12,710
-你想变得肮脏富有吗？
-是的！

393
00:39:13,044 --> 00:39:16,130
‫ !Money-‬‬
‫ Money-‬‬

394
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:18,424
-真是一群白痴！
‫ !Money-‬‬

395
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:23,888
我只是说有可能
把钱埋在那里。

396
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:26,057
什么？这不是真的？

397
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,228
我妈妈去参加老人的葬礼，

398
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:32,897
她想知道
如果他可能把它埋了。

399
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:33,815
什么？

400
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:35,942
那1.5亿呢？

401
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,611
你从哪里得到那个的？

402
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:41,906
是真的吗，高桥？

403
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:43,700
好吧，我们走吧！

404
00:39:43,783 --> 00:39:46,244
-我们走吧！
-我们走吧！

405
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:52,458
等待！

406
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:54,961
这不是真的！

407
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:57,088
嘿！

408
00:39:57,755 --> 00:39:59,966
钱是骗人的！

409
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:01,217
这是一个谎言！

410
00:40:01,676 --> 00:40:03,636
这是一个谎言！嘿！

411
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,181
这不是真的！嘿！

412
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:08,933
榛名！

413
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:13,646
你要去哪里？

414
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:18,401
那些小混混。

415
00:40:20,236 --> 00:40:23,239
嘿。你要去哪里？

416
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:26,200
-来吧。
-嘿。

417
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:50,224
<i>我会告诉你我的秘密宝藏。</i>

418
00:40:55,563 --> 00:40:56,397
对不起。

419
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:10,203
我以为这真的很适合你。

420
00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:13,748
你看起来像一个蓝色的人。

421
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,918
我什么都没给你
为了你的生日。

422
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:19,420
我们十二月才开始约会，

423
00:41:19,504 --> 00:41:21,506
你的生日在三月。

424
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:23,883
谢谢你。

425
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:27,428
你想去吗
去八景岛的水族馆？

426
00:41:27,512 --> 00:41:29,180
我还没有去过那里。

427
00:41:29,263 --> 00:41:30,348
当然。

428
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:33,017
我给我们做午饭。我们什么时候去？

429
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:34,852
-星期天呢？
-好的。

430
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:37,605
你想要什么午餐？

431
00:41:37,688 --> 00:41:41,651
三明治、饭团还是百吉饼？

432
00:41:41,943 --> 00:41:42,985
什么都好。

433
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:47,573
发现什么就喊！我们走吧！

434
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:53,204
他们在做什么？

435
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:59,669
我不是很确定，但每个人
说有什么东西被埋了……

436
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:01,212
山田？

437
00:42:02,296 --> 00:42:04,507
嘿！不要那么做！

438
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,550
山田！

439
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:07,385
嘿！

440
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:10,596
-山田！
-下车！

441
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,140
停下来！

442
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:13,641
停下来！

443
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:15,309
停止！

444
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:23,860
有人！

445
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:25,236
有人！

446
00:42:45,423 --> 00:42:47,341
你他妈是谁？

447
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:50,261
你个狗屎！

448
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:03,691
-让我们收工。
-我们将在早上继续。

449
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,315
你还好吗？

450
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,422
晚上。

451
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:11,842
晚上。

452
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:13,970
这已经失控了。

453
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:16,055
正确的。

454
00:44:33,114 --> 00:44:33,948
我们走吧。

455
00:44:54,802 --> 00:44:56,387
他出去了？

456
00:44:58,472 --> 00:44:59,682
好的。

457
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,025
哦，我叫田岛。

458
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:10,818
不。

459
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:17,158
山田受伤了，我很担心。

460
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:22,496
是的。

461
00:45:24,665 --> 00:45:25,833
再见。

462
00:45:59,742 --> 00:46:00,826
没关系。

463
00:46:03,454 --> 00:46:04,497
你得到那个结果。

464
00:46:15,341 --> 00:46:16,425
若草？

465
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,844
哦是的。

466
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:27,603
我们将无法再看它。

467
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:29,188
我们别无选择。

468
00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:32,024
我宁愿那样也不愿拥有它们
把它当作玩具。

469
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:34,610
准备好，举起。

470
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,658
让我们尽可能深入地挖掘。

471
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:42,660
如果它很浅，他们会找到它。

472
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:44,161
正确的。

473
00:47:01,053 --> 00:47:01,887
对不起...

474
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:04,765
我的胳膊和腿都在痛。

475
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:12,106
暂停。我需要抽烟。

476
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:23,033
给我一个，若草。

477
00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:51,437
嘿...

478
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:56,025
你看到的时候在想什么？

479
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,745
我不太确定。

480
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,250
我想...

481
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:17,087
“它对你有用。”

482
00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:21,425
“它对你有用。”

483
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:25,179
是的，“它对你有用。”

484
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:29,475
人们假装美丽，

485
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:31,352
假装好看，

486
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:34,063
并假装玩得很开心。

487
00:48:35,272 --> 00:48:36,774
这让我感到恶心。

488
00:48:39,151 --> 00:48:40,653
我自己可能没有，

489
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,073
但你们也没有出路。

490
00:48:46,534 --> 00:48:47,952
所以它为你服务。

491
00:48:57,836 --> 00:48:59,088
我也那么认为。

492
00:49:07,304 --> 00:49:08,138
让我们把它埋起来。

493
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:11,225
好的。

494
00:49:49,513 --> 00:49:50,347
我们走吧。

495
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:20,002
很美丽！

496
00:50:21,295 --> 00:50:23,422
我爱鱼！

497
00:50:29,094 --> 00:50:30,179
噢！嗨。

498
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:32,723
有时间去江之岛水族馆好吗？

499
00:50:32,806 --> 00:50:34,808
他们有很多水母！

500
00:50:34,892 --> 00:50:38,729
它们是透明的，非常漂亮。

501
00:50:40,272 --> 00:50:41,982
它们看起来像褶边连衣裙！

502
00:50:58,749 --> 00:51:00,042
榛名...

503
00:51:02,503 --> 00:51:04,129
哦，<i>Kiteretsu</i>！

504
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:08,300
我的初吻！

505
00:51:11,845 --> 00:51:13,722
<i>摇摇晃晃的果冻！</i>

506
00:51:15,432 --> 00:51:16,934
不是我们学校的吉川吗？

507
00:51:17,935 --> 00:51:19,937
<i>摇摇晃晃，摇摇晃晃</i>

508
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,147
我敢打赌她为此赚了一些钱。

509
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:24,274
非常好。

510
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:26,276
<i>摇摇晃晃的果冻！</i>

511
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:29,863
事情没那么简单。

512
00:51:31,782 --> 00:51:33,826
模特只需要好身材。

513
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,494
这不公平。

514
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:38,539
<i>很好吃！</i>

515
00:51:39,998 --> 00:51:40,999
<i>嫁给我吧！</i>

516
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:43,335
<i>是的。</i>

517
00:51:44,044 --> 00:51:46,213
你很幸运，观音崎。

518
00:51:47,464 --> 00:51:48,298
什么？

519
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:50,801
你好像没有
世界上的一种关怀。

520
00:51:52,261 --> 00:51:53,137
是的。

521
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,062
<i>Kiteretsu</i> 完成后我们再去吧。

522
00:52:02,146 --> 00:52:03,731
严重地？你不留下来？

523
00:52:04,314 --> 00:52:05,649
我不是。

524
00:52:10,738 --> 00:52:12,322
对不起，我以后有计划。

525
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:13,657
好的。

526
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:15,617
那么明天见。

527
00:52:17,536 --> 00:52:18,912
午餐很好吃。

528
00:52:19,538 --> 00:52:20,956
谢谢你，我玩得很开心。

529
00:56:44,511 --> 00:56:45,470
害怕。

530
00:57:16,335 --> 00:57:18,128
你在吗。

531
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:22,883
你会停止服用吗
我们拥有的每一盒牛奶？

532
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:25,552
你在做什么？你不能先敲门吗？

533
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:32,893
这就是剩下的吗？

534
00:57:32,976 --> 00:57:34,728
我想做布丁。

535
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:37,814
出去！不要只是进来！

536
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:43,904
我会的，如果你停止进入我的房间。

537
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:48,158
我知道你这样做。

538
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:53,538
如果你再碰我的日记，
我会让妈妈把门锁上。

539
00:57:54,998 --> 00:57:57,042
哦，还有一件事。

540
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,711
你会停止穿我的衣服吗
不问我？

541
00:57:59,795 --> 00:58:01,254
它伸展它们。

542
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:24,736
山田。

543
00:58:27,989 --> 00:58:28,990
它是什么？

544
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:31,368
我想我会给猫一些牛奶。

545
00:58:33,036 --> 00:58:34,204
你有课吗？

546
00:58:34,788 --> 00:58:36,373
-我跳过了。
-好的。

547
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:41,753
他们长大了。

548
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:43,046
是的。

549
00:58:44,131 --> 00:58:46,633
他们看起来像小老鼠
当你第一次找到它们时。

550
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:51,346
这里。

551
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,564
他很贪婪。

552
00:59:21,543 --> 00:59:22,419
然后再次！

553
00:59:23,587 --> 00:59:24,921
大部头书！

554
00:59:34,347 --> 00:59:36,766
你喜欢他，对吧？

555
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:40,979
你怎么知道？

556
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:43,190
吉川告诉我。

557
00:59:46,526 --> 00:59:48,445
是的，我愿意。

558
00:59:54,993 --> 00:59:58,538
你不想告诉他你喜欢他吗？

559
00:59:58,747 --> 00:59:59,664
我愿意。

560
01:00:00,415 --> 01:00:03,376
还是你想让他抱你？

561
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,753
-是的。
-来吻你？

562
01:00:04,836 --> 01:00:06,129
-当然。
- 和性？

563
01:00:06,213 --> 01:00:07,631
我真的很想。

564
01:00:13,303 --> 01:00:16,848
是拿还是给，山田？

565
01:00:17,474 --> 01:00:20,101
你怎么决定什么时候是两个男人？

566
01:00:22,187 --> 01:00:23,730
进去的时候不疼吗？

567
01:00:24,439 --> 01:00:26,858
我猜你像书中那样使用润滑油？

568
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:32,239
你喜欢有你的阴蒂吗
舔或手指？

569
01:00:32,822 --> 01:00:34,032
什么？

570
01:00:35,575 --> 01:00:37,410
你吐还是吞？

571
01:00:42,249 --> 01:00:45,752
问我关于性的问题很不礼貌
只是因为我是同性恋。

572
01:00:51,383 --> 01:00:52,217
对不起。

573
01:00:53,843 --> 01:00:55,512
不，没关系。

574
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,933
而不是那些东西...

575
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:03,478
只要和他在一起就足够了。

576
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,066
他在那里。

577
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:09,609
我在那里。

578
01:01:12,445 --> 01:01:14,364
我可以看到他。

579
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:19,452
那就足够了。

580
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:23,123
<i>当天听到</i>

581
01:01:23,206 --> 01:01:28,253
<i>被月光迷住了
都过世了</i>

582
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:33,466
<i>美丽的梦想家，我的歌后</i>

583
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:38,722
<i>当我用柔和的旋律向你求爱时列出来</i>

584
01:01:41,683 --> 01:01:47,105
<i>生活忙碌的人群的烦恼已经一去不复返了</i>

585
01:01:47,188 --> 01:01:52,360
<i>美丽的梦想家，醒醒我</i>

586
01:01:53,153 --> 01:02:00,160
<i>美丽的梦想家，醒醒我</i>

587
01:02:14,215 --> 01:02:15,258
它是什么？

588
01:02:18,845 --> 01:02:20,221
今天来我家。

589
01:02:26,436 --> 01:02:27,604
你怎么了？

590
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,148
你有东西吗？

591
01:02:31,316 --> 01:02:32,150
不。

592
01:02:35,403 --> 01:02:36,529
那我就不来了

593
01:02:36,613 --> 01:02:38,823
不要说那样的话。

594
01:02:42,994 --> 01:02:45,330
春菜不给你吗？

595
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,713
什么？

596
01:03:00,595 --> 01:03:01,429
嘿。

597
01:03:02,555 --> 01:03:04,516
我的月经来晚了。

598
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:09,979
你会怎么做？

599
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,494
你是怎么认识的
你38岁的男朋友？

600
01:03:28,164 --> 01:03:29,999
一位朋友介绍我们。

601
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:32,919
一个朋友？

602
01:03:33,878 --> 01:03:37,090
是的，我在某个俱乐部遇到的人。

603
01:03:43,221 --> 01:03:44,889
<i>你喜欢他什么？</i>

604
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:50,353
<i>他的钱。</i>

605
01:03:52,897 --> 01:03:55,024
你父母知道他吗？

606
01:03:55,108 --> 01:03:56,276
不，他们没有！

607
01:03:57,193 --> 01:04:00,655
毕竟，他已经 38 岁了，已经结婚了。

608
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:03,158
我不可能把他介绍给他们。

609
01:04:05,285 --> 01:04:07,912
我的父母信任我。

610
01:04:10,206 --> 01:04:14,794
你什么时候有意识
你的身体？

611
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:19,966
<i>当我做爱时。</i>

612
01:04:22,135 --> 01:04:25,388
爱对你意味着什么？

613
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:41,946
爱？

614
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:15,355
宫下，避孕套。中村，进来了。
神野崎，进来了。荣介，避孕套。

615
01:05:15,438 --> 01:05:17,649
野口，不记得了。
涩谷哥们，避孕套。

616
01:05:17,732 --> 01:05:20,026
池袋俱乐部老兄，进来了。
吉川，避孕套。

617
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,122
鲁米！

618
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:35,375
去洗澡吧！

619
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:37,377
好的！

620
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,091
哈鲁纳，回答吧！

621
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:16,249
什么？

622
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:17,792
接电话！

623
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:19,210
好的！

624
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:25,425
你好，若草宅邸。

625
01:06:30,138 --> 01:06:31,890
你好？

626
01:06:34,017 --> 01:06:35,018
发生了什么？

627
01:06:42,275 --> 01:06:43,151
他们挂断了电话。

628
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:44,944
-好吃吗？
-是的。

629
01:06:49,407 --> 01:06:51,492
我很高兴！

630
01:06:52,035 --> 01:06:53,620
-我可以再给你做点什么吗？
-是的。

631
01:06:53,745 --> 01:06:55,747
别担心，我喜欢做饭。

632
01:06:56,664 --> 01:06:58,917
-你喜欢什么？
-任何。

633
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,585
嘿，我们吃午饭好吗
再去水族馆？

634
01:07:02,462 --> 01:07:05,548
是的。

635
01:07:05,632 --> 01:07:06,466
我之前买了一张CD
我以为你会喜欢的。

636
01:07:08,426 --> 01:07:12,138
我借给你！

637
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:13,222
我还买了一些蓝色羊毛。

638
01:07:13,431 --> 01:07:15,516
这绝对是美丽的。

639
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,436
我以为我会给你织一件毛衣。
我觉得蓝色适合你。

640
01:07:18,519 --> 01:07:23,483
你喜欢蓝色吗？你可以穿
我们可以去约会。

641
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:26,653
我们应该去哪里？

642
01:07:26,736 --> 01:07:28,029
我想去现场看Original Love。

643
01:07:28,112 --> 01:07:31,407
他们即将举行一场演出
在涩谷俱乐部 Quattro。

644
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:33,993
希望我们能买到票！

645
01:07:34,077 --> 01:07:35,912
还有一个有趣的展览
在大森的那个美术馆。

646
01:07:35,995 --> 01:07:41,584
我很想一起去那里！

647
01:07:41,668 --> 01:07:43,962
-然后有--
-住口！

648
01:07:44,045 --> 01:07:45,880
山田？

649
01:07:47,632 --> 01:07:49,258
你喜欢谈论毫无意义的废话吗？

650
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:53,304
关于你想让我做的事情？

651
01:07:53,388 --> 01:07:55,848
你喜欢谈论
除了你自己什么都没有？

652
01:07:55,932 --> 01:07:58,184
我去了灌木丛，
但有些不同。

653
01:08:28,464 --> 01:08:30,550
虽然现在一切都很平静。

654
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:33,594
有什么事吗？

655
01:08:37,724 --> 01:08:38,850
没什么。

656
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:40,852
好的。

657
01:08:45,105 --> 01:08:45,939
-若草。
-是的？

658
01:08:56,283 --> 01:08:57,743
让我们试着叫一个不明飞行物。

659
01:09:09,005 --> 01:09:10,715
我以前做过，只有一次。

660
01:09:21,893 --> 01:09:23,603
我该怎么做？

661
01:09:28,816 --> 01:09:30,026
在你的脑海里做。

662
01:09:35,073 --> 01:09:36,282
它冻结！

663
01:10:05,895 --> 01:10:07,230
-我知道，对吧？
-我的边缘很奇怪吗？

664
01:10:07,313 --> 01:10:09,107
-不，还好。
-谢谢。

665
01:10:09,982 --> 01:10:12,068
鲁米！

666
01:10:20,743 --> 01:10:21,828
-你好！
-早晨！

667
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:24,789
你现在好吗？

668
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:25,957
你走了三天，
我们很担心！

669
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,459
今年的感冒真的拖了。

670
01:10:28,543 --> 01:10:30,378
-我很高兴你变得更好了。
-一封信！

671
01:10:30,461 --> 01:10:32,380
-什么？
-什么？

672
01:10:32,463 --> 01:10:33,714
- 一封情书？
-是谁寄来的？

673
01:10:34,882 --> 01:10:37,260
不说。

674
01:10:37,969 --> 01:10:38,803
打开它！

675
01:10:38,886 --> 01:10:40,388
是谁？我等不及了！

676
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:42,807
你最好死了

677
01:10:47,103 --> 01:10:53,276
你最好死了

678
01:10:55,945 --> 01:10:57,446
多么令人毛骨悚然。

679
01:10:58,447 --> 01:10:59,991
忘掉它！

680
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:07,415
-榛名！早晨！
-早晨。

681
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:13,462
你现在还好吗，小山？

682
01:11:13,713 --> 01:11:14,547
是的。

683
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,759
嘿，哈鲁娜。
你觉得我应该理发吗？

684
01:11:18,843 --> 01:11:21,262
-或者我应该把它长出来吗？
-我不在乎。

685
01:11:21,345 --> 01:11:23,431
-我应该怎么办？
-任何！

686
01:11:23,514 --> 01:11:25,433
-哪一个？
-移动。

687
01:11:25,516 --> 01:11:26,976
-哪个？
-已经足够！

688
01:11:27,059 --> 01:11:29,228
-哪个更好？
-我不在乎！

689
01:11:34,192 --> 01:11:36,235
你逃课了。

690
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:38,279
经期痛。

691
01:11:40,865 --> 01:11:42,575
只是在开玩笑。

692
01:11:44,744 --> 01:11:46,537
来这里一分钟。

693
01:11:46,621 --> 01:11:48,873
-我发现了一些有趣的东西。
-什么？

694
01:11:48,956 --> 01:11:49,916
你会看到的，加油！

695
01:11:52,668 --> 01:11:54,420
-一秒。
-没关系。

696
01:11:54,503 --> 01:11:55,546
嘿！

697
01:11:59,675 --> 01:12:00,718
吉川！

698
01:12:00,801 --> 01:12:02,345
若草！

699
01:12:04,555 --> 01:12:05,890
-这边走！
-它是什么？

700
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:08,601
什么？它是什么？

701
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:10,144
在那边。

702
01:12:18,069 --> 01:12:18,903
这里。

703
01:12:20,446 --> 01:12:21,489
看一看。

704
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:26,661
这不是疯了吗？

705
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:29,580
我觉得是猫什么的。

706
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,500
看起来像肉丸子！

707
01:13:19,588 --> 01:13:21,799
对不起，若草。

708
01:13:24,635 --> 01:13:26,178
我不是故意的。

709
01:13:31,142 --> 01:13:31,976
嘿。

710
01:13:32,977 --> 01:13:33,978
对不起。

711
01:13:36,772 --> 01:13:38,274
请不要哭泣。

712
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:41,777
对不起。

713
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:52,747
好听又好听！

714
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:55,958
三，四，五，六，

715
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:57,585
七八...

716
01:14:03,883 --> 01:14:05,384
多么美丽的颜色！

717
01:14:05,468 --> 01:14:06,594
是礼物吗？

718
01:14:06,677 --> 01:14:08,929
山田喜欢蓝色。

719
01:14:10,473 --> 01:14:11,891
太好了！

720
01:14:11,974 --> 01:14:16,228
他没有闭嘴
要我给他织毛衣！

721
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:21,442
-太好了！
-我羡慕你！

722
01:14:21,525 --> 01:14:24,612
- 你可以织毛衣，太酷了！
-你真的很棒！

723
01:14:24,695 --> 01:14:27,323
——那真的很适合他！
-正确的！

724
01:14:27,406 --> 01:14:29,492
它真可爱！

725
01:14:29,575 --> 01:14:31,410
多么可爱！

726
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:37,708
这是怎么回事？它冻结。

727
01:14:38,834 --> 01:14:40,586
如果我们在室内，你会操我的。

728
01:14:42,296 --> 01:14:44,256
或者你不介意在外面？

729
01:14:44,632 --> 01:14:45,674
这意味着什么？

730
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:49,261
你所想的只是性。

731
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:52,973
我问你有没有
之前的东西，对吧？

732
01:14:53,557 --> 01:14:55,184
你在说什么？

733
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:01,941
给我钱。

734
01:15:03,067 --> 01:15:03,901
什么？

735
01:15:04,819 --> 01:15:05,903
对于操作。

736
01:15:10,908 --> 01:15:11,742
多少钱？

737
01:15:12,993 --> 01:15:13,953
这是150,000。

738
01:15:14,203 --> 01:15:15,287
什么？

739
01:15:15,663 --> 01:15:17,706
没办法花那么多钱。

740
01:15:18,874 --> 01:15:20,000
嗯，确实如此。

741
01:15:21,335 --> 01:15:22,628
真的是我的吗？

742
01:15:25,089 --> 01:15:27,049
为什么不使用保护？

743
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:32,763
不只是在我们高高在上的时候，
你根本没用过！

744
01:15:39,437 --> 01:15:41,272
即使你和榛名一起使用！

745
01:15:48,904 --> 01:15:50,489
我没有那种钱。

746
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:53,284
你说你会得到现金的东西。

747
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:54,577
我已经用完了。

748
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:57,705
但你还有钱
给榛名买礼物？

749
01:16:07,423 --> 01:16:08,591
好的。

750
01:16:09,967 --> 01:16:11,469
但我不能给你全部。

751
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,978
哈鲁纳根本不喜欢你。

752
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:23,856
你是什么意思？

753
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:25,649
她告诉我。

754
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,071
“我一点也不喜欢观音崎。
他是个笨蛋。

755
01:16:31,155 --> 01:16:32,948
他生气了
当我不让他操我的时候。”

756
01:16:37,244 --> 01:16:39,747
我也不喜欢你。

757
01:16:40,164 --> 01:16:41,040
闭上你的嘴。

758
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:47,171
甚至你的父母
不在乎你，对吧？

759
01:16:47,254 --> 01:16:49,423
- 他们完全忽视了你！
-停下来。

760
01:16:49,965 --> 01:16:53,886
-你能做什么？你什么都不是。
-停下来。

761
01:16:53,969 --> 01:16:57,848
你是一坨屎，欺负小偷
谁操他女朋友的朋友！

762
01:16:57,932 --> 01:16:59,767
那小子的父亲又是谁？

763
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,310
你就是一坨屎！

764
01:17:05,356 --> 01:17:06,941
又是暴力！

765
01:17:07,566 --> 01:17:10,194
因为没人喜欢你！

766
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:13,197
-因为没有人爱你！
-停下来！

767
01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:17,952
你的感情受伤了吗？

768
01:17:18,619 --> 01:17:20,037
真是个笨蛋！

769
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:35,427
停下来...

770
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:37,096
停下来...

771
01:17:37,638 --> 01:17:38,931
停下来...

772
01:17:39,014 --> 01:17:41,016
停下来...

773
01:17:41,392 --> 01:17:43,644
停下来...

774
01:17:50,401 --> 01:17:51,235
极好的。

775
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:54,780
这是我妈妈的爱好。
它看起来像一个情人酒店。

776
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:58,617
-你饿了吗？
-哦是的。

777
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:08,002
我点了一些食物。

778
01:18:11,922 --> 01:18:12,756
坐下。

779
01:18:20,514 --> 01:18:22,391
-你想喝点酒吗？
-是的。

780
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,568
我可能要退学了。

781
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:34,737
真的吗？

782
01:18:36,363 --> 01:18:37,239
是的。

783
01:18:39,116 --> 01:18:41,452
我要成为常客
在三个电视节目中。

784
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:45,247
大一的时候我很努力，
但大二可能没那么好。

785
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:49,001
我想上大学。

786
01:19:07,144 --> 01:19:08,812
这一切我都吃不完。

787
01:19:09,146 --> 01:19:11,315
别担心，我会的。

788
01:19:12,358 --> 01:19:13,525
你在开玩笑么。

789
01:19:14,693 --> 01:19:18,113
没关系。反正以后我会扔的。

790
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:35,107
你想喝咖啡吗？

791
01:20:36,233 --> 01:20:37,067
当然。

792
01:20:40,821 --> 01:20:41,822
谢谢。

793
01:20:45,492 --> 01:20:49,037
你现在恨我吗，若草？

794
01:20:54,918 --> 01:20:56,336
一点也不。

795
01:21:04,428 --> 01:21:08,098
我喜欢你，若草。

796
01:21:43,884 --> 01:21:45,552
我们会在便利店买手套。

797
01:21:50,766 --> 01:21:52,059
不要告诉任何人！

798
01:21:52,142 --> 01:21:52,976
任何人！

799
01:21:53,393 --> 01:21:55,604
-如果你这样做，我会杀了你。
-你会怎么做？

800
01:21:56,814 --> 01:21:57,898
来吧，我们走吧。

801
01:21:57,981 --> 01:21:59,983
埋葬一个人需要很长时间。

802
01:22:02,653 --> 01:22:03,529
哦是的。

803
01:22:03,946 --> 01:22:05,989
-我再叫两个人。
-什么？

804
01:22:06,156 --> 01:22:08,617
我们以前一起挖过，
所以它是完美的。

805
01:22:09,368 --> 01:22:10,244
谁？

806
01:22:11,453 --> 01:22:13,080
若草和吉川。

807
01:22:13,914 --> 01:22:15,833
你和春菜怎么了？

808
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:17,751
没有什么。

809
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:20,212
我对女孩没有性兴趣。

810
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:25,759
而且您不必担心
和我在一起。我恨你。

811
01:22:37,396 --> 01:22:38,230
好的。

812
01:22:39,523 --> 01:22:41,733
好的。好，知道了。

813
01:22:57,708 --> 01:22:58,542
它是什么？

814
01:22:59,126 --> 01:23:00,127
是山田。

815
01:23:01,837 --> 01:23:04,006
他说他发现了一具新的尸体！

816
01:23:04,798 --> 01:23:06,717
他要我们现在去看
在他埋葬之前。

817
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:10,012
你是什么意思？

818
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:54,306
不得擅自闯入

819
01:25:27,149 --> 01:25:28,316
你在做什么？

820
01:25:30,569 --> 01:25:32,779
那不是你要看的！

821
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,948


822
01:25:35,032 --> 01:25:36,366
你沮丧，丑陋的婊子！

823
01:25:37,576 --> 01:25:39,661
你都干了什么？

824
01:25:40,037 --> 01:25:41,830
你真是个白痴！

825
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:44,249
一个不知道父亲是谁的孩子？

826
01:25:44,624 --> 01:25:47,002
你会怎么做？

827
01:25:47,252 --> 01:25:50,547
“我仅仅因为做爱一次就得到了50,000。”

828
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:53,467
那是卖淫！

829
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:55,927
这不关你的事！

830
01:25:56,094 --> 01:25:57,846
闭嘴，猪！

831
01:25:57,929 --> 01:25:59,473
滚开，你这个丑陋的婊子！

832
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:01,892
别再写你的同性恋漫画了！

833
01:26:01,975 --> 01:26:03,935
试着给自己找个男朋友！

834
01:26:04,019 --> 01:26:05,228
减肥吧，胖子！

835
01:26:05,687 --> 01:26:06,855
你个猪！

836
01:26:42,516 --> 01:26:44,059
死！

837
01:26:44,184 --> 01:26:45,977
死！

838
01:26:46,269 --> 01:26:49,564
死！

839
01:26:51,274 --> 01:26:52,526
嘿！

840
01:26:54,444 --> 01:26:56,363
这是怎么回事？你声音太大了...

841
01:27:40,866 --> 01:27:42,951
榛名！

842
01:27:43,034 --> 01:27:46,371
榛名！

843
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:50,625
它在哪里？

844
01:27:52,377 --> 01:27:54,546
- 它在某处发生了。
-什么？

845
01:27:54,796 --> 01:27:56,173
一分钟前就在这里。

846
01:27:57,007 --> 01:27:58,049
我懂了。

847
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,801
太糟糕了。

848
01:28:00,844 --> 01:28:02,804
对不起。那是不对的。

849
01:28:02,888 --> 01:28:04,556
小山和我不是这样的。

850
01:28:06,641 --> 01:28:08,518
我很抱歉！

851
01:28:08,602 --> 01:28:09,769
对不起！

852
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:23,450
你好。

853
01:28:24,951 --> 01:28:26,703
一郎在家吗？

854
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:33,627
好的，我明白了。

855
01:28:41,176 --> 01:28:42,093
你好。

856
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:44,596
哈鲁娜在吗？

857
01:28:59,945 --> 01:29:05,158
死。

858
01:29:11,498 --> 01:29:12,499
对不起。

859
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:15,794
我们走吧。

860
01:29:17,003 --> 01:29:18,213
若草。

861
01:29:26,888 --> 01:29:28,515
你们两个怎么了？

862
01:29:30,183 --> 01:29:31,685
这是一种什么样的关系？

863
01:29:32,727 --> 01:29:33,687
哪一种...

864
01:29:36,982 --> 01:29:39,901
——当然不是你和山田？
-我告诉过你我们不是！

865
01:29:39,985 --> 01:29:41,569
然后呢？

866
01:29:51,913 --> 01:29:54,332
不要取笑我，山田！

867
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:57,585
-如果你不在身边的话……
——住手，观音崎！

868
01:29:57,669 --> 01:30:00,880
你是我比谁都喜欢的人！

869
01:30:00,964 --> 01:30:05,218
对不起，我不能说
直到现在。对不起！

870
01:30:05,301 --> 01:30:07,387
-我不会再让你一个人了！
-榛名！

871
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,639
-榛名！
-对不起！

872
01:30:10,306 --> 01:30:11,474
对不起！

873
01:30:26,448 --> 01:30:27,782
让我们把白痴留在这里。

874
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:31,870
但是若草呢？

875
01:30:50,972 --> 01:30:53,433
她会没事的。

876
01:30:54,684 --> 01:30:57,062
这与她无关。

877
01:30:58,271 --> 01:30:59,647
所以她会没事的。

878
01:31:07,155 --> 01:31:10,158
这是若草的。

879
01:31:11,826 --> 01:31:13,328
从我们挖那个洞开始。

880
01:31:48,905 --> 01:31:51,074
榛名！

881
01:31:51,241 --> 01:31:54,953
榛名...

882
01:31:58,039 --> 01:32:02,168
榛名...

883
01:33:27,962 --> 01:33:30,548
你和山田约会多久了？

884
01:33:30,965 --> 01:33:32,550
从去年12月开始。

885
01:33:33,885 --> 01:33:37,889
我喜欢使用过的小泽
在鳍状肢的吉他。

886
01:33:39,974 --> 01:33:44,145
我在听他的第一张个人专辑
在涩谷HMV，

887
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:48,983
山田就在附近，
也在听。

888
01:33:49,651 --> 01:33:52,153
我知道他是谁，

889
01:33:53,446 --> 01:33:56,616
但我们在不同的班级，

890
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,788
但我以为他有
这么漂亮的脸。

891
01:34:02,372 --> 01:34:05,208
山田有一些特别之处。

892
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:10,213
他穿得这么好，
他有一种神秘的气息，

893
01:34:10,296 --> 01:34:15,301
他只是有点不同
来自其他粗鲁的男孩。

894
01:34:16,052 --> 01:34:21,349
但我认为这将是一个错误
在学校和他说话，

895
01:34:22,225 --> 01:34:24,894
所以我想我会在那里和他谈谈。

896
01:34:24,978 --> 01:34:29,107
我们直接去了一家咖啡馆
一起在西班牙-坂上，

897
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:33,569
从那里我开始
借给他各种CD。

898
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:37,073
然后，在圣诞节，

899
01:34:37,949 --> 01:34:40,952
我鼓起勇气
求他做我男朋友

900
01:34:42,036 --> 01:34:43,788
他只是说“好吧”！

901
01:34:44,872 --> 01:34:47,792
我真的不敢相信

902
01:34:48,751 --> 01:34:50,962
它已经发生了。

903
01:34:51,045 --> 01:34:53,089
我非常开心。

904
01:34:54,215 --> 01:34:55,925
现在你很幸福，对吧？

905
01:34:56,092 --> 01:34:57,885
我是。

906
01:34:58,469 --> 01:34:59,679
非常开心。

907
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:03,933
出色地...

908
01:35:04,559 --> 01:35:08,521
你有没有想过自己
你活着开心吗？

909
01:35:11,107 --> 01:35:12,900
我很高兴还活着。

910
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:30,626
我很高兴还活着。

911
01:35:57,111 --> 01:36:01,032
<i>落在富士山上的雪</i>

912
01:36:01,783 --> 01:36:05,995
<i>还有飘落的雪
京都先斗町</i>

913
01:36:06,371 --> 01:36:10,249
<i>它们都是一样的雪，不是吗？</i>

914
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:14,754
<i>解冻后，每个人都一样</i>

915
01:36:14,921 --> 01:36:16,964
-嘿。
-是的？

916
01:36:18,091 --> 01:36:21,177
发生了很多疯狂的事情
最近在学校，不是吗？

917
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,261
当然有。

918
01:36:22,887 --> 01:36:25,264
你知道，那是因为在江户时代，

919
01:36:26,057 --> 01:36:27,975
他们曾经在那里处决人。

920
01:36:28,059 --> 01:36:29,185
真正的？

921
01:36:29,811 --> 01:36:32,605
而且，最近才看到。

922
01:36:33,064 --> 01:36:33,898
有什么？

923
01:36:35,024 --> 01:36:36,734
田岛环奈的鬼魂。

924
01:36:37,151 --> 01:36:38,403
这不好笑。

925
01:36:39,654 --> 01:36:41,406
那太疯狂了。

926
01:36:41,906 --> 01:36:44,367
我敢打赌她正试图设置
若草的公寓着火了。

927
01:36:44,534 --> 01:36:46,953
然后她就火了！

928
01:36:49,247 --> 01:36:50,331
是山田的错。

929
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,583
山田疯了，不是吗？

930
01:36:53,334 --> 01:36:54,752
他是。

931
01:36:57,213 --> 01:36:58,256
天哪。

932
01:36:58,464 --> 01:36:59,590
他吓到我了。

933
01:38:09,994 --> 01:38:12,038
鲁米生了一个孩子。

934
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:16,584
是的。

935
01:38:18,544 --> 01:38:20,713
我也不知道她有一个姐姐。

936
01:38:24,926 --> 01:38:25,760
正确的。

937
01:38:29,514 --> 01:38:31,641
我不认为我们可以
做过什么...

938
01:38:34,143 --> 01:38:35,436
但我希望她告诉我们。

939
01:38:43,486 --> 01:38:45,196
你真的动了吗？

940
01:38:47,323 --> 01:38:48,157
是的。

941
01:38:50,826 --> 01:38:52,870
我妈说很难
住在公寓楼里。

942
01:38:56,874 --> 01:38:58,501
我的房间被烧得焦黑。

943
01:39:00,336 --> 01:39:01,504
我懂了。

944
01:39:02,672 --> 01:39:03,798
好的。

945
01:39:58,019 --> 01:39:59,145
榛名！

946
01:40:00,271 --> 01:40:02,523
一会儿我们喝杯咖啡好吗？

947
01:40:02,857 --> 01:40:03,774
当然。

948
01:40:05,818 --> 01:40:08,154
我们的行李比我预期的要多。

949
01:40:10,906 --> 01:40:12,158
我没有多少。

950
01:40:13,618 --> 01:40:16,037
那是因为我们扔了
灭火器出来。

951
01:40:18,789 --> 01:40:21,584
我还没有还清转盘。

952
01:40:23,336 --> 01:40:24,795
你能做什么？

953
01:40:28,633 --> 01:40:29,592
是的！

954
01:40:34,096 --> 01:40:36,766
-你好！我是来帮忙的。
-好的。

955
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:45,941
嘿。

956
01:40:47,902 --> 01:40:48,736
嘿。

957
01:40:51,739 --> 01:40:53,407
你对小镇有什么依恋吗？

958
01:41:01,582 --> 01:41:02,667
我不确定。

959
01:41:04,502 --> 01:41:07,254
你和观音崎怎么了？

960
01:41:09,799 --> 01:41:11,384
我想我再也见不到他了。

961
01:41:12,593 --> 01:41:17,723
我想我一走，他就会松一口气。

962
01:41:42,456 --> 01:41:43,916
你是救生员！

963
01:41:44,542 --> 01:41:46,419
-保持！
-你说对了！

964
01:41:54,885 --> 01:41:56,470
<i>你觉得难过吗？</i>

965
01:41:57,138 --> 01:41:58,556
你说的“悲伤”是什么意思？

966
01:42:00,391 --> 01:42:03,728
就像你失去了什么
对你来说很珍贵。

967
01:42:09,275 --> 01:42:14,155
那么我想我并不难过，我想。

968
01:42:16,574 --> 01:42:19,368
你觉得你还活着吗？

969
01:42:28,002 --> 01:42:29,587
如果我不得不说...

970
01:42:31,881 --> 01:42:33,215
我不觉得活着。

971
01:42:34,341 --> 01:42:35,760
你是什么意思？

972
01:42:36,302 --> 01:42:37,678
因为我不改变。

973
01:42:38,179 --> 01:42:39,138
你不改？

974
01:42:39,346 --> 01:42:41,766
是的，就像一块石头……

975
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:44,685
或塑料。

976
01:42:45,644 --> 01:42:48,856
我想我和他们一样
因为我变化不大。

977
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:54,320
那么你认为活着意味着什么？

978
01:43:12,171 --> 01:43:15,508
感觉的东西，我想。

979
01:43:19,303 --> 01:43:23,098
感受温暖事物的温暖，

980
01:43:23,682 --> 01:43:25,726
或者冰冷事物的冰冷……

981
01:43:27,061 --> 01:43:28,813
这就是我认为的。

982
01:43:33,859 --> 01:43:34,902
最近...

983
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:40,741
有一天
发生了很多事情。

984
01:43:54,588 --> 01:43:56,674
田岛环奈死了……

985
01:43:59,468 --> 01:44:00,678
还有鲁米……

986
01:44:01,929 --> 01:44:02,930
丢失的

987
01:44:04,265 --> 01:44:05,599
她的宝贝。

988
01:44:07,935 --> 01:44:11,230
不知道合适不...

989
01:44:13,148 --> 01:44:16,151
使用“感觉”这个词。

990
01:44:19,738 --> 01:44:25,536
但即使我从来不知道
它存在...

991
01:44:26,829 --> 01:44:32,084
我觉得我失去了一个人
这是我生命中的第一次。

992
01:44:37,006 --> 01:44:39,675
但你会继续生活吗？

993
01:44:42,970 --> 01:44:44,179
我要过我的生活。

994
01:44:49,935 --> 01:44:51,520
你将如何过你的生活？

995
01:44:57,067 --> 01:44:58,235
受伤。

996
01:45:00,404 --> 01:45:01,572
忘记。

997
01:45:03,115 --> 01:45:04,450
记住。

998
01:45:07,536 --> 01:45:12,166
有时会哭，
有时会生气...

999
01:45:14,001 --> 01:45:15,878
有时微笑和大笑。

1000
01:45:20,633 --> 01:45:22,217
我想过我的生活感觉的东西。

1001
01:45:43,322 --> 01:45:44,490
我要过我的生活。

1002
01:46:03,467 --> 01:46:06,220
我明天有学校
所以我不能送你走。

1003
01:46:06,762 --> 01:46:07,596
再见。

1004
01:46:09,056 --> 01:46:09,974
谢谢你。

1005
01:46:10,599 --> 01:46:11,558
小心。

1006
01:46:13,227 --> 01:46:14,103
再见。

1007
01:46:16,313 --> 01:46:17,231
晚安。

1008
01:46:52,808 --> 01:46:53,809
若草。

1009
01:46:55,936 --> 01:46:56,895
山田。

1010
01:47:02,192 --> 01:47:04,987
这里。也许你可以把这个随身携带。

1011
01:47:07,156 --> 01:47:08,073
它是什么？

1012
01:47:08,782 --> 01:47:10,909
它有我最喜欢的诗
威廉•吉布森在里面。

1013
01:47:11,785 --> 01:47:13,579
-威廉？
——威廉•吉布森。

1014
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:25,424
谢谢你。

1015
01:47:30,345 --> 01:47:31,513
我们去散散步好吗？

1016
01:47:35,434 --> 01:47:36,268
好的。

1017
01:48:18,852 --> 01:48:19,812
<i>怎么了？</i>

1018
01:48:20,521 --> 01:48:21,355
<i>什么都没有。</i>

1019
01:48:23,732 --> 01:48:25,067
<i>很突然，不是吗？</i>

1020
01:48:28,028 --> 01:48:28,904
<i>嗯……</i>

1021
01:48:29,696 --> 01:48:32,407
<i>这只是一个早春的假期。</i>

1022
01:48:49,591 --> 01:48:52,678
<i>-“这座城市，在瘟疫时期，
-“这座城市，在瘟疫时期，</i>

1023
01:48:53,387 --> 01:48:56,098
<i>-知道我们短暂的永恒。

1024
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,227
<i>-我们短暂的永恒，

1025
01:49:00,686 --> 01:49:01,895
<i>-我们的爱。

1026
01:49:03,063 --> 01:49:04,940
<i>-我们的爱知道...

1027
01:49:05,816 --> 01:49:08,777
<i>-街道上的空白墙壁。

1028

<i>-我们的爱知道沉默的频率。

1029

1030
01:49:17,619 --> 01:49:19,538
<i> - 平坦的领域。

1031
01:49:20,747 --> 01:49:23,208
<i>-我们成为了现场操作员，

1032

<i>-我们试图解码格子。

1036
01:49:38,849 --> 01:49:40,559
<i>-看树叶……

1037
01:49:41,393 --> 01:49:44,313

1038

<i>-我们如何在平地上生存。”
-我们如何在平地上生存。”</i>

1039
01:49:58,660 --> 01:49:59,661
最近...

1040
01:50:01,038 --> 01:50:01,872
是的？

1041
01:50:02,164 --> 01:50:03,749
我看到了田岛的鬼魂。

1042
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,043
什么？

1043
01:50:07,336 --> 01:50:08,962
也许这是我的想象。

1044
01:50:09,922 --> 01:50:11,590
但我想我在学校见过她。

1045
01:50:18,263 --> 01:50:19,181
您认为？

1046
01:50:20,724 --> 01:50:24,645
更准确地说，
我感觉到了，没有看到她。

1047
01:50:26,230 --> 01:50:28,690
就像她就在那里一样，
什么都不做。

1048
01:50:36,782 --> 01:50:38,242
但这并不困扰我。

1049
01:50:42,162 --> 01:50:44,039
我更喜欢她...

1050
01:50:46,166 --> 01:50:48,418
她死的时候比她活着的时候。

1051
01:50:54,633 --> 01:50:57,803
但我希望我更喜欢她
在她还活着的时候。

1052
01:51:10,023 --> 01:51:11,400
你...

1053
01:51:14,945 --> 01:51:17,197
不喜欢人，除非他们死了？

1054
01:51:20,033 --> 01:51:21,326
不是这个。

1055
01:51:21,576 --> 01:51:23,078
我喜欢她。

1056
01:51:26,373 --> 01:51:27,457
那正确吗？

1057
01:51:30,711 --> 01:51:31,670
除了...

1058
01:51:35,048 --> 01:51:37,342
你还活着，我喜欢你。

1059
01:51:49,313 --> 01:51:50,188
我是认真的。

1060
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:57,988
你走后我会想念你的。

1061
01:52:18,675 --> 01:52:19,760
若草。

1062
01:52:22,471 --> 01:52:24,473
让我们再叫一次不明飞行物。

1063
01:52:29,436 --> 01:52:30,645
让我们再试一次。
