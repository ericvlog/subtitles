有时候 事情只是不遂人愿

而好人没赢
and the guys in the white hats don't win.

106
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:28,651
但这并不代表 嗯
But that doesn't make it, uh,

107
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:32,051
并不会从根本上剥夺

I neither took part in nor knew about

140
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,640
任何随后的掩盖证据的活动
any of the subsequent cover-up activities.

141
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:25,071
杰克.托德：一件沮丧的事..
The one frustrating thing about...

142
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:26,471
关于去加拿大
about going to Canada was,

143
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:29,170
就是让我置身于辩论之外
it left me outside the debate here.

144
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,970
直到今天我还感到沮丧
I felt about... frustrated
with that till this day.

145
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,269
当水门丑闻被揭露时 杰克.托德
NARRATOR: As the Watergate
scandal unfolded, Jack Todd,

146
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,570
这个曾擅离美国陆军
who had deserted the United States Army

147
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:39,702
逃亡到加拿大的人
and fled to Canada,

148
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:42,136
他从未感到如此痛苦
had never felt so bitter,

149
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:44,668
如此幻灭 如此疏离
so disenchanted, so out of touch

150
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:47,668
面对变成这副模样的美国
with what the United States
seemed to have become.

151
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:53,501
他问自己“我们怎么让这帮人上台的？”
He asked himself, "How did we
let this gang take charge?"

152
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:59,000
然后他做了一个他会后悔一辈子的决定
Then he made a decision
he would always regret:

153
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:03,199
他放弃了美国公民身份
he renounced his American citizenship.

154
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,266
我认为这是个政治行为
JACK TODD: I thought it
was a political act,

155
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:08,265
放弃我的美国公民身份
renouncing my American citizenship.

156
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:12,865
这是我一生中最蠢的事
And it was the stupidest thing
I have ever done in my life.

157
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:15,298
我是个加拿大公民 我为此自豪
I'm a Canadian citizen and I'm proud of it.

158
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,033
这是个美好的国家 但在这里 我是美国人
It's a wonderful country, but
in here, I'm an American.

159
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,263
约翰.内格罗蓬特：那个协议叫作
JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well,
the agreement was called

160
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:30,330
“在越南结束战争
"The Agreement to End the War

161
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,031
和恢复和平的协议”
and Restore Peace in Vietnam."

162
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,862
当然 这是非常委婉的说法
And, of course, that was a huge euphemism.

163
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:40,162
它既没结束战争 也没恢复和平
It neither ended the war
nor did it restore peace.

164
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:42,695
如果看看它的实质
And if you look at the substance of it,

165
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,129
实际上是个撤军的协议
it really was a withdrawal agreement.

166
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,062
我们用撤离军队
We were withdrawing our forces

167
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:49,062
来换取战俘
in exchange for prisoners of war.

168
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:53,928
这两件事通过和平协议
Those are the two matters that
were definitively settled

169
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,528
得以最后解决
by the peace agreement.

170
00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:00,660
我们让军队撤出 战俘回家
We got our troops out and
we got our prisoners back.

171
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:07,226
其余的部分都是典型的含糊不清
The rest is just all a model
of nebulosity and vagueness

172
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:09,593
没有解决任何事情
and didn't resolve a darn thing.

173
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:13,593
蓝光诗：美国人同意停火后

174
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:21,593
可以让14.5万北越部队留在南方

175
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:29,593
我们怎么能说这是个好的停火协议？

176
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:34,593
如果还有14.5万人留在我们国家？

177
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:39,593
停火后北越立即发起攻击

178
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:43,822
无论北方或南方
NARRATOR: Neither North nor South Vietnam

179
00:11:43,823 --> 00:11:47,187
都没打算遵守
had had any intention of
observing the cease-fire

180
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:49,754
1973年1月27日在巴黎签订的
called for in the peace
treaty signed in Paris

181
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:54,154
呼吁停火的协议
on January 27, 1973.

182
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:56,554
甚至在协议墨迹未干时
Even before the ink was dry,

183
00:11:56,555 --> 00:12:01,021
双方都试图尽可能多的抢占领土
each side had sought to claim
as much territory as it could

184
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:05,352
这被成为“旗帜之战”
in what became known as
"the War of the Flags."

185
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:07,886
停火3周内
Within three weeks of the ceasefire,

186
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:13,318
双方已有3000多起违规行为
there were already some 3,000
violations by both sides.

187
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:16,784
南越总统阮文绍
South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu,

188
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:20,385
现在统帅世界上第5大的军队
who now commanded the
fifth-largest army on Earth,

189
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:25,918
他坚持要南越军占领和坚守每一寸领土
insisted the ARVN take and hold
every inch of South Vietnam,

190
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,984
即便这件事在近60万美军的帮助下
something they had been unable to do

191
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:33,450
他们都未能办到
even with the help of nearly
600,000 American troops.

192
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,282
（爆炸）
(explosion)

193
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:38,483
与此同时 北越军进攻
Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese
had attacked Tay Ninh,

194
00:12:38,484 --> 00:12:40,748
靠近柬埔寨边境的西宁
near the Cambodian border,

195
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:43,681
希望在南方建立
hoping to establish a rival
capital of their own

196
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:45,715
自己的首都
in the South.

197
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:50,314
河内在非军事区下方的溪山附近
Hanoi installed surface-to-air
missiles near Khe Sanh,

198
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:53,548
安装地对空导弹
just below the DMZ.

199
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:57,079
同时 南越军攻击
At the same time, ARVN
troops attacked enclaves

200
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,646
北越夺取的飞地
seized by the North Vietnamese.

201
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:03,880
战斗进行了几个月
The fighting went on for months.

202
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:07,178
河内在南越境内
Hanoi built a new paved highway

203
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:09,613
修建了一条新马路
within South Vietnam itself,

204
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:13,913
200至300台车辆的护卫队
down which convoys of 200 to 300 vehicles

205
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,777
很快开始长驱直入
soon began streaming:

206
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:21,711
卡车、坦克和重型武器在白天移动
trucks, tanks, and heavy guns
moving in broad daylight.

207
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:25,643
他们着手铺设巨大油管
And they began laying
down a giant oil pipeline

208
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:30,111
用以在南方供应车辆燃料
to fuel their vehicles in the South.

209
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:33,543
尼克松私下向阮总统承诺
Nixon had privately
promised President Thieu

210
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:36,709
如果西贡受到严重威胁
that he would retaliate
with American airpower

211
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,043
他会使用美国空中力量报复
if Saigon ever seemed seriously threatened.

212
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:42,674
（槌击声）
(gavel banging)

213
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:45,141
但在华盛顿 一周又一周
But in Washington, week by week,

214
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:48,274
当水门的秘密接连涌现
as the secrets of Watergate
kept tumbling out,

215
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:54,573
尼克松对国会山的影响持续减弱
Nixon's influence on Capitol
Hill steadily weakened.

216
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:59,273
1973年6月 受刺激的国会
In June of 1973, an energized Congress,

217
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:02,540
回应多数美国人的观点
reflecting the views of a
majority of Americans,

218
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,839
投票决定停止在越南
voted to stop all military operations

219
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,738
老挝或柬埔寨的所有军事行动
in or over Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia

220
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:12,571
截止时间为8月15日
by August 15,

221
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:15,006
并坚持没有国会的批准
and insisted that they not be resumed

222
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:17,938
行动不得恢复
without congressional approval.

223
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:20,137
“美国要和平”
"America wants peace,"

224
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:23,737
马萨诸塞州参议员爱德华.肯尼迪宣称
Senator Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts declared.

225
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:29,504
“国会下定决心结束杀戮”
"Congress is strong in its
resolve to end the killing."

226
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,769
列维.索利：我们放弃南越
LEWIS SORLEY: To abandon
the South Vietnamese,

227
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,603
最后只提供资金支持
when all we were providing
them at the end was money,

228
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:38,603
是应该被谴责的行为
was reprehensible,

229
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:42,369
这是不尊重所有军人的牺牲
and disrespected the
sacrifices of all soldiers,

230
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,002
我们的和南越的
ours and the South Vietnamese.

231
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:46,701
我认为道德义务
I think the moral obligation,

232
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:49,868
不是源于阻止共产主义
that doesn't stem from a
philosophical commitment

233
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:51,201
的哲学承诺
to stopping communism.

234
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:54,266
现在是源于履行我们
Now it stems from our keeping our promises

235
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:58,333
对这个不幸的往昔盟友的承诺
to this erstwhile, unfortunate ally.

236
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,200
他们把我们当做盟友
That they had us as the ally

237
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,533
而另外一方有苏联
where the other guys had the Soviet Union

238
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,100
和共产主义中国
and communist China.

239
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:06,866
我想 大多数美国人
Most Americans, I think,

240
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,799
不想听到说共产党人
would not like to hear it
said that the communists

241
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,099
是比美国更忠实的盟友
were more faithful allies
than the United States.

242
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,365
但实际上就是如此
But that is, in fact, what the case was.

243
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:17,864
罗伯特.盖德：虽然有人遗憾 在某些方面
ROBERT GARD: While one regrets
that we pulled the rug out,

244
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:19,731
我们是釜底抽薪
in some respects,

245
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:23,863
我认为最终结果没有区别
I think the ultimate outcome
would've been the same.

246
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:28,629
如果我们继续下去 长期而言
Had we continued, it would have cost

247
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,530
可能会耗费更多人命
probably more lives in the long term

248
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,196
而结果不会改变
with no change in the outcome.

249
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:36,495
签署和平协议后的
NARRATOR: In the 18 bloody months

250
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:38,962
18个血腥的月份里
that followed the signing
of the peace accords,

251
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:44,096
南越的形势变得岌岌可危
South Vietnam's position became
more and more precarious.

252
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:47,528
但到了1974年夏天
But by the summer of 1974,

253
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,395
很少有美国人予以关注
few Americans were paying attention.

254
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:55,060
他们正盯着国内发生的事
They were riveted by what was
happening to their own country.

255
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:57,693
..全面和完整的调查
...to investigate fully and completely

256
00:15:57,694 --> 00:16:00,493
是否有充分理由
whether sufficient grounds exist

257
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,794
让众议院
for the House of Representatives

258
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,992
行使其宪法权力
to exercise its constitutional power

259
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:08,425
弹劾理查德.尼克松
to impeach Richard M. Nixon,

260
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,758
美利坚合众国总统
president of the United States of America.

议长：洛特先生？-不
SPEAKER: Mr. Lott? -No.

266
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:30,056
1974年7月27日
NARRATOR: On July 27, 1974,

267
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,890
众议院司法委员会建议
the House Judiciary Committee recommended

268
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:37,790
以滥用职权弹劾总统
that the president be impeached
for abusing his office.

269
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,554
8月9日 为避免弹劾
On August 9, rather than face impeachment,

270
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:45,488
尼克松成为美国历史上第一位
Richard Nixon became the first
president in American history

271
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:47,421
辞职的总统
to resign.

到了该准备撤离的时候
that the time had come to begin
preparing for an evacuation.

519
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:44,320
西贡还有约5千名美国人
There were still some 5,000

南越人及家属

523
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,452
但格拉汉姆.马丁大使不同意
But Ambassador Graham Martin disagreed.

524
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:59,852
他是个坚定的冷战斗士
He was a resolute Cold Warrior,

525
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:02,151
任命他 意在打消阮文绍

526
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:04,885
对于美国继续支持的疑虑

527
00:32:04,886 --> 00:32:07,584
他儿子在越南的死亡
and his feelings had only been intensified

528
00:32:07,585 --> 00:32:10,384
只能加剧他的这种感觉
by the death of his son in Vietnam.

529
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,650
他曾告诉一位助手
He had not been appointed ambassador,

530
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:14,384
他被任命为大使
he had told an aide,

531
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:18,016
不是要把“越南交给共产党人”

532
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:21,617
他说中情局危言耸听
The C.I.A. was being alarmist, he said.

533
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:23,883
西贡不会受到任何攻击
There would be no attack on Saigon,

534
00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:27,215
所以不必撤离
and, therefore, no evacuation.

535
00:32:27,216 --> 00:32:32,449
阮文绍总统也坚持还有希望

541
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:52,979
这是通往西贡的最后障碍

542
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,780
尽管北越兵力和武器占优

00:32:55,781 --> 00:33:00,013
南越指挥官坚守不退

refused to retreat.

00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:04,779
他决心把敌人拒于首都之外

我向你保证

如果他们拒绝 而西贡陷落

559
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:45,739
应由国会而非白宫承受责难

to behave like that.

573
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,868

美国人所痛恨的战争

659
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:16,637
你只能这样失去国家和梦想

660
00:39:16,638 --> 00:39:20,138
感受..那种耻辱

665
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:53,138
我不想结婚

666
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:56,138
我的领导劝我

667
00:39:56,138 --> 00:40:00,138
“如果你只关注打仗而没有后代

668
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:04,138
那将来我们的战士从哪儿来？”

669
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:07,138
幸运的是 我还是结婚了

670
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:10,138
有了两个儿子

671
00:40:10,138 --> 00:40:14,138
他们长大后也参了军

672
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:21,138
然后在1975年

673
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:27,138
在我们接近胜利时

674

have always sent a wreath

676
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:47,993
他的墓送花圈
to his grave at Arlington.

677
00:40:47,994 --> 00:40:51,060
当然部分是怀念他
Partly in remembrance, of course, of him,

678
00:40:51,061 --> 00:40:55,059
但想到如果其他伤心人也在那里
but also thinking, if other
grieving people are there,

679
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,226
或只是前去瞻仰的游客
or just people that are
visiting to pay their respects,

680
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:03,558
那会让他们了解到
that it's good for them
to know that people are,

681
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,858
这些军人仍被人怀念
that the soldiers are remembered.

682
00:41:20,256 --> 00:41:22,755
福特：今天..
FORD: Today...

683

美国可以重拾
America can regain the sense of pride

684
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:29,687

00:48:10,877 --> 00:48:13,309
建筑物燃烧的烟雾
from exploding artillery shells.

819
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,209
我永远不会忘记飞越海岸线的情景
And I'll never forget going
over that coastline,

820
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:20,241
看到整支第七舰队..许多的船..
seeing the entire 7th
Fleet... dozens and dozens...

821
00:48:20,242 --> 00:48:23,342
那支巨大的舰队出现在那里
and this enormous fleet
out there like that.

822
00:48:23,343 --> 00:48:28,307
我完全记得那种难以置信的感觉
And I just remember this sense
of, of disbelief, completely.

823
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:31,375
难以置信 同时又深感安慰
Disbelief and relief at the same time.

824
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:36,740
瓦尔迪兹：有1到1.2万人
VALDEZ: There were anywhere
from 10,000 to 12,000 people

825
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:39,074
来自四面八方围住使馆
surrounding the embassy.

826
00:48:39,075 --> 00:48:42,474
我们想让美国人离开那里
We're supposed to get
Americans out of there.

827
00:48:42,475 --> 00:48:44,806
我们还想让为我们工作的
And we were supposed to
get South Vietnamese

828
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:47,673
南越人进入使馆
that worked for us in the embassy.

829
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,006
中情局在我们身后
The C.I.A. was behind us,

830
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,305
他们指认
and they were pointing at the people

831
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:53,238
应该出来的人
who were supposed to get out.

832
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:56,037
但每次你伸手去抓指定的那个
But every time you reached out
to grab a specific individual,

833
00:48:56,038 --> 00:48:57,905
其他人会抓住你的手
other people were grabbing your hands

834
00:48:57,906 --> 00:48:59,972
试图把你拉下来
and trying to pull you
down with them, you know,

835
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:01,472
这样的话你可能会帮他们出来
so that you could help them out.

836
00:49:01,473 --> 00:49:05,136
斯奈普：一些美国人走得如此仓促
SNEPP: Some Americans had left so rapidly,

837
00:49:05,137 --> 00:49:07,803
他们把电台丢下来
they'd left the radios behind.

838
00:49:07,804 --> 00:49:11,937
于是他们的越南朋友
So their Vietnamese friends
were on the radios

839
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:13,802
就在电台上呼救
begging to be rescued.

840
00:49:13,803 --> 00:49:16,170
“我是韩 你的司机”
"I'm Han, the driver."

841
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:19,403
“我是玉先生 你的翻译”
"I'm Mr. Ngoc, your translator."

842
00:49:19,404 --> 00:49:24,234
我意识到美国人在越南的惯常行为
I realized what the Americans
had often done in Vietnam.

843
00:49:24,235 --> 00:49:29,170
他们忘了这些也是人类
They had forgotten that
these were human beings.

844
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,700
我在越南的经历
My experience in Vietnam

845
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:39,933
犹如开着一架B-52在高处投弹
had often been like a
B-52 strike from on high.

846
00:49:39,934 --> 00:49:43,866
我不必面对这些行动的后果
I never had to confront the
consequences of my action.

847
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:47,099
我可以就那么让炸弹舱门开着
I could just let the bomb doors open

848
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,432
仍旧保持超然
and still remain detached.

849
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:53,765
使馆里别的地方
NARRATOR: Elsewhere in the embassy,

850
00:49:53,766 --> 00:49:57,931
陆战队员疯狂的销毁机密文件
Marines frantically destroyed
classified documents.

851
00:49:57,932 --> 00:50:01,030
瓦尔迪兹：屋顶有2个大焚烧炉
VALDEZ: The top of the roof
had two big incinerators

852
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,565
就在直升机停机坪下方
right underneath the helicopter pad.

853
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:06,130
陆战队焚烧机密文件
And the Marines burned classified material

854
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,196
争分夺秒
around the clock.

855
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:10,363
但据我了解 即使到我们离开时
But to my understanding, even when we left,

856
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:14,096
仍有机密资料留下
there was still classified
material left behind.

857
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:17,762
斯奈普：直升机最后到来时
SNEPP: Well, when the choppers
finally began coming in,

858
00:50:17,763 --> 00:50:20,595
向下的气流撕开那些袋子
the downdraft ripped open those bags

859
00:50:20,596 --> 00:50:22,996
机密资料在停车场上
and there was classified material

860
00:50:22,997 --> 00:50:26,361
散落了一地
all over the parking lot.

861
00:50:26,362 --> 00:50:28,294
北越人抵达时
When the North Vietnamese arrived,

862
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:34,093
显然他们只需用胶带把资料粘合
they apparently Scotch-taped
that material back together

863
00:50:34,094 --> 00:50:36,360
就会成为一份杀戮名单
and it became a blood
list that they could use

864
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:39,693
用来追捕为我们工作的越南人
to track down people, Vietnamese,
who'd worked for us.

865
00:50:39,694 --> 00:50:43,560
使馆官员把成袋的钞票
NARRATOR: Embassy officials
dumped bags of currency

866
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:45,025
倾进油桶
into an oil drum

867
00:50:45,026 --> 00:50:46,792
并点着火
and set it afire.

868
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,560
几百万应急资金
Millions of dollars in contingency funds

869
00:50:49,561 --> 00:50:51,758
化作烟尘
went up in smoke.

870
00:50:51,759 --> 00:50:55,492
“这是西贡站最后的讯息”
"This will be the final
message from Saigon station,"

871
00:50:55,493 --> 00:50:59,659
中情局站长波尔加给华盛顿发电报
the C.I.A. chief Thomas
Polgar wired to Washington.

872
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:04,590
“这是场漫长的战斗 而我们输了
"It has been a long fight and we have lost.

873
00:51:04,591 --> 00:51:07,523
“那些未从历史中汲取教训的人
"Those who fail to learn from history

874
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:09,589
“被迫重复失败
"are forced to repeat it.

875
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,923
“我们希望不再有另一个越南的经历
"Let us hope that we will not
have another Vietnam experience

876
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:16,689
“我们已吸取教训
"and that we have learned our lesson.

877
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:20,022
西贡汇报完毕”
Saigon signing off."

878
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:26,389
50多架美国直升机
More than 50 U.S. helicopters

879
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,555
现在在西贡上空穿梭
now crisscrossed the sky over Saigon,

880
00:51:29,556 --> 00:51:33,087
从指定的屋顶还有大使馆
picking up evacuees from
designated rooftops,

881
00:51:33,088 --> 00:51:35,420
搭载撤离人员
as well as the embassy,

882
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:38,753
把他们运到远海的舰队上
ferrying them to the fleet far out at sea,

883
00:51:38,754 --> 00:51:40,555
然后返回接更多人
then returning for more.

884
00:51:42,287 --> 00:51:45,118
某些不顾一切的南越军官
Some desperate South Vietnamese officers

885
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,053
也为自己和家人
also commandeered helicopters

886
00:51:47,054 --> 00:51:49,419
强行征用直升机
for themselves and their families,

887
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,453
铤而走险挤上
dangerously crowding the decks

888
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:54,052
美军航空母舰的甲板
of the American aircraft carriers.

889
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:56,985
并没有空间留给他们
There was no room for them.

890
00:51:56,986 --> 00:51:59,684
威尔班克：我脑海里一直
WILLBANKS: The image
that remains in my mind

891
00:51:59,685 --> 00:52:01,717
留存着直升飞机的画面
is the picture of the helicopter

892
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,551
从航母的一侧被推入大海
being pushed over the side of the carrier.

893
00:52:04,552 --> 00:52:07,783
在越南直升机就是一切
The helicopter was everything in Vietnam.

894
00:52:07,784 --> 00:52:10,683
我是说 它时刻待命 它补充给养
I mean, it was dust-off, it was resupply,

895
00:52:10,684 --> 00:52:13,115
它是火力支援 它就是一切
it was fire support, it was everything.

896
00:52:13,116 --> 00:52:18,249
我满脑子想的是 太浪费了
All I could think of was:
what a waste, what a waste.

897
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,781
当我目睹眼前的一切
As I watched that all unfold,

898
00:52:20,782 --> 00:52:24,882
我深感自责
I, I felt responsible.

899
00:52:24,883 --> 00:52:26,114
我很惭愧
I was ashamed.

900
00:52:26,115 --> 00:52:28,181
我们告诉过这些人
We had told these people

901
00:52:28,182 --> 00:52:30,448
我们会在那里支持他们
that we would be there to support them

902
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:31,949
而我们没有
and we were not.

903
00:52:37,049 --> 00:52:40,913
斯奈普：最后一个晚上9点15分左右
SNEPP: About 9:15 on the last night,

904
00:52:40,914 --> 00:52:44,147
波尔加过来说“我们都要离开了
Polgar came and he said,
"We've got to all leave.

905
00:52:44,148 --> 00:52:45,779
“总部命令离开
"We've been ordered by
headquarters to leave.

906
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,479
我们走吧”
Let's go."

907
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,678
马丁大使想成为最后一个离开的人
NARRATOR: Ambassador Martin had
wanted to be the last man to leave.

908
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:55,479
但4月30日大约凌晨4点
But at about 4:00 in the
morning of April 30,

909
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,844
一架CH-46在使馆屋顶着陆
a CH-46 touched down on the embassy roof.

910
00:52:59,845 --> 00:53:03,878
飞行员带着总统手令
Its pilot carried orders
from the president himself.

911
00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:07,776
马丁现在就要离开
Martin was to leave, now.

912
00:53:07,777 --> 00:53:10,276
“我想就是这样了”他说
"I guess this is it," he said.

913
00:53:10,277 --> 00:53:12,444
当马丁被搀上飞机
As Martin was helped aboard,

914
00:53:12,445 --> 00:53:15,108
他接过卷起的美国国旗
he was handed the furled American flag

915
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:19,376
这面旗帜前一天还在使馆旗杆上飘扬
that had flown from the
flagstaff the previous day.

916
00:53:19,377 --> 00:53:25,375
他于凌晨4点59分起飞 直奔海上
He lifted off at 4:58 a.m.
and headed out to sea.

917
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:29,442
福特总统也下令从那时起
President Ford had also
ordered that from then on,

918
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:33,840
只撤离美国人
only Americans would be evacuated.

919
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:37,740
数以万计的南越人
Tens of thousands of South Vietnamese

920
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:39,706
会被遗弃
would be left behind,

921
00:53:39,707 --> 00:53:42,440
400多人还在
and more than 400 were still waiting

922
00:53:42,441 --> 00:53:44,140
使馆院内等待着
in the embassy courtyard.

923
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:46,873
他们一再被保证
Time and again, they had been assured

924
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:50,838
直升机正在接他们的路上
helicopters were on the
way to pick them up.

925
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:53,504
赫林顿：我被指示
HERRINGTON: I was directed

926
00:53:53,505 --> 00:53:56,805
和越南人待在一起 让他们保暖
to stay with the Vietnamese
and keep them warm,

927
00:53:56,806 --> 00:53:59,503
意思是“不要有任何暗示
meaning, "Don't give any hint

928
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:05,170
我们作出的所有承诺都是泡影”
that all these promises we
made to them are for naught."

929
00:54:05,171 --> 00:54:07,370
我心里很难受 度过了一段艰难时刻
I felt sick at heart, I had a hard time.

930
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:09,336
天色很黑 所以我不必担心
It was dark out, so I didn't have to worry

931
00:54:09,337 --> 00:54:12,470
直视这些人的眼睛
about looking these folks in the eye.

932
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:15,602
但我找了个借口（说越南语）..
But I made my excuse and,
um, (speaks Vietnamese)...

933
00:54:15,603 --> 00:54:17,568
“我要去洗手间”
"I have to go to the bathroom."

934
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:20,936
离开后走进园林
And left into the landscaping,

935
00:54:20,937 --> 00:54:23,835
迂回到大使馆后门
circuitous route to the
back door of the embassy,

936
00:54:23,836 --> 00:54:25,567
到了使馆办公楼
to the chancery building,

937
00:54:25,568 --> 00:54:27,968
径直上了屋顶
and made my way to the roof.

938
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:32,834
约有129名陆战队员还留在院子里
NARRATOR: Some 129 Marines
remained in the compound.

939
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:34,134
他们奋力
They did their best

940
00:54:34,135 --> 00:54:37,566
撤进使馆 登上屋顶
to pull back into the embassy
and up onto the roof

941
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,134
没有惊动越南人
without alerting the Vietnamese

942
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:42,300
他们即将被遗弃
that they were about to be left behind.

943
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:45,433
瓦尔迪兹：我们把自己锁进大使馆
VALDEZ: We locked ourselves
inside the embassy

944
00:54:45,434 --> 00:54:48,832
然后来到屋顶上
and found ourselves up on the roof.

945
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:51,299
其实上了屋顶以后
It was actually after we
got up on top of the roof

946
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,264
我们才看见庞大的人群
that we started seeing all
these masses of people.

947
00:54:53,265 --> 00:54:55,731
有的已经进到使馆院内
Some of them had already come
on the embassy compound.

948
00:54:55,732 --> 00:54:57,331
他们破坏了院门
And they broke those doors.

949
00:54:57,332 --> 00:55:00,231
这样那些南越人

had somehow been left
behind on the embassy roof.

974

已经派出直升机去接他们

978
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:30,354
再也没有直升机的动静

979
00:56:30,355 --> 00:56:32,921
他们的电台坏了

陆战队没有办法联系舰队

我们滞留在那里
We're being left behind.

984
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:46,052
大家坐在那里胡思乱想
People are sitting around in
their own little thoughts,

985
00:56:46,053 --> 00:56:48,852
都沉默不语
uh, not doing too much talking.

986
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:51,952
我们几乎决定要杀出去
We pretty much decided that we
were going to fight it out,

987
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:53,385

1002

南越政府

杨文明总统上午在总统府发表讲话

保宁：如果杨文明没有下令投降

1010
00:58:06,244 --> 00:58:09,244
那就会很可怕

1011
00:58:09,244 --> 00:58:13,244
我们都得死

1012
00:58:13,244 --> 00:58:17,244
我有朋友在南越部队

1013
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:21,244
咒骂杨总统

1014

恨他是因为他下令投降

1015
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:27,244
让越共赢得胜利

1016
00:58:27,244 --> 00:58:32,244
我在美国的朋友仍咒骂杨文明

1017
00:58:32,244 --> 00:58:34,244
但他们忘记了

1018
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:37,244
如果他不下令

1019
00:58:37,244 --> 00:58:40,244
他们不会幸存下来去美国

1020
00:58:40,244 --> 00:58:44,244
并成为美国公民

1021

00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:04,244
最终我决定不逃

1026
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:09,244
我不得不接受现实

1027
00:59:09,244 --> 00:59:13,244
每个人都在谈论一场血洗

1028
00:59:13,244 --> 00:59:18,244
作为一名天主教徒我不能自杀

1029
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:21,244
象很多人选择的那样

1030
00:59:21,244 --> 00:59:25,244

我尝试步行回西贡的家

1056
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,760
我想死

1057

1073
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:03,084
我不在乎哪边赢

01:02:54,012 --> 01:02:57,012
我活了下来

1090
01:02:57,012 --> 01:03:02,012
但我为失去他们而哭泣

1091
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:07,012
无论何时我听到那首歌

1092
01:03:07,012 --> 01:03:13,012
“你走了 三次远走 再不归来”

1093
01:03:13,012 --> 01:03:17,012
我无法忍住自己的眼泪

1094
01:03:17,012 --> 01:03:21,012
因为我深爱死去的弟兄们

1095
01:03:21,641 --> 01:03:25,241
在越南 我们终于到达隧道尽头
In Vietnam, we finally have
reached the end of the tunnel,

1096
01:03:25,242 --> 01:03:27,575
而那里没有亮光
and there is no light there.

1097
01:03:27,576 --> 01:03:31,173
那里有的 也许正如福特总统所说
What is there, perhaps, was
best said by President Ford,

1098
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,606
“一场已经结束的战争”
"a war that is finished."

1099
01:03:33,607 --> 01:03:37,240
列维.索利：我碰巧在
LEWIS SORLEY: I happened
to be at a conference

1100
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:38,705
塔夫茨大学开会
at Tufts University,

1101
01:03:38,706 --> 01:03:41,406
那里的院长是前任大使
and the dean there was a former ambassador

1102
01:03:41,407 --> 01:03:43,373
当天晚上他给我们讲话
who spoke to us late on that day,

1103
01:03:43,374 --> 01:03:45,772
结果 那是命里注定的一天
as it turned out, the fateful day.

1104
01:03:45,773 --> 01:03:49,104
他说他刚从华盛顿回来
And he said he had just
come back from Washington,

1105
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:52,838
那里春和景明
where the spring weather was beautiful

1106
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:55,536
水仙花盛开
and the daffodils were in bloom,

1107
01:03:55,537 --> 01:04:01,838
到了波士顿就天色晦暗 如同他的内心
to Boston, where it was gloomy
and gray as it was in his heart.

1108
01:04:03,738 --> 01:04:06,970
人们就嘘他和起哄
And people hissed him and booed him.

1109
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:10,370
我穿着制服
I was there in uniform.

1110
01:04:10,371 --> 01:04:12,736
我最大的遗憾就是没起身
One of my great regrets
was that I did not get up

1111
01:04:12,737 --> 01:04:14,768
去痛斥那些人
and start laying waste to those people

1112
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:16,168
他们不尊重大使
who disrespected the ambassador

1113
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:19,235
和他对南越陷落的痛心
and his sorrow at the
fall of South Vietnam.

1114
01:04:19,236 --> 01:04:21,735
马斯格雷夫：我接到一个
“越战老兵反战”全国办公室的电话
I got a call from the V.V.A.W.
national office

1115
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:24,401
是些过去的老朋友
from some friends of
mine from the old days.

1116
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,500
他们有个盛大的庆祝活动
They were having a big celebration,

1117
01:04:26,501 --> 01:04:29,633
开怀畅饮 说“这是个好日子 不是吗？”
drinking booze and, "Ah, well,
it's a great day, isn't it?"

1118
01:04:29,634 --> 01:04:32,666
我说“你有病吧？”
And I said, "Are you nuts?"

1119
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:35,666
我说“这不是个好日子”
I said, "No, it's not a great day."

1120
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:38,666
看到美国人象那样离开
To see America leaving like that,

1121
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:43,431
历经近6万美国儿女捐躯之后
after we'd given almost 60,000
of our sons and daughters,

1122
01:04:43,432 --> 01:04:47,031
这不是什么值得庆祝的事情
that wasn't something to celebrate.

1123
01:04:47,032 --> 01:04:48,998
我知道我们正在抛弃
I knew we were abandoning

1124
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:52,565
数百万信任我们
millions of South Vietnamese
that had trusted us,

1125
01:04:52,566 --> 01:04:55,465
和我们休戚与共的越南人
thrown in their lot with us.

1126
01:04:55,466 --> 01:04:58,696
这根本不值得庆祝
That wasn't anything to celebrate.

1127
01:04:58,697 --> 01:05:01,163
我想这是我在美国历史上
I thought it was just one
of the saddest moments

1128
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:04,897
看到过的最悲哀的时刻
I'd ever seen in American history.

1129
01:05:04,898 --> 01:05:07,028
所以当未来某些政客 由于某种原因
So when some future
politician, for some reason,

1130
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:11,128
觉得需要把国家拖入战争
feels the need to drag
this country into a war,

1131
01:05:11,129 --> 01:05:13,028
他可以来阿灵顿国家公墓
he might come out here to Arlington,

1132
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:15,229
可以站在这里某个地方
and stand maybe right over there somewhere,

1133
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:19,095
宣布他的决定 并说出他的想法
to make his announcement and
to tell what he has in mind.

1134
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:27,095
越南战争持续了30年

1135
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:30,095
从1945到1975年

1136
01:05:30,095 --> 01:05:33,095
我属于少数几个

1137
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,095
能活着回家的人

1138
01:05:36,095 --> 01:05:42,095
打了6年仗后我走进家门

1139
01:05:42,095 --> 01:05:45,095
6年里没写过一封信

1140
01:05:45,095 --> 01:05:50,095
6年来我妈妈不知道我是死是活

1141
01:05:50,095 --> 01:05:54,095
你能想象出一个母亲该有多高兴？

1142
01:05:54,095 --> 01:05:58,095
战争让女性最悲惨

1143
01:05:58,095 --> 01:06:04,095
接着就是最高兴

1144
01:06:04,095 --> 01:06:10,095
我妈妈哭了 但我们没有抱头痛哭

1145
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:14,095
越南人就这样

1146
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:17,095
我妈妈马上想到我们的邻居

1147
01:06:17,095 --> 01:06:20,095
他家刚收到一封阵亡通知书

1148
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:23,095
在我们这个楼里

1149
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:26,095
有6个人应征

1150
01:06:26,095 --> 01:06:29,095
只有我回来了

1151
01:06:29,095 --> 01:06:35,095
但我们不敢庆祝

1152
01:06:37,095 --> 01:06:42,095
因为邻居家都失去了孩子

1153
01:06:48,818 --> 01:06:58,818
（掌声）
(cheering)

1154
01:06:51,618 --> 01:06:55,084
汤姆.瓦列雷：在越南 共产党欢庆胜利
TOM VALLELY: In Vietnam, the
Communist Party is triumphant.

1155
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:57,851
但他们也有例外主义
And they have exceptionalism, too.

1156
01:06:57,852 --> 01:07:01,717
他们的例外主义是他们的阻碍
And their exceptionalism gets in their way

1157
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:05,482
就像我们的例外主义是我们的阻碍
just like our exceptionalism
got in our way.

1158
01:07:05,483 --> 01:07:09,382
因此他们在军事意义上统一了国家
So they unify the country
in a military sense,

1159
01:07:09,383 --> 01:07:13,849
然而胜利后他们并没有真正统一
and then they, they don't really
unify the country after that.

1160
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:18,448
他们尝试过 但他们失败了
They, they try, but they fail.

1161
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:21,313
最后并没有出现
NARRATOR: In the end,
there was no bloodbath

1162
01:07:21,314 --> 01:07:24,380
很多人担心的大规模屠杀
on the scale many had feared,

1163
01:07:24,381 --> 01:07:28,947
但在农村 有数百乃至数千人

of people in the countryside

1164
01:07:28,948 --> 01:07:30,647
据称死于

1165
01:07:30,648 --> 01:07:35,979
个别复仇行为或政治报复

or political retaliation.

1166
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:39,146
那些服务于阮文绍政权的人
Those who had served the Thieu regime,

1167
01:07:39,147 --> 01:07:41,811
从将军到普通文员
from generals to ordinary clerks,

1168
01:07:41,812 --> 01:07:45,546
被要求接受再教育
were required to undergo re-education.

1169
01:07:45,547 --> 01:07:47,477
当兵的人获悉
Enlisted men were assured

1170
01:07:47,478 --> 01:07:51,145
他们只需接受为期3天的“学习”

to three days of "study."

1171
01:07:51,146 --> 01:07:55,678

Officers needn't attend
for more than a month.

1172
01:07:55,678 --> 01:08:01,678
范唯必：有人以为去的时间不会长

1173
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:04,678
但我不这么认为

1174
01:08:04,678 --> 01:08:10,678
我在再教育营

1175
01:08:10,678 --> 01:08:13,678
待了7年半

1176
01:08:13,678 --> 01:08:18,678
我属于最后被释放的100人之列

1177
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:23,678
韦德：提到去教育营 媒体说“去学习”

1178
01:08:23,678 --> 01:08:26,678
没人说过“去监狱”

1179
01:08:27,607 --> 01:08:29,841
据信有150万人
NARRATOR: A million and a half people

1180
01:08:29,842 --> 01:08:34,640
经历了不同形式的思想教化

some form of indoctrination.

1181
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:39,206
南越军人公墓被推平或上锁
ARVN cemeteries were
bulldozed or padlocked,

1182
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:42,205
仿佛一个独立南越的记忆
as if the memory of an
independent South Vietnam,

1183
01:08:42,206 --> 01:08:45,104
以及那些为这个事业而死的人
and those who had died for that cause,

1184
01:08:45,105 --> 01:08:48,339
可以被一同抹去
could both be obliterated.

1185
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,937
杨文梅：共产党人
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: The communists,

1186
01:08:49,938 --> 01:08:53,370
努力消除前政权

残留的痕迹

不允许战争中

哀悼 建坟和纪念他们

and to honor their memory.

1191
01:09:08,236 --> 01:09:11,901
造成的分裂延续至今
It caused a division
that lasts to this day,

1192
01:09:11,902 --> 01:09:16,900
胜利者容不下失败者
that the winners would not
accommodate the losers

1193
01:09:16,901 --> 01:09:18,836
某种程度上是这样
in some way.

1194
01:09:18,836 --> 01:09:24,836
阮玉：我们成了一个国家

1195
01:09:24,836 --> 01:09:27,836
但我要说的是

1196
01:09:27,836 --> 01:09:31,836
越南人民从未象今天这样分裂过

降到了最低点

1227
01:11:20,289 --> 01:11:22,289
那是绝对的可怕

1228
01:11:22,289 --> 01:11:25,289
战争期间 人们能接受艰难困苦

1229
01:11:25,289 --> 01:11:29,289
但战后

1230
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:32,289
这是个巨大错误

1231
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:35,289
斯大林主义经济政策的恶果

1232
01:11:35,289 --> 01:11:38,289
这是共产主义的经济问题

1233
01:11:38,286 --> 01:11:41,252
使这些问题更加严重的是
NARRATOR: To compound its problems,

1234
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:44,918
越南发现自己再次因
Vietnam found itself, once again, at war,

1235
01:11:44,919 --> 01:11:48,551
两个共产强权之间的利益招致战争
caught between the interests
of the two communist powers

1236
01:11:48,552 --> 01:11:51,551
他们曾是其最坚定的盟友
that had once been its staunchest allies,

1237
01:11:51,552 --> 01:11:54,184
中国和苏联

（枪声 叫喊）

1239
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:58,683
当粗暴的柬埔寨毛派政权
After the brutal Maoist regime in Cambodia

1240
01:11:58,684 --> 01:12:00,282
袭击边境地区之后
raided border areas,

1241
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:04,449
越南军队在苏联人的武装和打气之下
Vietnamese troops, with Soviet

01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:09,148
于1978年越过边界推翻了它
crossed the frontier in
1978 and overthrew it.

1243
01:12:09,149 --> 01:12:11,381
一场令人沮丧的
A frustrating ten-year

为期十年的镇压运动接踵而至

1245
01:12:13,983 --> 01:12:18,714
有人称之为“越南人的越南”
that some called "Vietnam's Vietnam."

1246
01:12:18,715 --> 01:12:20,647
运动结束时
Before it was over,

1247
01:12:20,648 --> 01:12:24,547
约有5万越南人死于非命
the Vietnamese would lose
some 50,000 more men,

1248
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:29,713
几乎和死在越战的美国人一样多
almost as many as the Americans
had lost in their war.

1249
01:12:29,714 --> 01:12:31,114
（爆炸 炮声）
(explosions and gunfire)

1250
01:12:31,115 --> 01:12:33,078
与此同时 共产中国
Meanwhile, communist China,

1251
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:37,046
决心惩罚越南入侵柬埔寨
determined to punish Vietnam
for invading Cambodia,

1252
01:12:37,047 --> 01:12:39,746
并向莫斯科展示它不能
and to show Moscow it would
not have a free hand

1253
01:12:39,747 --> 01:12:41,546
在东南亚不受约束
in Southeast Asia,

1254
01:12:41,547 --> 01:12:46,144
派出了8.5万人的部队闯入越南北部
sent 85,000 troops storming
into northern Vietnam.

1255
01:12:46,145 --> 01:12:49,512
在越南人把他们打回去之前
They devastated areas along the border

1256
01:12:49,513 --> 01:12:53,312
他们破坏了边境沿线

They come ashore at the
rate of 10,000 a month,

1259
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:05,275
比美国和其他国家愿意接收的
much faster than the United
States or any other nation

1260
01:13:05,276 --> 01:13:07,176
速度要快得多
is willing to accept them.

1261
01:13:07,177 --> 01:13:11,274
他们来追逐一个飘忽的记忆：
They come chasing an elusive memory:

1262
01:13:11,275 --> 01:13:13,475
美国的承诺
the promise of America.

1263
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:18,873
最终150万人逃离越南
NARRATOR: A million and a half people
would eventually flee Vietnam:

1264
01:13:18,874 --> 01:13:21,974
旧日西贡政权的支持者们
supporters of the old Saigon regime,

1265
01:13:21,975 --> 01:13:24,008
来自柬埔寨边境
refugees from the renewed fighting

1266
01:13:24,009 --> 01:13:26,073
重新开战地区的难民

1267
01:13:26,074 --> 01:13:28,939
遭受新政府严苛对待的

1268
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:33,439
越南华裔居民
whom the new government had
treated especially harshly.

1269
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,705
成千上万的船民死亡

1270
01:13:37,706 --> 01:13:40,039
其他人在遍布东南亚的
Others suffered in refugee camps

1271
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,339
难民营受苦

1272
01:13:46,606 --> 01:13:51,738
约有40万人最终到达美国
Some 400,000 eventually made it to America,

1273
01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:54,569
在那里他们被安置到几乎每个州
where they settled in nearly every state,

1274
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:57,470
勤勤恳恳 艰苦创业
industrious, entrepreneurial,

1275
01:13:57,471 --> 01:14:01,304
比亚洲其他移民群体
more eager to take part in
American political life

1276
01:14:01,305 --> 01:14:04,902
更加渴望参与美国政治生活
and more likely to become American citizens

1277
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:08,402
更愿意成为美国公民
than other immigrant groups from Asia.

1278
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:12,468
但对于第一代越南裔美国人
But for that first generation
of Vietnamese Americans,

1279
01:14:12,469 --> 01:14:17,503
家园的记忆永远不会被抹去
memories of their homeland
could never be erased.

1280
01:14:17,503 --> 01:14:23,503
陈玉全：差不多30年过去了 我很幸福

1281
01:14:23,503 --> 01:14:28,503
我为自己和家庭作出了正确选择

1282
01:14:28,503 --> 01:14:35,503
尽管我希望能够回越南 死在那里

1283
01:14:35,503 --> 01:14:39,503
我想对我的孩子们说

1284
01:14:39,503 --> 01:14:43,503
“我想回越南了却余生”

1285
01:14:43,503 --> 01:14:46,503
但我没有这样的勇气

1286
01:14:46,503 --> 01:14:49,503
因为那样会伤害他们的感情

1287
01:14:49,503 --> 01:14:54,503
我不想让他们误解我

1288
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:06,462
卡尔.马兰奇：我记得
KARL MARLANTES: I remember I was

1289
01:15:06,463 --> 01:15:08,596
我和一个女儿在一起..（笑）
with one of my daughters, uh... (chuckles)

1290
01:15:08,597 --> 01:15:10,928
在十字路口某人在我后面
at an intersection and
some guy came up behind me

1291
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:14,060
按喇叭
and blasted the horn.

1292
01:15:14,061 --> 01:15:16,260
当我清醒过来时
When I came to my senses,

1293
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:18,295
我站在他汽车的引擎盖上
I was on the hood of his car,

1294
01:15:18,296 --> 01:15:21,360
准备要踢他的挡风玻璃
about to, trying to kick his windshield in.

1295
01:15:21,361 --> 01:15:23,626
周围的人都在看着我
And I went... and there's
people all over looking at me.

1296
01:15:23,627 --> 01:15:25,393
我是说 真是疯了 真是疯了
I mean, this is crazy. This is crazy.

1297
01:15:25,394 --> 01:15:27,259
接着我开始觉得“这真是不可思议”
And then I started going,
"Well, this is weird."

1298
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,660
我躲回自己车里
I sort of slinked back
to my car and, you know,

1299
01:15:29,661 --> 01:15:31,358
我的女儿 大概4岁 看着我
my daughter, she's about
four, looking at me,

1300
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:32,493
“哇 这是怎么回事？”
"Wow, what's that all about?"

1301
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:33,925
我也在想“这是怎么回事？”
And I go, "What is that all about?"

1302
01:15:33,926 --> 01:15:35,159
我不知道
I had no idea.

1303
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,527
我不知道它是否与战争有关
I had no idea that it was
even related to the war.

1304
01:15:39,626 --> 01:15:43,525
它和战争本身一样古老
NARRATOR: It is as old as war itself.

1305
01:15:43,526 --> 01:15:46,493
古希腊人称之为“神圣的疯狂”
The ancient Greeks called
it "divine madness."

1306
01:15:49,292 --> 01:15:54,457
在南北战争中叫“士兵之心”
It was "soldier's heart" in the Civil War,

1307
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:59,156
一次大战期间叫“炮弹休克症”
"shell shock" during the First World War

1308
01:15:59,157 --> 01:16:01,491
二战中叫“战斗疲劳症”
and "combat fatigue" in the Second.

1309
01:16:05,457 --> 01:16:08,621
之后的越南 它被赋予一个新的名字
Following Vietnam, it was given a new name,

1310
01:16:08,622 --> 01:16:12,054
创伤后应激障碍
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder...

1311
01:16:12,055 --> 01:16:14,789
PTSD.

1312
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:19,521
马兰奇：你懂得PTSD无法痊愈
MARLANTES: And what you learn
is that PTSD doesn't go away.

1313
01:16:19,522 --> 01:16:22,887
但现在如果有人按喇叭
But now if someone honks the horn,

1314
01:16:22,888 --> 01:16:24,387
还会吓我一跳
and it startles me, I'm still...

1315
01:16:24,388 --> 01:16:26,087
我的心率还会上升
My heart rate's still going to go up,

1316
01:16:26,088 --> 01:16:28,119
会持续5分钟 就是这样
and it'll be there for five
minutes and I'm like this.

1317
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,852
但是“10 9 ..那只是某个混蛋
But, "Ten, nine, it's just some asshole,

1318
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:33,052
“他今天工作不顺心..8 7 6
"he's had a bad day at
work, eight, seven, six,

1319
01:16:33,053 --> 01:16:34,918
“没人朝你开枪 你很安全
"it's not... no one's
shooting at you, you're safe,

1320
01:16:34,919 --> 01:16:36,551
7 6 5 4 3 2 1”
it's seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one."

1321
01:16:36,552 --> 01:16:38,185
于是我能控制自己了
And I can control it,

1322
01:16:38,186 --> 01:16:39,551
然而以前我做不到
whereas I couldn't do it before

1323
01:16:39,552 --> 01:16:41,619
因为我不明白是怎么回事
because I didn't understand
what was going on.

1324
01:16:43,219 --> 01:16:45,750
让很多老兵痛苦加深的
NARRATOR: Adding to the
pain many veterans felt

1325
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:50,018
是他们的国家急于忘掉这场战争
was their country's eagerness
to forget the war.

1326
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:52,550
几乎没有列队欢迎
There were few parades.

1327
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:59,651
每个人从越南各走各路 独自回家
In many ways, everyone came
home from Vietnam alone.

1328
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,149
我回到家时
When I got home,

1329
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,615
我爸妈在那里
and my mom and dad were there,

1330
01:17:04,616 --> 01:17:07,182
我的兄弟姐妹 我的妻子
my brothers and sisters, my wife.

1331
01:17:07,183 --> 01:17:08,883
我们拥抱和..
And we're embracing and...

1332
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:16,282
我不能跟我的妻子或母亲谈到
I couldn't relate to my wife
or my mother what I had seen,

1333
01:17:16,283 --> 01:17:19,680
在越南的所见所为
what I had done in Vietnam.

1334
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:22,014
我能跟兄弟们谈论这些
I could've talked to my brothers about it,

1335
01:17:22,015 --> 01:17:25,281
但他们知道我不想谈
but they, they knew I didn't want to.

1336
01:17:25,282 --> 01:17:28,213
所以这就是难言之隐
And so it just, uh,
something unsaid, you know.

1337
01:17:28,214 --> 01:17:30,280
“欢迎回来 文森
"Welcome back, Vince.

1338
01:17:30,281 --> 01:17:33,246
你历尽磨难 但欢迎你回来”
You've been through the, the
wringer, but welcome back."

1981年4月

at Andrews Air Force
Base outside Washington.

1343
01:17:46,945 --> 01:17:49,877
在那里他们要从1400多件投稿中

1345
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:55,778
越战纪念碑的优胜设计
from more than 1,400 submissions.

1346
01:17:59,578 --> 01:18:03,709
纪念碑是一名固执老兵的点子
The memorial was the brainchild
of a single stubborn veteran,

1347
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:06,741
前步兵简.克鲁格斯
a former rifleman named Jan Scruggs,

1348
01:18:06,742 --> 01:18:10,241
他在一次可怕的记忆闪回之后

told his wife he wanted
to "build a memorial

1350
01:18:13,108 --> 01:18:16,441
“给所有那些在越南服过役的人
"to all the guys who served in Vietnam.

1351
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,575
将会刻上所有阵亡者的名字”
It'll have the name of everyone killed."

1352
01:18:19,576 --> 01:18:21,173
和其他老兵一起

1490
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,449
墙上有那么多名字

1491

突然间我的喉咙肿起
And all of a sudden, my throat swole up,

1492
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:10,415
我想“我做不到

1493
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:12,614
我现在没法过去”

我崩溃了

我一直强忍着泪水..

我双膝跪倒 啜泣着

1498
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:34,913
我停不下来 无法呼吸

我感谢上帝 它在那里

以加入世界大家庭

他们想加入世界大家庭

1994年
NARRATOR: In 1994,

美国取消了贸易禁运

BARACK OBAMA: Now we can say something

1609
01:34:31,967 --> 01:34:33,764
曾经难以想象的话：

今天 越南和美国是伙伴

我们已经表明 人心可以改变
We have shown that hearts can change,

1612
01:34:42,665 --> 01:34:44,429
当我们拒绝成为过去的囚徒时
and that a different future is possible

1613
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:48,264
一个不同的未来就有可能
when we refuse to be prisoners of the past.

1614
01:34:50,264 --> 01:34:55,264
黎工训：住在城里的一些战友

1615
01:34:55,264 --> 01:34:58,264
经常见到美国老兵

1616
01:34:58,264 --> 01:35:01,264
他们互相语言不通

1617
01:35:01,264 --> 01:35:04,264

1618
01:35:04,264 --> 01:35:06,264
他们互相拥抱

1619

他们象老兵对老兵一样互相对待

1620
01:35:10,264 --> 01:35:14,264
我们忘掉过去

1621
01:35:18,264 --> 01:35:23,264
虽然我身上还留有弹片

1622
01:35:23,264 --> 01:35:27,264
我想结束战争这一篇章

1623
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:30,264
现在我们应该向前看

1624
01:35:30,264 --> 01:35:36,264
当我们的孩子能去美国上学

1625

从那里学到最精华的东西

1626
