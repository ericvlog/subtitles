47
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,255
:原谅我，大人。我不能。
Father Fox: Forgive me, My Lord. I can't.

48
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:55,649
俄国主教:你会拒绝召唤?
Russian Bishop: You would refuse the call?

49
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,566
这位修女，尤利娅修女，点名要见你。
This nun, Sister Yulia, has asked for you by name.

50
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,437
我已经通知过你很多次了。
Father Fox: I have given you plenty notice.

51
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,918
应你的要求，我多待了几个月，
Stayed on months longer than I should have, at your request,

52
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,528
我不相信的驱魔仪式
performed exorcisms I don't believe in...

53
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,835
这不是驱魔仪式。
Well, this isn't an exorcism.

54
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,751
这是对神圣事件的证实
This is verification of a divine event

55
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,101
——还有一些翻译。主教，我很抱歉。
- and some translating. - Father Fox: Bishop, I'm sorry.

57
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:18,410
大人，我救了那个女孩
Father Fox: [in English] My Lord, I saved that girl

58
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,890
是她的家人，不是魔鬼。
from her family, not the devil.

59
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,457
我一直在与精神疾病作斗争。
I was fighting mental illness.

60
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:26,549
没人能治愈她的时候你治好了她。
You healed her when nobody else could.

61
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:28,725
你否认吗?
Do you deny that?

62
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,814
我做了所有牧师都该做的事。
I did what all priests are supposed to do.

63
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,686
我给了她我的爱和关注。
I gave her my love and attention.

64
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,905
我让她意识到她的生命是有价值的，
I made her realize that her life had value,

65
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,516
她是上帝的孩子
that she was a child of God.

66
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:38,735
就在那时，她的病停止了。
That is when her illness stopped.

67
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,129
俄国主教:嗯，也许，
Russian Bishop: Mm. Perhaps,

68
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,261
但尤利娅修女的情况似乎有所不同。
but Sister Yulia's case seems to be different.

69
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,264
当地牧师已经证实了它的真实性。
Local priests have confirmed its authenticity.

70
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,267
我该向前看了。
It's time for me to move on.

71
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,966
做一个好基督徒，不要做一个坏牧师。
To be a good Christian rather than a bad priest.

72
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,229
俄罗斯主教:你真的不应该这么内疚
Russian Bishop: You really shouldn't feel so guilty

73
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:55,665
感谢你所做的一切。
for what you have done.

74
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:58,233
祭司的独身主义植根于传统。
Priestly celibacy is rooted in tradition.

75
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,018
不是天主教教义。
Not Catholic dogma.

76
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,281
如果这只是婚外情，而我打算结束这一切，
If it were just an affair and I planned to end things,

77
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,546
这将是不同的。但是…(笑)……我爱这个女人。
it would be different. But... [chuckles] ...I love this woman.

78
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:10,941
她怀的孩子应该有个真正的父亲。
And the child she's carrying deserves a real father.

79
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,161
毫米。
Mm.

80
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,427
说到爱，
Speaking of love,

81
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:24,172
这位修女，尤利娅修女，怀了双胞胎。
this nun, Sister Yulia, is pregnant with twins.

82
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,217
她说它是完美无瑕的。
She claims it's immaculate.

83
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:29,307
她说她的两个未出生的孩子会和她说话，
She says her two unborn kids talk to her,

84
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,745
而且她知道其中一个是好人
and that she knows that one of them is good

85
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,660
一个是邪恶的。
and one is evil.

86
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,665
帮我读一下，好吗?
Take a read, would you, for me?

87
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,146
[叹气]
Father Fox: [sighs]

88
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:46,586
红衣主教罗素将亲自监督核查工作。
Cardinal Russo will personally oversee the verification.

89
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:48,805
他是古代语言方面的专家
He's an expert in ancient languages,

90
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:49,980
就像你一样。
just like you.

91
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,592
为什么梵蒂冈派一个著名学者来?
Why's the Vatican sending a famous scholar?

92
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,984
我是说，像罗素主教那样的人
I mean, someone like Cardinal Russo

93
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,290
有一天会成为教皇。
could be Pope someday.

94
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:59,729
这说明梵蒂冈对这个案子有多重视。
It shows you how seriously the Vatican is taking this case.

95
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:08,085
劳拉:[喘着气]看。
Laura: [gasps] Look.

97
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,353
-过来，柏拉图。嘿。嗨。
- Come here, Plato. Hey. - Laura: Hi.

98
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,272
兄弟，过来。
Buddy, come here.

99
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,189
事情进展如何?
How did it go?

100
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,148
和我预料的一样。
Father Fox: As well as expected.

101
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,367
你感觉怎么样?
How you feeling?

102
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,023
劳拉:今天早上有点不舒服，但我会没事的。
Laura: A little sick this morning, but I'll be okay.

104
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:46,994
精神分裂症，受虐待的童年……
Schizophrenia, abusive childhood...

105
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:50,127
圣灵感孕说。
immaculate conception.

106
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,913
这个女人需要帮助。
[exhales heavily] This woman needs help.

107
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,089
你该走了。
You should go.

108
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:56,568
你知道她并没有被附身。
You know she's not actually possessed.

109
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,222
劳拉:我知道，但是……
Laura: I know that, but...

110
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,051
这不是一个虔诚的基督徒吗?
isn't this being a good Christian,

111
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,749
而不是一个坏牧师?
rather than a bad priest?

112
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,448
-取笑我?-(笑)我不是。
- Making fun of me? - [laughs] I'm not.

113
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:10,017
我是说即使你要假扮成牧师
I'm saying that even if you have to pretend to be a priest

114
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,889
帮助这个女人，这才是基督徒。没有?
to help this woman, that's Christian. No?

115
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,762
严格来说，我还是个牧师。
Well, technically, I still am a priest.

116
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,504
但是…我现在有了不同的目标。
But... I have a different purpose now.

117
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,420
我不想因为这件事离开你。
I don't want this to take me away from you.

118
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,337
它不会把我从你身边带走。
It won't take me away from you.

120
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,170
我得去爱沙尼亚工作。
I have to go to Estonia for work.

121
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,520
你可能会比我先回来。
You'll probably be back before I am.

122
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:41,831
等我回来，我们应该谈谈加拿大的事。
And when I get back, we should talk about Canada.

123
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:46,662
我觉得埃德蒙顿是个很适合组建家庭的地方。
I think Edmonton would be a great place to raise a family.

124
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,883
告诉主教这是最后一个了，
But tell the bishop it's the last one,

125
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,406
而且你是认真的。
and that you mean it.

132
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,736
斯尼格修女:尊敬的鲁索枢机主教。
Sister Sniger: [in English] His Eminence, Cardinal Russo.

133
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,611
你的卓越。这是我的荣幸。
Your Eminence. It's such an honor.

134
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,266

[in Russian]

135
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,138
我读过你所有的作品。
[in English] I have read all of your work.

136
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,185
你知道我有多受宠若惊吗
I can't tell you how flattered I was

137
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,839
经常被提及
to be referenced so often

138
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:03,059
在你关于楔形文字的博士论文里。
in your doctoral thesis on the cuneiform alphabet.

139
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:04,800
你读了我的论文?
You read my thesis?

140
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,324
似乎不管一个人有多老，
It seems no matter how old one gets,

141
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,196
总有东西要学
there's always something to learn

142
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,545
从下一代开始。
from the next generation.

143
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,766
如果你不介意的话，我想给你看点东西。
Now if you don't mind, I'd like to show you something.

144
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,531
红衣主教罗素:什么事，神父?
Cardinal Russo: What is it, Father?

145
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,100
你有疑问吗?
You have doubts?

146
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,887
对不起，主教大人。
Father Fox: I'm sorry, Your Eminence.

147
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,193
外面越冷，我们用的热水就越多，
The colder it gets outside, the more hot water we use,

148
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,891
当热水穿过冷空气时，
and when hot water passes through cold air,

149
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,980
就会发生冷凝。
you get condensation.

150
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,248
除了最初的报告之外，还有什么新进展吗?
Have there been any developments outside the initial report?

151
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:03,554
尤利娅修女拒绝和任何人说话……
Sister Yulia refuses to talk with anyone...

152
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:05,774
除了你。
except you.

153
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,863
索尔神父:你知道这是为什么吗?
Father Saul: Do you have any idea why that might be?

154
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:16,002
啊。狐狸神父，请允许我介绍索尔神父。
Ah. Father Fox, please allow me to introduce Father Saul.

155
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:25,141
我猜摩尔曼斯克发生的事，或者…
I, uh, suppose what happened in Murmansk, or...

156
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,622
也许是因为俄罗斯的天主教徒太少了。
perhaps because there are so few Catholics in Russia.

157
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:31,931
我明白了。
I see.

158
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,195
斯尼格修女:[俄语]
Sister Sniger: [in Russian]

159
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,519
[门开了]
[door creaks open]

160
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,271

[in Russian]

161
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,621
尤利娅修女:下午好，父亲。
Sister Yulia: [in English] Good afternoon, Father.

162
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:14,408

[in Russian]

163
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,065
你会说英语。
[in English] You speak English.

164
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:22,677
尤利娅修女:是的。
Sister Yulia: Yes.

165
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:25,245
他们没告诉我。
They didn't tell me that.

166
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:27,856
你在哪里学的英语?
Where did you learn English?

167
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,815
(重重地呼了口气)我没有。
[exhales heavily] I didn't.

168
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,298
呃。这是我能说英语的唯一原因
Uh. The only reason I'm able to speak English

169
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,257
是为了和你谈谈
is so that I can speak with you.

170
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,002
你为什么不告诉我你为什么要当修女?
Why don't you tell me why you became a nun?

171
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,270
为目的。在第一位。
For purpose. At first.

172
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,534
然后随着时间流逝，
Then as time goes by,

173
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,233
你意识到你是来死的。
you realize that you have come here to die.

174
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:02,064
但对我来说，上帝说:“不。”
But in my case, God said, "No."

175
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,806
所以他给了我孩子，
And that is why he's given me children,

176
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,590
因为他想让我活下去。
because he wants me to live.

177
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:12,683
你不认为这些孩子来自上帝。
You don't think that these children are from God.

178
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,556
我认为所有的孩子都来自上帝。
I think all children are from God.

179
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,909
嗯，我想你是对的。
Well, I suppose that you are right.

180
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,611
你为什么要找我?
Why did you ask to speak to me?

181
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,918
尤利娅修女:嗯……
Sister Yulia: Uh...

182
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,226
他们……他们告诉我一些事情。
They... they tell me things.

183
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,055
这些事我无从知晓。
Things I would have no other way of knowing.

184
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,362
他们跟我说了你的事。
And they told me about you.

185
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,452
他们跟你说了我什么?
What did they tell you about me?

186
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,281
他们告诉我你是唯一的一个
They told me you are the only one

187
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:48,545
这样可以防止坏事发生。
that can keep the bad thing from happening.

188
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,375
你觉得你会出事吗?
You think something bad is gonna happen to you?

189
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:55,074
尤利娅修女:我今天没有带你来这里，父亲。
Sister Yulia: I didn't bring you here today, Father.

190
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,380
不是教会带你来的。
The Church didn't bring you here.

191
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,165
上帝把你带到这里。
God brought you here.

192
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,559
他们试图阻止他的计划。
They are trying to stop His plan.

193
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:03,734
[门开了]
[door creaks open]

194
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,997
他们认为自己懂得更多。
They think they know better.

195
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:09,000
嗯。我们还没说完
Um. We're not finish--

196
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,654
老修女:[俄语]
Old Nun: [in Russian]

197
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,352
我们需要你的帮助。
[in English] We need your help.

198
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:13,570
嘿，妹妹。我们不是……
Father Fox: Hey, Sister. We're not...

199
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,272
[门开了]
[door creaks open]

200
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,455
[记者在电视上讲话]
[reporter speaking on TV]

201
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,458
[俄语]
Father Fox: [in Russian]

202
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,721
[记者在电视上继续讲话]
[reporter speaking on TV continues]

203
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:58,963
你想见我，
Father Fox: [in English] You wanted to see me,

204
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,400
-主教阁下?——啊。
- Your Eminence? - Ah.

205
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,576
狐狸爸爸。请进。
Father Fox. Please come in.

206
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,100
-随便喝一杯吧。-我不应该。
- Uh, help yourself to a drink. - Father Fox: I shouldn't.

207
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:08,321
如你所愿。你认识这种语言吗?
As you wish. Do you recognize this language?

208
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,933
显然是楔形文字，但不是苏美尔文字。
It's cuneiform, obviously, but it's not Sumerian.

209
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,369
它不是阿卡德语。
It's not Akkadian.

210
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,197
这是我从未见过的音节表。
It's a syllabary I've never seen before.

211
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,504
我相信这是一种秘密语言
I believe this to be a secretive language

212
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,246
由琐罗亚斯德教祭司的精英阶层使用。
used by an elite class of Zoroastrian priests.

213
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,074
有点像德鲁伊教失传的语言。
Kind of like the lost language of the druids.

214
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,946
这是原文，
And this is the original text,

215
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,208
从一个人转到另一个人
transferred from person to person

216
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:27,905
几千年来。
for thousands of years.

217
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,951
这是写在什么材料上的?
Father Fox: What, uh, kind of material is this written on?

218
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,474
红衣主教罗素:还有其他的。看。
Cardinal Russo: There are others. Look.

219
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,389
所有这些都在讲述同样的故事。
All of these are telling the same story.

220
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:36,479
希伯来语，科普特语，阿拉伯语，阿维斯陀语和阿卡德语。
Hebrew, Coptic, Arabic, Avestan, and Akkadian.

221
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,353
"处女必生双胞胎男孩，
"A virgin will give birth to twin boys,

222
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,225
一善一恶。”
one good, one evil."

223
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,185
在弥赛亚学会爱之前，
"Before the Messiah can learn to love,

224
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,622
反基督者会试图杀死他的兄弟。”
the Antichrist will try and kill his brother."

225
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:50,667
“他会利用圣人……”
"He will use the holy man... "

226
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:53,148
两人:“……士兵和父亲。”
Both: "...the soldier, and the father."

227
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,458
我觉得这个词不应该是指"处女"
I don't think this word is supposed to mean "virgin."

228
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:00,460
我认为这暗示了弥赛亚
I think it implies that the Messiah

229
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:03,071
会生童贞女，但那是魔鬼吗
will be born a virgin birth, but that the devil

230
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,029
必须通过自由意志进入她体内。
will have to enter her through free will.

231
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,251
她将不得不选择和一个男人做爱。
She'll have to choose to have sex with a man.

232
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:10,948
当然可以。
Of course.

233
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,430
我怎么没想到呢?
Why didn't I think of that?

234
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:19,696
[令人不安的音乐播放]
[unsettling music playing]

235
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,849
[令人不安的音乐消逝]
[unsettling music fades]

236
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,899
你觉得这个预言可能是真的。
You think this prophecy might be real.

237
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,292
很有可能。
It's quite possible.

238
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,815
尤利娅姐姐怀了一对双胞胎男孩。
Sister Yulia is carrying twin boys.

239
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:54,992
这是琐罗亚斯德教的经文，
This is Zoroastrian scripture,

240
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,472
比基督早一千多年。
more than a thousand years before Christ.

241
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,518
其他人和我都相信这个预言
The others and I believe that this prophecy

242
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,868
是和《启示录》一样神圣的启示。
is as divinely inspired as the Book of Revelation.

243
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,132
这不是基督教。
It's not Christian.

244
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,831
我听说你是个多疑的人。
I was told you were a bit of a doubting Thomas.

245
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:13,054
主教大人，从我今天在这里看到的情况来看…
Your Eminence, from what I've seen here today...

246
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,058
更别提尤利娅修女的精神病史了
not to mention Sister Yulia's history of mental illness,

247
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,713
要是我说了算，她早就进医院了。
if it were up to me, she would already be in a hospital.

248
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:25,109
她像个孩子一样看待事物。她不理解的幻象。
She saw things as a child. Visions she didn't understand.

249
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,504
她的父母，医生，每个人都在想
Her parents, doctors, everyone thought

250
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:31,246
她产生了幻觉，所以他们给她用药，
she was hallucinating so they medicated her,

251
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:36,120
而事实上，我相信她看到了上帝的幻象。
when, in fact, I believe she saw visions from God.

252
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,867

(低沉的哭)

258
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:22,645
谢谢你，狐狸爸爸。你帮了大忙了。
Thank you, Father Fox. You've been most helpful.

259
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,647
你解雇。
You're dismissed.

260
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:31,045
主教大人。
Father Fox: Your Eminence.

罗素枢机主教(低语):大多数人类
Cardinal Russo: [whispering] Most of humanity

289
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:08,191
将被打入地狱。

索尔神父:在我们引产的时候，它可以让她保持镇静。

291
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,067
红衣主教罗素:劳动?我以为这是堕胎。
Cardinal Russo: Labor? I thought this was an abortion.

292
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:15,851
索尔神父:是的。
Father Saul: It is.

293
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:19,376
但在怀孕后期，必须这样做。
But this late in the pregnancy, this is how it has to be done.

红衣主教罗素:但如果你错了呢?
Cardinal Russo: But what if you're wrong?

295
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,817
我们对教会负责。遵从基督的教诲。
Our duty is to the Church. To the teachings of Christ.

296
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:28,168
我们不能杀死圣婴。
We cannot kill the Christ child.

297
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:29,517
我们必须这么做。
We have to.

298

如果他们出生了，
If they are born,

299

他们会带来世界末日。
they'll bring about the end of days.

300
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,790
选择是我们的负担，是我们的牺牲。

那是上帝之声在地球上的使命，主教大人。

这就是你被派来做的事?
That's what you've been sent here to do?

306

当敌基督和弥赛亚

307

会一起出生。但不是现在。

313

你是圣彼得教堂的红衣主教。
you are a Cardinal of the Church of Saint Peter.

315
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,719
如果你这样做，你会下地狱的。
If you do this, you will damn yourself to hell.

316
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:42,851
很抱歉，但是上帝之声…
I'm sorry, but vox Dei...

317
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,593
Vox一些吗?神……上帝的声音吗?这是什么意思?
Vox Dei? God... God's Voice? What does that mean?

318
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,204
我们肩负着保护人类的责任。
We are charged with protecting humanity.

当人类离上帝最远的时候。
when mankind is furthest from God.

322
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,264
主教大人，她只是个女孩。
Your Eminence, she's just a girl.

323
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:10,749
她想要这些孩子。
She wants these children.
